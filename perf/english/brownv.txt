    Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at_the_time of their arrest , Judge_James_B._Parsons was told in Criminal_court yesterday.
     The disclosure by Charles_Bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed_as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial.
     Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge_Parsons to grant his client , Alan_Clements , 30 , a separate trial.
   Bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom.
      The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client  , Bellows told the court.
    Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen_property.
   It is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and_others .
     Judge_Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired ,  You mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this ?
      Yes , your honor  , replied Bellows.
    What this amounts to , if true , is that there will be a free-for-all fight in_this case.
   There is a conflict among the defendants .
     President_Kennedy today pushed_aside other White_House business to devote all his time and attention to working_on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide television and radio.
     The President spent much of the week-end at his summer home on Cape_Cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of White_House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone.
     Shortly after the Chief_Executive returned to Washington in midmorning from Hyannis_Port , Mass. , a White_House spokesman said the address text still had  quite a way_to_go  toward completion.
     Asked to elaborate , Pierre_Salinger , White_House press secretary , replied ,  I would say it 's got to go thru several more drafts .
     Salinger said the work President_Kennedy , advisers , and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording , rather_than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis precipitated by Russia 's demands and proposals for the city.
     The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov.
8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting_Judge_John_M._Karns , who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence  by unfair and fundamentally illegal means .
     Karns said that the cases involved a matter  of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence  of the 50 persons.
   He said evidence was obtained  in violation of the legal_rights of citizens .
     Karns ' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases.
   In the two other cases he ruled that the state had been  unable to make a case .
   Contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by Morris_J._Wexler , special prosecutor.
     Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand_jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation , questioned the individuals in the Criminal_courts building , but did not take them before the grand_jury.
     Mayer_Goldberg , attorney for election judges in the 58 th precinct of the 23 d ward , argued this procedure constituted intimidation.
   Wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning.
     Karns said it was a  wrongful act  for Wexler to take statements  privately and outside of the grand_jury room .
   He said this constituted a  very serious misuse  of the Criminal_court processes.
      Actually , the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal_court of Cook county , altho vindication of the authority of_that court is not the function of_this court  , said Karns , who is a City judge in East St._Louis sitting in Cook_County court.
     Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons.
   Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with  complementary  miscount of the vote , in_which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another.
     The cases involved judges in the 33 d , 24 th , and 42 d precincts of the 31 st ward , the 21 st and 28 th precincts of the 29 th ward , the 18 th precinct of the 4 th ward , and the 9 th precinct of the 23 d ward.
     The case of the judges in the 58 th precinct of the 23 d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by Karns.
   Two other cases also were under advisement.
     After reading his statement discharging the 23 d ward case , Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpoenaed , he would dismiss them.
     President_Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical_care program whereby social_security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical_bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by social_security or railroad retirement programs.
     The President , in a special message to Congress , tied_in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships , build 20 new medical and 20 new dental_schools , and expand child health_care and general medical research.
     The aged care plan , similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator , a fight on Capitol_hill.
   It was defeated in Congress last year.
     It would be financed by boosting the social_security payroll tax by as much_as $ 37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes.
     The social_security payroll tax is now 6 per_cent - 3 per_cent on each worker and employer - on the first $ 4800 of pay per_year.
   The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $ 5000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per_cent - 3.25 per_cent each.
   Similar payroll tax_boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system.
     The payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per_cent starting Jan. 1 , 1963 , if the plan is approved , because the levy is already scheduled to go_up by 1 per_cent on_that date to pay for other social_security costs.
     Officials estimated the annual tax_boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid_out would run 1 billion or more in the first year , 1963.
   Both figures would go higher in later years.
     Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years.
   These would be paid for out of general , not payroll , taxes.
     The aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social_security and railroad retirement systems :     Full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness , except that the patient would pay $ 10 a day of the cost for the first nine days.
     Full payment of nursing_home bills for up_to 180 days following discharge from a hospital.
   A patient could receive up_to 300 days paid-for nursing_home care under a  unit formula  allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit.
     Hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in_excess of $ 20 a patient.
     Community visiting_nurse services at_home for up_to 240 days an illness.
     The President noted that Congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical_bills of the needy aged.
     He said his plan is designed to  meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers ' expense , but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings - or those of their children - caused by an extended hospital stay .
      This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs  , he said ,  and with sufficient ' deductible ' requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals.
      This is not a program of socialized medicine.
   It is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed.
   Every person will choose his own doctor and hospital .
     The plan does not cover doctor bills.
   They would still be paid by the patient.
     Apart from the aged care plan the President 's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships , and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental_schools.
     The President said the nation 's 92 medical and 47 dental_schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health_care.
   Moreover , he said , many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they can n't afford the schooling costs.
     The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental_school equal_to $ 1500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students.
   The schools could use the money to pay 4 - year scholarships , based on need , of up_to $ 2000 a year per student.
     In_addition , the government would pay a $ 1000  cost of education  grant to the schools for each $ 1500 in scholarship grants.
   Officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go_up to 21 millions by 1966.
     The President recommended federal  matching grants  totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental_schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones.
     In the area of  community health services  , the President called_for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing_home construction.
   He asked for another 10 million dollar  initial  appropriation for  stimulatory grants  to states to improve nursing_homes.
     He further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals.
     In the child health field , the President said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children 's bureau.
   He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute.
     The President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation.
   He did not say by how much.
     For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase , from 30 to 50 millions , in matching grants for building research facilities.
   The President said he will also propose increasing , by an unspecified amount , the 540 million dollars in the 1961 - 62 budget for direct government research in medicine.
     The President said his proposals combine the  indispensable elements in a sound health program - people , knowledge , services , facilities , and the means to pay for them .
     Congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines.
   Legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social_security system criticized the President 's plan.
   Those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message.
     Senate_Republican_Leader_Dirksen [ Ill.
 ] and House_Republican_Leader_Charles_Halleck [ Ind.
 ] said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance.
   Halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first.
     House_Speaker_Sam_Rayburn [ D. , Tex.
 ] called the Kennedy program  a mighty fine thing  , but made no prediction on its fate in the House.
     Acting hastily under White_House pressure , the Senate tonight confirmed Robert_C._Weaver as the nation 's federal housing chief.
     Only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote.
   A_number_of scattered  ayes  and  noes  was heard.
     Customary_Senate rules were ignored in_order_to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency.
     In the last eight years , all Presidential appointments , including those of cabinet rank , have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at_least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor.
     The rule was enforced by demand of Sen._Wayne_Morse [ D. , Ore.
 ] in connection with President_Eisenhower 's cabinet selections in 1953 and President_Kennedy 's in 1961.
    
    The_most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization Foreign_Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual_understanding than in past meetings.
     This has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step_by_step and without dramatic changes.
   In Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another 's problems.
     This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the  colonialist  powers and those who have never , or not for a long_time , had such problems.
   The nightmare of a clash between those in_trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicious by its absence.
     In the case of Portugal , which a_few weeks ago was rumored ready_to walk_out_of the NATO_Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension.
   The general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council.
   There should even be no_more bitter surprises in the UN General_Assembly as to NATO members ' votes , since a new ad_hoc NATO committee has been set_up so_that in_the_future such topics as Angola will be discussed in_advance.
     Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO locomotive.
   Even Norway , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of_this northernmost capital of the alliance , is today closer to the NATO line.
     On_the_negative_side of the balance_sheet must be set some disappointment that the United_States leadership has not been as much in_evidence as hoped_for.
   One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary_of_State Dean_Rusk 's speeches as  inconclusive .
   But he hastened to add that , if United_States policies were not always clear , despite Mr._Rusk 's analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the West , this may merely mean the new administration has not_yet firmly fixed its policy.
     A certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair , with no_fewer_than six Soviet correspondents accredited.
     The impression has nevertheless been given during these three days , despite Mr._Rusk 's personal popularity , that the United_States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame_of_mind , more ready_to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots.
     The Secretary_of_State himself , in his first speech , gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United_States that has preoccupied the new administration in_the_past four months.
     But where the core of NATO is concerned , the Secretary_of_State has not_only reiterated the United_States ' profound attachment to the alliance ,  cornerstone  of its foreign_policy , but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at NATO 's disposal in European waters.
     The Secretary_of_State has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet_Union that the United_States will not stand_for another setback in Berlin , an affirmation once_again taken_up by the council as_a_whole.
     The secretary 's greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of NATO realization that East-West friction , wherever it take_place around the globe , is in_essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies , and must be treated as_such without regard_to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection.
     The annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions : more , deeper , and more timely political consultation within the alliance , the use of the Organization for Economic_Cooperation and Development ( when ratified ) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries , and the need for strengthening conventional forces as_well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent.
     This increase in the  threshold  , as the conventional forces strengthening is called , will prove one of the alliance 's most difficult problems in the months to come.
   Each ally will have to carry_out obligations long_since laid_down , but never completely fulfilled.
     The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a Geneva conference on Laos just_as serious debate over its foreign_policy erupts for_the_first_time.
     There is little optimism here that the Communists will be any_more docile at the conference_table than they were in military_actions on_the_ground in Laos.
     The United_States , State_Department officials explain , now is mainly interested in setting_up an international inspection system which will prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring Thailand and South Viet_Nam.
     They count_on the aid of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve this.
     The United_States hopes that any future Lao_Cabinet would not become Communist dominated.
   But it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility.
     The inclination here is to accept a de_facto cease-fire in Laos , rather_than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conference.
     This is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled to make.
   It excuses these actions as being the chain_reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration.
     Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas.
     But with the months moving_on - and the immediate confrontations with the Communists showing no gain for the free_world - the question arises :     How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign_policy decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression?
     Former Vice-President_Richard_M._Nixon in Detroit called_for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet_Union.
   He was critical of_what he feels is President_Kennedy 's tendency to be too conciliatory.
     It does not take a Gallup poll to find_out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the situation as Republicans see it.
   They can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether Republicans , if they had been in power , would have made  amateurish and monumental blunders  in Cuba.
     One Republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he did n't attack the Kennedy administration on this score.
   His reply , he said , was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now.
   But he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first.
     The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through Senator_Thruston_B._Morton ( R ) of Kentucky , chairman of the Republican_National_Committee , that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist domination.
     Kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 Harvard , Boston_University , Brandeis , and Massachusetts_Institute of Technology educators.
     This group pleads with the administration to  give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by exile groups .
   It recommends that the United_States  seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations ; and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin_America the social conditions on_which totalitarian nationalism feeds .
     Mr._Nixon , for his part , would oppose intervention in Cuba without specific provocation.
   But he did recommend that President_Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated.
     Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories in Laos , almost any observer would have said that President_Kennedy had blended a program that respected , generally , the opinions voiced both by Mr._Nixon and the professors.
     Very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels , a high official source disclosed , that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration.
     Strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements.
   Policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed.
   But thus_far there has been no response in_kind.
     Foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations.
     In Laos , the administration looked_at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gesture.
     Again_and_again it asked the Communists to  freeze  the military situation in Laos.
   But the Communists aided the Pathet_Lao at an even faster rate.
     And after several correspondents went_into Pathet_Lao territory and exposed the huge build-up , administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a  great service  and laid the_matter before the Southeast_Asia_Treaty_Organization.
     SEATO was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping_with the military losses in Laos.
   But the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one_time for the United_States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos.
   ( Some SEATO nations disagreed , however.
 )     There was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that Laos was ill_suited to be an ally , unlike its more determined neighbors , Thailand and South Viet_Nam.
     The administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos.
   The pro-Western government , which the United_States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna_Phouma  neutralist  government , never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal_Lao_Army.
     There certainly was not_any more energy displayed after it was clear the United_States would not back the pro-Western government to_the_hilt.
     If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince_Souvanna_Phouma , whom it felt was too trusting of Communists , it gradually had to relinquish them.
     One factor was the statement of Senator_J._W._Fulbright ( D ) of Arkansas , chairman of the Senate_Foreign Relations Committee.
   He declared on March_25 that the United_States had erred a year and a half ago by  encouraging the removal  of Prince_Souvanna.
     The White_House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid_growth of juvenile_delinquency in the United_States.
     The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the  vitality of the nation .
     In an important assertion of national leadership in_this field , he has issued an executive order establishing the President 's committee on Juvenile_Delinquency and Crime , to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory_Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems.
     The President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend.
     The President has also called_upon the Attorney_General , the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , and the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts  in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope_with the problem.
     Simultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David_L._Hackett , a special assistant ot the Attorney_General , as executive_director of the new Committee on Juvenile_Delinquency and Youth Crime.
     His sense of urgency in_this matter stems from the fact that court cases ond juvenile arrests have more_than doubled since 1948 , each_year showing an increase in offenders.
     Among arrests reported by the Federal_Bureau of Investigation in 1959 , about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of_age.
    
    East_Providence should organize its civil_defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director , Raymond_H._Hawksley , the present city CD head , believes.
     Mr._Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city_council  or anyone else locally  to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time.
     East_Providence now has no civil_defense program.
   Mr._Hawksley , the state 's general treasurer , has been a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine years.
   He is not interested in being named a full-time director.
     Noting that President_Kennedy has handed the Defense_Department the major responsibility for the nation 's civil_defense program , Mr._Hawksley said the federal_government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director.
     He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about $ 3500 a year and would only have to put_up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs.
     Mr._Hawksley said he believed there are a_number_of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time CD job.
   One of these men is former Fire_Chief John_A._Laughlin , he said.
     Along with a director , the city should provide a CD headquarters so_that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized.
   Mr._Hawksley said.
     One advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director , he said , is that East_Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal_government for financial_aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil_defense program.
     Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios , sirens and rescue trucks , he said.
     Mr._Hawksley believes that East_Providence could use two more rescue trucks , similar to the CD vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire_Station.
     He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the other to the Rumford area.
     Speaking of the present status of civil_defense in the city , Mr._Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more_than one person in a_hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack.
     The Narragansett_Race_Track grounds is one assembly point , he said , and a drive-in theater in Seekonk would be another.
   Riverside residents would go_to the Seekonk assembly point.
     Mr._Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in_case of an air_attack.
     Such vital information , he said , has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know.
     If the city_council fails to consider appointment of a full-time CD director , Mr._Hawksley said , then he plans to call a meeting early in September so_that a civil_defense organization will be developed locally.
     One of the first things he would do , he said , would be to organize classes in first_aid.
   Other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal_government.
     Rhode_Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind.
     Governor_Notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come_up with recommendations for possible changes in_time for the next session of the General_Assembly.
     The governor 's move into the so-called  blue_law  controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss_Mary_R._Grant , deputy city clerk of Central_Falls.
   A copy was released to the press.
     Mr._Notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the Central_Falls City_Council on July 10 and sent to the state house by Miss_Grant.
   The resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature.
     While the city_council suggested that the Legislative_Council might perform the review , Mr._Notte said that instead he will take_up the_matter with Atty._Gen._J._Joseph_Nugent to get  the benefit of his views .
   He will then appoint the study committee with Mr._Nugent 's cooperation , the governor said.
      I would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings  , Mr._Notte said ,  to obtain the views of the general public and religious , labor and special-interest groups affected by these laws .
     The governor wrote Miss_Grant that he has been concerned for_some_time  with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law_enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales .
     The attorney_general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the_blue laws.
   Should there be evidence they are shirking , he has said , the state police will step_into the situation.
     There has been more activity across the state_line in Massachusetts than in Rhode_Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales laws.
   The statutes , similar in both the Bay_State and Rhode_Island and dating_back in some instances to colonial times , severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the Sabbath.
     The Central_Falls City_Council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday.
     The only day they  have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on Sunday  , the council 's resolution said.
   The small shops  must be retained , for they provide essential service to the community  , according to the resolution , which added that they  also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors .
   It declares that Sunday sales licenses provide  great revenue  to the local_government.
     The council advised the governor that  large supermarkets , factory outlets and department_stores not be allowed to do business  on Sunday.
   They  operate on a volume basis  , it was contended ,  and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community .
     Liberals and conservatives in both parties - Democratic and Republican - should divorce themselves and form two independent parties , George_H._Reama , nationally known labor-management expert , said here yesterday.
     Mr._Reama told the Rotary_Club of Providence at its luncheon at the Sheraton-Biltmore_Hotel that about half of the people in the country want the  welfare  type of government and the other half want a free_enterprise system.
   He suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election_day.
     He said he was  confessing that I was a member of the Socialist_Party in 1910 .
   That , he added , was when he was  a very young_man , a machinist and toolmaker by trade.
      That was before I studied law.
   Some of my fellow_workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist_Party.
   The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist track.
   He steered me to the right track - the free_enterprise track .
     He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910 , the party called_for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources.
   He suggested that without the Socialist_Party ever gaining a national victory , most_of its original program has come to pass under both major parties.
     Mr._Reama , who retired as vice_president of the American_Screw_Co. in 1955 said ,  Both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per_cent growth in the gross_national_product - but neither told us how to achieve it .
     He said he favors wage increases for workers -  but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze  - and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices , he added.
     Indicating the way in_which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy , Mr._Reama said :  A Socialist is a person who believes_in dividing everything he does not own .
   Mr._Reama , far from really being retired , is engaged in industrial relations counseling.
     A petition bearing the signatures of more_than 1700 Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home_rule charter for the town.
     William_A._Martinelli , chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston , transferred the petitions from his left_hand to his right_hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council_President_Raymond_Fortin_Sr..
     The law which governs home_rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman_of_the_board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and Mr._Martinelli happens to hold that post.
     Mr._Martinelli explained that there should be more_than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home_rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days.
   He explained that by_law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work.
     A difference_of_opinion arose between Mr._Martinelli and John_P._Bourcier , town solicitor , over the exact manner in_which the vote is handled.
   Mr._Martinelli has , in recent weeks , been of the opinion that a special town_meeting would be_called for the vote , while Mr._Bourcier said that a special election might be_called instead.
     Mr._Bourcier said that he had consulted several Superior_Court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures.
   He assured Mr._Martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible.
     Mr._Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement.
   He said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at_present , but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when_the_time_comes.
      After inspiring this , I think we should certainly follow_through on it  , he declared.
    It has become our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement .
     He said he would not be surprised if some of the more_than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission.
      Our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement  , he indicated ,  and to tell them what this will mean for the town .
   He expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in September.
     Some opposition to the home_rule movement started to be heard yesterday , with spokesmen for the town 's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home_rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter.
   Increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks , it was indicated.
     Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home_rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain signatures under what were termed  false pretenses .
   Several signers affixed their names , it was learned , after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the General_Assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take_over the Johnston_Sanitary_District sewer_system.
     Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police_station may be taken at Monday 's special North_Providence_Town_Council meeting.
     Council president Frank_SanAntonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request Town_Solicitor_Michael_A._Abatuno to draft the ordinance.
     At the last session of the General_Assembly , the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective.
   Nothing has been done yet to take_advantage of the enabling legislation.
     At_present all offenses must be taken to Sixth_District_Court for disposition.
   Local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense.
    
    James_P._Mitchell and Sen._Walter_H._Jones_R-Bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard_J._Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is  Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower_Republicanism .
     Mitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen._Wayne_Dumont_Jr._R-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park_Hotel.
     The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield_Young_Democratic_Club cocktail_party at the Scotch_Plains Country_Club.
   It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton_Monday at a forum of the State_Federation of Women 's Clubs.
     Hughes said Monday ,  It is the apparent intention of the Republican_Party to campaign on the carcass of_what they call Eisenhower_Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired.
   Now he 's gone , the Republican_Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state .
   Sunday he had added ,  We can love Eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the Republican_Party without his leadership .
     Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign.
    How can a man with any degree of common decency charge this ?
   he asked.
   The former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower_Republican  and proud to have absorbed his philosophy  while working in his adminstration.
     Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall 's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower_Republicanism was a dead issue.
     Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal attack on a past president.
    He is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign  , he said ,  because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re_arguing an old national campaign .
     The audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of Hughes ' remark.
     Dumont spoke on the merit of having an open_primary.
   He then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign.
   State aid to schools , the continuance of railroad passenger service , the proper uses of surplus funds of the Port of New_York Authority , and making New_Jersey attractive to new industry.
     Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the Meyner administration and the Republican-controlled State_Senate  Must share the blame for this .
   Nothing that Plainfield last year had lost the Mack_Truck_Co. plant , he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform.
      But I am not in favor of a sales or state income_tax at this time  , Mitchell said.
     Jones , unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions , saved his barbs for Mitchell.
   He said Mitchell is against the centralization of government in Washington but looks_to the Kennedy_Administration for aid to meet New_Jersey school and transportation crises.
      He calls_for help while saying he is against centralization , but you can n't have it both ways  , Jones said.
   The state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities , real_estate or motor_vehicles , he said ,  and I challenge Mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue .
     Earlier , Mitchell said in a statement :      I think that all Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President_Eisenhower by Richard_J._Hughes.
   His reference_to ' discredited carcass ' or ' tattered remains ' of the president 's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in_all history , to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people as president_of_the_United_States , and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations.
      I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in_public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste.
      Such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature.
   It can only rebound to Mr._Hughes ' discredit .
     Sen._Charles_W._Sandman , R-Cape_May , said today Jones will run well ahead of his GOP opponents for the gubernatorial nomination.
   Sandman , state campaign chairman for Jones , was addressing a meeting in the Military_Park_Hotel , Newark , of Essex_County leaders and campaign managers for Jones.
     Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all_over the state indicate that Jones will be chosen the Republican_Party 's nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years.
     Sandman said :  The announcement that Sen._Clifford_Case_R-N._J. , has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for Mr._Mitchell is a dead giveaway.
   It is a desperate effort to prop_up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about New_Jersey 's problems.
      We have witnessed in_this campaign the effort to project Mr._Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from Washington.
   That failed.
      We are now witnessing an effort to transfer to Mr._Mitchell some of the glow of Sen._Case 's candidacy of last year.
   That , too , will fail .
     Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs._Harriet_Copeland_Greenfield of 330 Woodland_Ave. , Westfield , as state chairman of the Republican_Women for Jones_Committee.
     Mrs._Greenfield is president of the Westfield_Women 's Republican_Club and is a Westfield county committeewoman.
     County_Supervisor_Weldon_R._Sheets , who is a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , today called_for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them.
   The proposal , Sheets said , represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in New_Jersey more_than a  lip_service word .
     Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting_machines , enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10 - year period without interest or charge.
   Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting_machines in the state by January , 1964.
     Although he pointed_out that mandatory legislation impinging_on home_rule is basically distasteful , he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county_lines.
     The candidacy of Mayor_James_J._Sheeran of West_Orange , for the Republican nomination for sheriff of Essex_County , was supported today by Edward_W._Roos , West_Orange public safety commissioner.
     Sheeran , a lawyer and former FBI man is_running against the Republican organization 's candidate , Freeholder_William_MacDonald , for the vacancy left by the resignation of Neil_Duffy , now a member of the State_Board of Tax Appeals.
      My experience as public safety commissioner  , Roos said ,  has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law_enforcement experience , and preferably one who is a lawyer.
   Jim_Sheeran fits that description .
     William_J._Seidel , state fire_warden in the Department of Conservation and Economic_Development , has retired after 36 years of service.
     A citation from Conservation_Commissioner_Salvatore_A._Bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest_fires in the state.
     Seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division fire_warden after graduation in 1921 from the University of Michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies.
   In October 1944 , he was appointed state warden and chief of the Forest_Fire Section.
     Under his supervision , the state fire-fighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting.
     He also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station.
   He introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire_wardens and first_aid training for section wardens.
   He is credited with setting_up an annual co-operative fire prevention program in co-operation with the Red_Cross and State_Department of Education.
     Richard_J._Hughes made his Morris_County debut in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge  to carry the issues to every corner of the state .
     He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee_members at the meeting in the Puddingstone_Inn :  When I come_back here after the November election you 'll think , ' You 're my man - you 're the kind_of governor we 're glad we elected  '.
     He said ,  We Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of_what is right and just , and not what is expedient at_the_time .
     In his only attack on the Republicans , Hughes said ,  The three Republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary.
   But we 'll have a liberal , well planned , forward looking , honest platform.
   We 'll not talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris_County and out of the other side in Hudson.
      We 'll take the truth to the people , and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in November .
     He said ,  You can see signs of the Republicans ' feeble attack on the Meyner administration.
   But I shall campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead .
     He urged New_Jersey to  become a full partner in the courageous actions of President_Kennedy .
   He called_for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by Southern states , and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry.
      We must keep the bloodstream of New_Jersey clean  , the former Superior_Court judge said.
    To prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the Republican administration in the early 1940 s .
     Calling the Democrats the  party that lives , breathes and thinks for the good of the people  , Hughes asked ,  a representative Democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in November .
     Hughes supported Gov._Meyner 's  Green_Acres  plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development.
   He said legislation for a $ 60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced Monday.
     The plan will provide $ 45 million for purchase of open land by the state.
   The other $ 15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis.
     Hughes said ,  This is not a plan to conquer space - but to conserve it  , pointing_out the state population has increased 125000 each_year since 1950.
   He said  Morris_County is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken _to preserve the green areas , there will be no land left to preserve .
     Hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in_which the Republican candidates are involved.
   He said no_matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans.
    After the primary  , he promised ,  I 'll be explicit on where I stand to bring you a strong , dynamic administration.
   I 'm not afraid to tangle_with the Republican nominee .
     Fifteen members of the Republican_State_Committee who are retiring - voluntarily - this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues.
     The outgoing members , whose four-year terms will expire a week after the April 18 primary_election , received carved wooden elephants , complete with ivory tusks , to remember the state committee by.
     There may be other 1961 state committee retirements come April 18 , but they will be leaving by_choice of the Republican voters.
     A special presentation was made to Mrs._Geraldine_Thompson of Red_Bank , who is stepping_down after 35 years on the committee.
   She also was the original GOP national committeewoman from New_Jersey in the early 1920 s following adoption of the women 's suffrage amendment.
   She served one four-year term on the national committee.
    
    Resentment welled_up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor_Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul_R._Screvane and Abraham_D._Beame as running_mates.
     At_the_same_time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal_party to the Mayor 's reported plan was generally favorable.
     Some anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic_party that has been going_on for the last three years.
     The resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor 's efforts to name his own running_mates without consulting the leaders.
   Some viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr._Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party.
     Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State_Controller_Arthur_Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr._Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept. 7 Democratic primary.
     These contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr._Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank_and_file in the city.
   Their view is that last-minute changes the Mayor is proposing to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as Mayor.
     In an apparent effort to head_off such a rival primary slate , Mr._Wagner talked by telephone yesterday with Representative_Charles_A._Buckley , the_Bronx Democratic leader , and with Joseph_T._Sharkey , the Brooklyn Democratic leader.
     As_usual , he made no attempt to get_in_touch with Carmine_G._De_Sapio , the Manhattan leader.
   He is publicly on record as believing Mr._De_Sapio should be replaced for the good of the party.
     Last night the Mayor visited Mr._Buckley at the_Bronx leader 's home for a discussion of the situation.
   Apparently he believes Mr._Buckley holds the key to the Democratic organization 's acceptance of his choices for running_mates without a struggle.
     In talks with Mr._Buckley last week in Washington , the Mayor apparently received the_Bronx leader 's assent to dropping Controller_Lawrence_E._Gerosa , who lives in the_Bronx , from this year 's ticket.
   But Mr._Buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr._Gerosa 's successor.
     The Mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted Mr._Screvane , who lives in Queens , to replace Abe_Stark , the incumbent , as the candidate for President of the City_Council and Mr._Beame , who lives in Brooklyn , to replace Mr._Gerosa as the candidate for Controller.
     The Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties Feis on the Hunter_College_Campus in the_Bronx.
   After his speech , reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions , published in yesterday 's New_York Times.
   The Mayor said :      It did n't come from me.
   But as I have said before , if I announce my candidacy , I will have something definite to say about running_mates .
     A wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in Massachusetts.
     There is a tangible feeling in_the_air of revulsion toward politics.
   The taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are  all_the_same .
      It 's ' See Joe , see Jim  ' , he says.
    The hand is out .
     A political_scientist writes_of the growth of  alienated voters  , who  believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt , selfish and beyond popular control.
   These voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy , the object of_which is to plunder them .
     Corruption is hardly_a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of Edwin_O ' Connor 's novel ,  The Last Hurrah .
   But there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject.
     A succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year.
   Graft in the construction of highways and other public_works has brought_on state and Federal investigations.
   And the election of President_Kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state.
     A reader of the Boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery , or worse , is the norm in Massachusetts public life.
   Day_after_day some new episode is reported.
     The state Public_Works Department is accused of having spent $ 8555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property.
   An assistant attorney_general is directed to investigate.
     Congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers.
     In the Senate , several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition.
   In the House , the Southern-Republican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the Administration 's housing bill , while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aid-to-education bill.
     The housing bill is now in the House_Rules_Committee.
   It is expected to be reported_out Tuesday , but this is a_little uncertain.
     The panel 's action depends_on the return of Representative_James_W._Trimble , Democrat of Arkansas , who has been siding with Speaker_Sam_Rayburn 's forces in the Rules_Committee in moving bills to the floor.
   Mr._Trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday.
     The housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans.
   The Democratic leadership , however , hopes to pass it sometime this week.
     The $ 6100000000 measure , which was passed last Monday by the Senate , provides_for forty-year mortgages at low down-payments for moderate-income families.
   It also provides_for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories.
     The education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the Rules_Committee , where two Northern Democratic members who usually vote with the Administration are balking because of the religious controversy.
   They are James_J._Delaney of Queens and Thomas_P._O ' Neill_Jr. of Massachusetts.
     What could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the National_Defense_Education_Act of 1958.
   This would provide_for long-term Federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school facilities for teaching science , languages and mathematics.
     Mr._Delaney and Mr._O ' Neill are not willing to vote on the public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the House_Education and Labor_Committee.
     About half of all Peace_Corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried_out by religious groups , according to an official of the corps.
     In the $ 40000000 budget that has been submitted for Congressional approval , $ 26000000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies.
     Twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage , Gordon_Boyce , director of relations with the voluntary agencies , said in a Washington interview.
   Six of these were proposed by religious groups.
   They will be for teaching , agriculture and community development in Southeast_Asia , Africa , the Middle_East and Latin_America.
     Interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the Peace_Corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods , means and goals.
     There are a_number_of ways this could happen , the churchmen pointed_out , and here is an example :     Last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered when he came_to pay his hotel_bill that the usual rate had been doubled.
   When he protested , the hotel owner said :      Why do you worry?
   The U._S._Government is paying for it.
   The U._S._Government pays for all its overseas workers .
      I do n't work for the Government  , the American said.
    I 'm a missionary .
     The hotel owner shrugged.
    Same thing  , he said.
     And_then , some churchmen remarked , there is a more classical church-state problem :     Can religious agencies use Government funds and Peace_Corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state?
     R._Sargent_Shriver_Jr. , director of the corps , is certain that they can.
   No religious group , he declared in an interview , will receive Peace_Corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes.
     At a gay party in the Kremlin for President_Sukarno of Indonesia , Premier_Khrushchev pulled_out his pockets and said , beaming :  Look , he took everything I had !
     Mr._Khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful banker.
   Indonesia is one of the twenty under-developed countries of Asia , Africa and Latin_America that are receiving Soviet aid.
     The Soviet_Union and other members of the Communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic , technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations.
     The Communist countries allocated more_than $ 1000000000 in economic aid alone last year , according to Western estimates.
   This was the biggest annual outlay since the Communist program for the under-developed countries made its modest beginning in 1954.
   In 1960 more_than 6000 Communist technicians were present in those countries.
     A committee of experts has recommended that a country 's population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the United_Nations.
   This was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the Soviet_Union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the United_Nations.
     One effect of the proposal , which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength , as in_the_past , would be to take jobs from European_nations and give more to such countries as India.
   India is the_most populous United_Nations member with more_than 400000000 inhabitants.
     The new formula for filling staff positions in the Secretariat is one of a_number_of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report.
   The report was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of the organization of the United_Nations.
     The Advisory_Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions is expected to receive the report this week.
   The jobs formula is understood to follow these lines :     Each of the organization 's ninety-nine members would get two professional posts , such_as political affairs officer , a department_head or an economist , to start.
     Each member would get one post for each 10000000 people in its population up_to 150000000 people or a maximum of fifteen posts.
     Each member with a population above 150000000 would get one additional post for each additional 30000000 people up_to an unspecified cut-off point.
     The three leaders of Laos agreed today to begin negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government that would unite the war-ridden kingdom.
     The decision was made in Zurich by Prince_Boun_Oum , Premier of the pro-Western royal Government ; Prince_Souvanna_Phouma , leader of the nation 's neutralists and recognized as Premier by the Communist bloc , and Prince_Souphanouvong , head of the pro-Communist Pathet_Lao forces.
   The latter two are half-brothers.
     Their joint statement was welcomed by the Western delegations who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth plenary session of the fourteen-nation conference on the future of Laos.
   An agreement among the Princes on a coalition government would ease their task , diplomats conceded.
   But no one was overly optimistic.
     W._Averell_Harriman of the United_States , Malcolm_MacDonald of Britain , Maurice_Couve de Murville , France 's Foreign_Minister , and Howard_C._Green , Canada 's Minister of External Affairs , concluded , meanwhile , a round of consultations here on future tactics in the conference.
   The pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week.
     Princess_Moune , Prince_Souvanna_Phouma 's young daughter , read the Princes ' statement.
   They had a two-hour luncheon together in  an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation  , she said.
     The three Laotians agreed upon a six-point agenda for their talks , which are to last three days.
     The Princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days.
     The meetings in Zurich , the statement said , would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition Government.
    
    Appointment of William_S._Pfaff_Jr. , 41 , as promotion manager of The Times-Picayune Publishing_Company was announced Saturday by John_F._Tims , president of the company.
     Pfaff succeeds Martin_Burke , who resigned.
     The new promotion manager has been employed by the company since January , 1946 , as a commercial_artist in the advertising_department.
     He is a native of New_Orleans and attended Allen Elementary_school , Fortier High_school and Soule business_college.
     From June , 1942 , until December , 1945 , Pfaff served in the Army Air_Corps.
   While in the service he attended radio school at Scott_Field in Belleville , Ill..
     Before entering the service , Pfaff for five years did clerical work with a general merchandising and wholesale firm in New_Orleans.
     He is married to the former Audrey_Knecht and has a daughter , Karol , 13.
   They reside at 4911 Miles_dr..
     Thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along Pennsylvania_Avenue between the Capitol and the White_House for the big inaugural parade on Jan. 20.
     Assuming the weather is halfway decent that day , hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as President_John_F._Kennedy and retiring President_Dwight_D._Eisenhower leave Capitol_Hill following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route.
     Pennsylvania_Avenue , named for one of the original 13 states , perhaps is not the_most impressive street in the District_of_Columbia from a commercial standpoint.
   But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it.
     Within view of the avenue are some of the United_States_government 's tremendous buildings , plus shrines and monuments.
   Of_course , 1600 Pennsylvania , the White_House , is the_most famous address of the free_world.
     Within an easy walk from Capitol_Hill where Pennsylvania_Avenue comes together with Constitution_Avenue , begins a series of great federal buildings , some a block long and all about seven-stories high.
     Great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue , now about 169 years old.
   In the early spring of 1913 a_few hundred_thousand persons turned_out to watch 5000 women parade.
   They were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote.
   In the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many_of them did vote for_the_first_time.
     Along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the War_Between_the_States returning in 1865 is the National Archives building where hundreds of thousands of_this country 's most valuable records are kept.
   Also the department_of_justice building is located where J._Edgar_Hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation.
     Street car tracks run down the center of Pennsylvania , powered with lines that are underground.
     Many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage_points bordering Lafayette_Square , opposite the White_House.
   In_this historic square are several statutes , but the one that stands_out over the others is that of Gen._Andrew_Jackson , hero of the Battle of New_Orleans.
     Moving past the presidential viewing stand and Lafayette_Square will be at_least 40 marching units.
   About 16000 military members of all branches of the armed_forces will take_part in the parade.
     Division one of the parade will be the service academies.
   Division two will include the representations of Massachusetts and Texas , the respective states of the President and of Vice-President_L._B._Johnson.
   Then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union.
     Division three will be headed by the Marines followed by 12 states ; division four will be headed by the Navy , followed by 11 states ; division five , by the Air_Force followed by 11 states.
   Division six will be headed by the Coast_Guard , followed by the reserve forces of all services , five states , Puerto_Rico , the_Virgin Islands , Guam , American_Samoa , the trust_territories and the Canal_Zone.
     What does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in Mississippi?
     Even for those who have been observing the political scene a long_time , no script from the past is worth very_much in gazing into the state 's immediate political future.
     This is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state_government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants - Gov._Ross_Barnett.
     Barnett , who came into office with no previous experience in_public administration , has surrounded himself with confusion which not_only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as_well.
     Consequently , it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the Barnett administration will take in the coming year.
     Some predict the administration will settle_down during 1961 and iron_out the rough edges which it has had thus_far.
     The builtin headache of the Barnett regime thus_far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and_others who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor 's office.
     There are many who predict that should Barnett decide to call the Legislature back into special session , it will really throw his administration into a scramble.
     Certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come_back together Barnett will be_able_to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful  honeymoon  he had in the 1960 legislative session.
     If Barnett does n't call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or special session.
     The odds favor a special session , more_than likely early in the year.
     Legislators always get restless for a special session ( whether for the companionship or the $ 22.50 per_diem is not certain ) and if they start agitating.
   Barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure.
     The issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly_sensitive problem of cutting the state 's congressional_districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat.
     With eyes focused_on the third congressional_district , the historic Delta district , and Congressman_Frank_E._Smith as the one most likely to go , the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the Delta have held in the Legislature.
     Mississippi 's relations with the national Democratic_party will be at a crossroads during 1961 , with the first Democratic president in eight years in the White_House.
     Split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents , the Democratic_party in Mississippi is currently a wreck.
   And there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together.
     Barnett , as the titular head of the Democratic_party , apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national Democratic_party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary.
     With a Democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity in the November election.
     Now , the picture is clouded , and even US Sens._James_O._Eastland and John_C._Stennis , who remained loyal to the ticket , are uncertain of their status.
     Reports are that it is more_than probability that the four congressmen from Mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen.
     The Gov._Jimmie_H._Davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 , with the governor 's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses.
     The year will probably start_out with segregation still the_most troublesome issue.
   But it might give_way shortly to another vexing issue - that of finances in state_government.
     The transition from segregation to finances might already be in_progress , in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales_tax from 2 per_cent to 3 per_cent.
     The administration has said the sales_tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program.
     But the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax_bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation.
     Indeed , the administration 's curious position on the sales_tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat.
   The administration could not say why $ 28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program.
     The effectiveness of the governor in clearing_up some of the inconsistencies revolving_about the sales_tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote.
     The tax_bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when the Legislature reconvenes.
     Davis may use the tax_bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature to normalcy.
     If it fails to pass , he can throw up his hands and say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration.
   He could terminate special sessions of the Legislature.
     Actually , Davis would have to toss_in_the_towel soon anyway.
   Many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token integration.
     This is not the sort_of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly.
   They would like to convey the notion something is being done , even_though it is something they know to be ineffectual.
     Passage of the sales_tax measure would also give Davis the means to effect a transition.
   He could tell the Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry_on the battle.
     Then he could tell them to go_home , while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $ 28 million in extra revenues the sales_tax measure would bring_in over an eight months period.
     It is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $ 28 million , since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one.
     But if the administration should find it does not need the $ 28 million for a grant-in-aid program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very_well seek a way to use the money for other purposes.
     This would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration - the shortage of cash.
   It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal_year.
     If the administration does not succeed in passing the sales_tax bill , or any other tax_bill , it could very_well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma.
     Since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax_bill at a fiscal session , the administration will either have to cut_down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues.
     In either case , it could call a special session of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser.
     The prospect of cutting_back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor.
   It is one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem.
     But if all alternatives should be clearly blocked_off , it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature.
     This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed_out by the trims to exert pressure on the Legislature , so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year.
     A constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize.
     Any tax_bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves.
     The new_year might see some house-cleaning , either genuine or token , depending_upon developments , to give Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms.
    
    City_Controller_Alexander_Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford_Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had  an inside track  with the city.
     Estimates of the city 's loss in the $ 344000 job have ranged as high as $ 200000.
     Hemphill said that the Hughes_Steel_Erection_Co. contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less_than the  legitimate  bids of competing contractors.
     The Hughes concern then took  shortcuts  on the project but got paid anyway , Hemphill said.
     The Controller 's charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures Tuesday :     The city has sued for the full amount of the $ 172400 performance_bond covering the contract.
     The Philadelphia_Transportation_Co. is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project.
     The signature of Harold_V._Varani , former director of architecture and engineering in the Department of Public_Property , appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project.
   Varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor.
     Managing_Director Donald_C._Wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with Hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the_matter.
     The announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance_bond was made by City_Solicitor_David_Berger at a press_conference following a meeting in the morning with Wagner and other officials of the city and the PTC as_well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled_off the El project before its completion in 1959.
     The Hughes company and the Consolidated Industries , Inc. , both of 3646 N. 2 d st. , filed for reorganization under the Federal bankruptcy law.
   On Monday , the Hughes concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw_up a plan for reorganization.
     Business_relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by Hemphill and District_Attorney James_C._Crumlish , Jr..
     The suit was filed later in the day in Common Pleas Court 7 against the Hughes company and two bonding firms.
   Travelers_Indemnity_Co. and the Continental_Casualty_Co..
     At Berger 's direction , the city also intervened in the Hughes bankruptcy case in U._S._District_Court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there.
      I am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated  , Berger said.
     The contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the El track.
   The contract called_for overhauling of 102 joints.
   The city paid for work on 75 , of_which no_more_than 21 were repaired , Hemphill charged.
     Hemphill said the Hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of $ 500 for each joint.
   The bid from A._Belanger and Sons of Cambridge , Mass. , which listed the same officers as Hughes , was $ 600 per joint.
     But , Hemphill added , bids from other contractors ranged from $ 2400 to $ 3100 per joint.
     Berger 's decision to sue for the full amount of the performance_bond was questioned by Wagner in the morning press_conference.
   Wagner said the city paid only $ 37500 to the Hughes company.
    We won n't know the full amount until we get a full report  , Wagner said.
      We can claim on the maximum amount of the bond  , Berger said.
     Wagner replied ,  Ca n't you just see the headline :   ' City Hooked for $ 172000  '?
     Berger insisted that  we know enough to sue for the full amount .
     Douglas_M._Pratt , president of the PTC , who attended the meeting , said the transit company is reviewing the work on the El.
      We want to find_out who knew about it  , Pratt said.
    Certain people must have known about it .
      The PTC is investigating the whole matter  , Pratt said.
     Samuel_D._Goodis , representing the Philadelphia_Hotel_Association , objected on Tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing_fees , saying that occupancy_rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent last year.
     Goodis voiced his objection before City_Council 's Finance_Committee.
     For hotels with 1000 rooms , the increased license fee would mean an expense of $ 5000 a year , Goodis said.
     His testimony came during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses , permits and city services.
   The new fees are expected to raise an additional $ 740000 in the remainder of 1961 and $ 2330000 more a year after_that.
     The ordinance would increase the fee for rooming_houses , hotels and multi-family dwellings to $ 5 a room.
   The cost of a license now is $ 2 , with an annual renewal fee of $ 1.
     Goodis said that single rooms account_for 95 percent of the accomodations in some hotels.
     The city expects the higher rooming_house , hotel and apartment house fees to bring_in an additional $ 457000 a year.
     The increase also was opposed by Leonard_Kaplan , spokesman for the Home Builders Association of Philadelphia , on behalf of association members who operate apartment houses.
     A proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from Councilwoman_Virginia_Knauer , who formerly raised pedigreed dogs.
   The ordinance would increase fees from $ 1 for males and $ 2 for females to a flat $ 5 a dog.
     Mrs._Knauer said she did not think dog owners should be penalized for the city 's services to animal care.
     In_reply , Deputy Police_Commissioner Howard_R._Leary said that the city spends more_than $ 115000 annually to license and regulate dogs but collects only $ 43000 in fees.
     He reported that the city 's contributions for animal care included $ 67000 to the Women 's S._P._C._A. ; $ 15000 to pay six policemen assigned as dog_catchers and $ 15000 to investigate dog_bites.
     City_Finance_Director_Richard_J._McConnell indorsed the higher fees , which , he said , had been under study for more_than a year.
   The city is not adequately compensated for the services covered by the fees , he said.
     The new fee schedule also was supported by Commissioner of Licenses and Inspections_Barnet_Lieberman and Health_Commissioner_Eugene_A._Gillis.
     Petitions asking for a jail term for Norristown attorney Julian_W._Barnard will be_presented to the Montgomery_County_Court_Friday , it was_disclosed Tuesday by Horace_A._Davenport , counsel for the widow of the man killed last Nov. 1 by Barnard 's hit-run car.
     The petitions will be_presented in open court to President_Judge_William_F._Dannehower , Davenport said.
     Barnard , who pleaded no defense to manslaughter and hit-run charges , was fined $ 500 by Judge_Warren_K._Hess , and placed on two years ' probation providing he does not drive during that time.
   He was caught driving the day after the sentence was pronounced and given a warning.
     Victim of the accident was Robert_Lee_Stansbery , 39.
   His widow started the circulation of petitions after Barnard was reprimanded for violating the probation.
     The City_Planning Commission on Tuesday approved agreements between two redevelopers and the Redevelopment_Authority for the purchase of land in the $ 300000000 Eastwick_Redevelopment_Area project.
     The commission also approved a novel plan that would eliminate traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project.
     One of the agreements calls_for the New_Eastwick_Corp. to purchase a 1311 acre tract for $ 12192865.
   The tract is bounded by Island_ave. , Dicks_ave. , 61 st st. , and Eastwick_ave..
     It is designated as Stage 1 Residential on the Redevelopment_Authority 's master_plan and will feature row_houses , garden apartments , four small parks , schools , churches , a shopping_center and several small clusters of stores.
     The corporation was formed by the Reynolds_Metal_Co. and the Samuel_A. and Henry_A._Berger firm , a Philadelphia builder , for work in the project.
     The second agreement permits the authority to sell a 520 - acre tract west of Stage 1 Residential to Philadelphia Builders Eastwick_Corp. , a firm composed of 10 Philadelphia area builders , which is interested in developing part of the project.
     The plan for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was developed by Dr._Constantinos_A._Doxiadis , former Minister of Reconstruction in Greece and a consulting planner for the New_Eastwick_Corp..
     The plan calls_for dividing the project into 16 sectors which would be barred to vehicular_traffic.
   It provides_for a series of landscaped walkways and a central esplanade that would eventually run through the center of the entire two-and-a-half-mile length of the project.
     The esplanade eliminates Grovers_ave. , which on original plans ran through the center of the development.
   The esplanade would feature pedestrian_bridges over roads in the project.
     The president of the Kansas_City local of the International_Association of Fire_Fighters was severly injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he left home for work.
     Battalion_Chief_Stanton_M._Gladden , 42 , the central figure in a representation dispute between the fire_fighters association and the teamsters union , suffered multiple fractures of both ankles.
   He was in Baptist_Memorial hospital.
     The battalion chief said he had just gotten_into his 1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway of his home so_that he could take his other car to work.
      I 'd just turned_on the ignition when there was a big flash and I was_lying on the driveway  , he said.
     Gladden 's wife and two of his sons , John , 17 , and Jim , 13 , were inside the house.
   The younger boy said the blast knocked him out_of_bed and against the wall.
     The explosion sent the hood of the car flying over the roof of the house.
   The left front wheel landed 100 feet away.
     Police laboratory technicians said the explosive_device , containing either TNT or nitroglycerine , was apparently placed under the left front wheel.
   It was first believed the bomb was rigged to the car 's starter.
     Gladden had been the target of threatening telephone_calls in recent months and reportedly received one last night.
     The fire_department here has been torn for months by dissension involving top personnel and the fight between the fire_fighters association and the teamsters union.
     Gladden has been an outspoken critic of the present city administration and led his union 's battle against the teamsters , which began organizing city firemen in 1959.
     The fire_fighters association here offered a $ 5000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible_for the bombing.
   A $ 500 reward was offered by the association 's local in Kansas_City , Kas..
     The association said it would post 24 hour guards at Gladden 's home and at those of James_Mining and Eugene_Shiflett.
   Mining is secretary-treasurer of the local and Shiflett is a member of its executive committee.
   Both have been active in the association.
     Turkish political_leaders bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front government with Gen._Cemal_Gursel as president.
     An agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive elections on Oct. 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political bargaining under the threat of an army coup d ' etat.
     By-passing the military junta which has ruled Turkey since the overthrow of Premier_Adnan_Menderes 17 months ago , the army general_staff , led by Gen._Cedvet_Sunay , had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national coalition government.
     The army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on Gen._Gursel as president.
   Gen._Gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months.
     The military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the Menderes regime now in prison would be pardoned.
     Party leaders came_out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its own.
    
    Vincent_G._Ierulli has been appointed temporary assistant district_attorney , it was announced Monday by Charles_E._Raymond , District_Attorney.
     Ierulli will replace Desmond_D._Connall who has been called to active military_service but is expected back on_the_job by March 31.
     Ierulli , 29 , has been practicing in Portland since November , 1959.
   He is a graduate of Portland_University and the Northwestern_College of Law.
   He is married and the father of three children.
     Helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically , E._M._Martin , assistant secretary_of_state for economic affairs told members of the World_Affairs_Council_Monday night.
     Martin , who has been in office in Washington , D._C. , for 13 months spoke at the council 's annual meeting at the Multnomah_Hotel.
   He told some 350 persons that the United_States ' challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways , following their own paths.
      We must persuade them to enjoy a way_of_life which , if_not identical , is congenial with ours  , he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind_of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty.
     Insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice , he said , was the biggest detriment to the Soviet_Union.
     He cited East_Germany where after 15 years of Soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in , and added ,  so_long as people rebel , we must_not give_up .
     Martin called_for patience on the part of Americans.
      The countries are trying to build in a decade the kind_of society we took a century to build  , he said.
     By leaving our doors open the United_States gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare , he said.
      We have no reason to fear failure , but we must be extraordinarily patient  , the assistant secretary said.
     Economically , Martin said , the United_States could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves.
   Private business is more effective than government aid , he explained , because individuals are able to work with the people themselves.
     The United_States must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country , at what he termed a  social cost .
     Martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country.
     The Portland school_board was asked Monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with Portland 's civil_defense more plans for the city 's schools in event of attack.
     But there seemed to be some difference_of_opinion as to how far the board should go , and whose advice it should follow.
     The board_members , after hearing the coordination plea from Mrs._Ralph_H._Molvar , 1409 SW_Maplecrest_Dr. , said they thought they had already been cooperating.
     Chairman_C._Richard_Mears pointed_out that perhaps this was not strictly a school_board problem , in_case of atomic attack , but that the board would cooperate so_far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go.
     Dr._Melvin_W._Barnes , superintendent , said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership , perhaps on the national level , to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would  be more fruitful  , and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district.
      Los_Angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in_case of disaster  , he said.
    Nobody really expects to evacuate.
   I think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in_which we would have some confidence in following.
     Mrs._Molvar , who kept reiterating her request that they  please take a stand  , said ,  We must have faith in somebody - on the local level , and it would n't be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children .
     Dr._Barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans , even for a high_school where there were lots_of cars  might not be realistic and would not work .
     Mrs._Molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in_keeping_with Jack_Lowe 's program.
   The board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so_far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting.
     It was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done , is_going_to_be done and what it thought should be done.

     Beaverton_School_District No. 48 board_members examined blueprints and specifications for two proposed junior_high_schools at a Monday night workshop session.
     A bond issue which would have provided some $ 3.5 million for construction of the two 900 - student schools was defeated by district voters in January.
     Last week the board , by a 4 to 3 vote , decided to ask voters whether they prefer the 6 - 3 - 3 ( junior_high_school ) system or the 8 - 4 system.
   Board_members indicated Monday night this would be done by an advisory poll to be taken_on Nov. 15 , the same date as a $ 581000 bond election for the construction of three new elementary_schools.

     A stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken Friday by delegates to the 29 th general council of the Assemblies of God , in session at the Memorial_Coliseum.
     The council revised , in an effort to strengthen , the denomination 's 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966.
     The changes , unanimously adopted , were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the Bible.
   The council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the Bible.
     At the adoption , the Rev._T._F._Zimmerman , general superintendent , commented ,  The Assemblies of God has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has , without compromise , stood_for the great truths of the Bible for which men in_the_past have been willing to give their lives .
     Many changes involved minor editing and clarification ; however , the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list.
     The first of 16 beliefs of the denomination , now reads :      The scriptures , both Old and New_Testament , are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation of God to man , the infallible , authoritative rule of faith and conduct .
     The third belief , in six points , emphasizes the Diety of the Lord Jesus_Christ , and :     emphasizes the_Virgin birth the sinless life of Christ His miracles His substitutionary work on the cross His bodily resurrection from the dead and His exaltation to the right_hand of God.
     Friday afternoon the Rev._T._F._Zimmerman was reelected for his second consecutive two-year term as general superintendent of Assemblies of God.
   His offices are in Springfield , Mo..
   Election came on the nominating ballot.
     Friday night the delegates heard the need for their forthcoming program ,  Breakthrough  scheduled to fill the churches for the next two years.
   In his opening address Wednesday the Rev._Mr._Zimmerman , urged the delegates to consider a 10 - year expansion program , with  Breakthrough  the theme for the first two years.
     The Rev._R._L._Brandt , national secretary of the home missions department , stressed the need for the first two years ' work.
      Surveys show that one out of three Americans has vital contact with the church.
   This means that more_than 100 million have no vital touch with the church or religious life  , he told delegates Friday.
     Talking of the rapid population growth ( upwards of 12000 babies born daily ) with an immigrant entering the United_States every 1 - 1 2 minutes , he said  our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge .
      In 35 years we have opened 7000 churches  , the Rev._Mr._Brandt said , adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10000 persons.
      In_this light we need 1000 churches in Illinois , where we have 200 ; 800 in Southern New_England , we have 60 ; we need 100 in Rhode_Island , we have none  , he said.
     To step_up the denomination 's program , the Rev._Mr._Brandt suggested the vision of 8000 new Assemblies of God churches in the next 10 years.
     To accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods , he said.
      The church 's ability to change her methods is going_to determine her ability to meet the challenge of_this hour .
     A capsule view of proposed plans includes :     Encouraging by every means , all existing Assemblies of God churches to start new churches.

     U._S. Dist. Judge_Charles_L._Powell denied all motions made by defense_attorneys Monday in Portland 's insurance fraud trial.
     Denials were of motions of dismissal , continuance , mistrial , separate trial , acquittal , striking of testimony and directed_verdict.
     In denying motions for dismissal , Judge_Powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that  a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all_of the conspirators are .
     Attorney_Dwight_L._Schwab , in behalf of defendant Philip_Weinstein , argued there is no evidence linking Weinstein to the conspiracy , but Judge_Powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide.
     Schwab also declared there is no proof of Weinstein 's entering a conspiracy to use the U._S. mails to defraud , to_which federal prosecutor A._Lawrence_Burbank replied :      It is not necessary that a defendant actually have conspired to use the U._S. mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy , and the mails were then used to carry it out .
     In the afternoon , defense_attorneys began the presentation of their cases with opening statements , some of_which had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and presented its case.

    For_instance , Djakarta , Indonesia , has three groups of dancers interested in coming here.
   I 'm even going to try to get the whirling_dervishes of Damascus !
     The last obstacle in Mrs._Geraghty 's globe-girdling trip was smoothed_out when a representative of Syria called_upon her to explain that his brother would meet her at the border of_that country - so newly separated from Egypt and the United_Arab_Republic that she had n't been able to obtain a visa.
     Honolulu will be Mrs._Geraghty 's first stop.
   Then Japan , Hong_Kong , Manila , India , Pakistan , Damascus , Beirut , and to Rome , London , and Paris  to look over wonderful talent .
     Dec. 22 is the deadline for Mrs._Geraghty 's return ; the Geraghtys ' youngest daughter , Molly , bows in the Passavant_Debutante_Cotillion the next night.

     Those qualities make Esther_Marr a popular asset at the Salvation_Army 's Social_Center at 1200 Larimer_st..
     The pert , gray-haired woman who came to Denver three years ago from Buffalo , N._Y. , is a  civilian  with the Army.
     Her position covers a_number_of daily tasks common to any social director.
   The job also covers a_number_of other items.
      Mom  Marr , as the more_than 80 men at the center call her , is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society.
     Her day starts early , but no_matter_how many pressing letters there are to be written ( and during May , which is National Salvation_Army Week , there are plenty ) , schedules to be made or problems to be solved , Mrs._Marr 's office is always open and the welcome_mat is out.
     MRS._Marr is the first contact a Skid_Row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up.
     She sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures.
      Usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men  , Mrs._Marr explained.
     The Denverite has worked_out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center.
      And I bum tickets to everything I can  , she said.
    I 've become the greatest beggar in the world .
     In_addition to the tickets to the movies , sporting events and concerts , Mrs._Marr lines_up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a_lot_of sweets to replace the sugar in their system.
     Mrs._Marr also has a_number_of parolees to  mother  , watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society.
     By mid-June , millions of Americans will take to the road on vacation trips up and down and back_and_forth across this vast and lovely land.
     In another four weeks , with schools closed across_the_nation , the great all-American summer safari will be under_way.
   By July_1 , six weeks from now , motel-keepers all_over the nation will , by 6 p. m. , be switching_on that bleak - to motorists - sign ,  No Vacancy .
     No_matter_how many Americans go abroad in summer , probably a_hundred_times as_many gas_up the family car , throw suitcases , kids and comic_books in_the_back seat , and head for home.
   And where is  home  , that magic place of the heart?
     Ah , that is simple.
   Home is where a man was_born , reared , went_to school and , most particularly , where grandma is.
   That is where we turn in the good old summertime.
     The land lies ready for the coming onslaught.
   My husband and I , a month ahead of the rush , have just finished a 7 - day motor journey of 2809 miles from Tucson , Ariz. , to New_York_City.
     I can testify that motels , service and comfort_stations ( they go together like Scots and heather ) , dog wagons , roadside restaurants , souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting.
     I hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene , such an excellent network of roads on_which to enjoy it and such decent , far-flung over-night accommodations.
     Maybe motel-keeping is n't the nation 's biggest industry , but it certainly looks that way from the highway.
     There are motels for all purposes and all tastes.
   There are even motels for local weather peculiarities , as I discovered in Shamrock , Tex..
   There the Royal_Motel advertises  all facilities , vented heat , air conditioned , carpeted , free TV , storm_cellar .
     Innumerable motels from Tucson to New_York boast swimming_pools (  swim at your own risk  is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools ).
   Some even boast two pools , one for adults and one for children.
   But the Royal_Motel in Shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm_cellar.
     Motorists like myself who can remember the old  tourists accommodated  signs on farm houses and village homes before World_War 2 , can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business.
     At the Boxwood_Motel in Winchester , Va. , we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite , an elegant affair with wall-to-wall carpeting , gold and white furniture , pink satin brocade chairs , 24 - inch TV and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels.
   All for $ 14.
     That made_up for the  best  motel in Norman , Okla. , where the proprietor knocked $ 2 off the $ 8.50 tab when we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture.

     A Night in New_Orleans  is the gayety planned by members of the Thrift_Shop_Committee for May 6 at Philmont Country_Club.
   The women have a reputation for giving parties that are different and are fun and this year 's promises to follow in_this fine tradition.
   Mrs._H._J._Grinsfelder is chairman.
     The Louisiana city is known , of_course , for its fine food , good music and its colorful hospitality  and , when guests arrive_at Philmont that night  , says Mrs._Grinsfelder ,  that is exactly what we expect to offer them.
   We 've been working for weeks.
   The prospects look great.
   We are keeping a_number_of surprises under our hats.
   But we can n't tell it all now_and_then have no new excitement later .
     But she does indicate festivities will start early , that a jazz combo will  give with the Basin_Street beat  during the cocktail and dinner hours and that Lester_Lanin 's orchestra will take_over during the dancing.
     As for food , Mrs._Henry_Louchheim , chairman of_this phase , is a globetrotter who knows good food.
    New_Orleans ?
 she says ,  of_course I 've had the best.
   It is just bad_luck that we are having the party in a month with no R 's , so no oysters.
   But we have lots_of other New_Orleans specialties.
   I know they will be good.
   We 've tried them out on the club chef - or say , he has tried them out on us and we have selected the best .
     Guests will be treated to Gulf_Coast scenic effects.
   There will be masses of flowers , reproductions of the handsome old buildings with their grillwork and other things that are typical of New_Orleans.
   Mrs._Harry_K._Cohen is chairman of_this phase and she is getting an artistic assist from A._Van_Hollander , display director of Gimbel Brothers.
     The gala is the Thrift_Shop 's annual bundle party and , as all Thrift_Shop friends know , that means the admission is a bundle of used clothing in good_condition , contributions of household equipment , bric-a-brac and such to stock the shelves at the shop 's headquarters at 1213 Walnut_St..
     For the convenience of guests bundle centers have been established throughout the city and suburbs where the donations may be deposited between now and the date of the big event.
   In_addition to the bundles , guests pay the cost of their dinners.
   Members of the young set who would like to come to the party only during the dancing time are welcomed.
     The Thrift_Shop , with Mrs._Bernhard_S._Blumenthal as president , is one of the city 's most successful fund-raisers for the Federation of Jewish Agencies.
   Some idea of the competence of the women is indicated in the contribution made by them during the past 25 years that totals $ 840000.
      Big business , this little Thrift_Shop business  , say the members.

    The Baltimore and Ohio_Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per_cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12.01 A._M. next Saturday.
   The current monthly payroll comes to about $ 15000000.
     Howard_E._Simpson , the railroad 's president , said ,  A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action .
     The reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in_which the B. + O. operates.
     It will be accomplished in_two_ways :     A flat reduction of 10 per_cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging_to unions.
   There are about 3325 officers and employees in_this class.
     Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring_about a 10 per_cent cut in the union payroll expense.
     Since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union_members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a B. + O. spokesman said.
     Those union_members kept on their jobs , therefore , will not take a cut in their wages.
     The spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried_out in each area depending_on what men are most needed on_the_job.
     A thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of $ 18 at Franklin and Mount streets.
     The victim , Norman_B._Wiley , 38 , of the 900 block North_Charles street , was treated for cuts at Franklin_Square_Hospital after the robbery.
     The driver told police he followed as the Negro man got_out of the cab with his money.
   The victim was beaten when he attempted to stop the bandit.
     He said the assailant , who was armed with a.
45 - caliber automatic , entered the taxi at Pennsylvania avenue and Gold street.
     In another attack , Samuel_Verstandig , 41 , proprietor of a food store in the 2100 block Aiken street , told police two Negroes assaulted him in his store and stole $ 150 from the cash_register after choking and beating him.
     A baby was burned to death and two other children were seriously injured last night in a fire which damaged their one-room Anne_Arundel county home.
     The victim Darnell_Somerville , Negro , 1 , was pronounced dead on arrival at Anne_Arundel_General_Hospital in Annapolis.
     His sister and brother , Marie_Louise , 3 , and John_Raymond , Jr. 22 months , were admitted to the hospital.
   The girl was in critical condition with burns over 90 per_cent of her body.
     The boy received second-degree_burns of the face , neck and back.
   His condition was reported to be fair.
     Police said the children 's mother , Mrs._Eleanor_Somerville , was visiting next_door when the fire occurred.
     The house is on Old_Annapolis road a mile south of Severna_Park , at Jones_Station , police said.
     The Anne_Arundel county school_superintendent has asked that the Board_of_Education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so_that there will be no_more question about who said what.
     The proposal was made by Dr._David_S._Jenkins after he and Mrs._D._Ellwood_Williams , Jr. , a board_member and long-time critic of the superintendent , argued for about fifteen minutes at this week 's meeting.
     The disagreement was over what Dr._Jenkins had said at a previous session and_how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting.
     Mrs._Williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of Dr._Jenkins 's conversation and_how they were written up for the board 's approval.
      I hate to have these things come_up again_and_again  , Dr._Jenkins commented as he made his suggestion.
    These are the board 's minutes.
   I 'll write what you tell me to .
     For a_number_of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago.
     It was about that time , a board_member said later , that Dr._Thomas_G._Pullen , Jr. , State superintendent of schools , told Dr._Jenkins and a_number_of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording_machine sitting in_front of him.
     The Board of County Commissioners , the Sanitary_Commission , the Planning and Zoning_Board and other county official bodies use recording_machines for all public business in_order_to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings.
     Dr._Jenkins notes , however , that most_of the school_boards in the State do not do so.
     State_Senator Joseph_A._Bertorelli ( D. , First_Baltimore ) had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block of West_Pratt street.
     He was taken to University_Hospital in a municipal ambulance.
     Doctors at the hospital said he was partially paralyzed on_the_right side.
   His condition was said to be ,  fair .
     Police said he became ill while parked in_front of a barber shop at 229 West_Pratt street.
     He called Vincent_L._Piraro , proprietor of the shop , who summoned police and an ambulance.
     The vice_president of the City_Council complained yesterday that there are  deficiencies  in the city 's snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible.
     Councilman_William_D._Schaefer ( D. , Fifth ) said in a letter to Mayor_Grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month.
     Conceding that several cities to_the_north were in worse shape than Baltimore after the last storm , Mr._Schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here.
     He said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in December.
   Equipment should be in_operation  almost immediately after the first snowfall  , Mr._Schaefer said.
     The Councilman , who is the Administration floor_leader , also criticized Bernard_L._Werner , public_works director , for  halting snow operations  on Tuesday night after the Sunday storm.
     Mr._Werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week.
   What he did , Mr._Werner said , was let manual_laborers go_home Tuesday night for some rest.
   Work resumed Wednesday , he said.
     Mr._Schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan , under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow_tires or chains on them , should be  strictly enforced .
     Admitting that main_streets and the central business_district should have priority , the Councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas  not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive .
     Recounting personal observations of clearance work , the Councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes.
     The 15 - year-old adopted son of a Washington attorney and his wife , who were murdered early today in their Chesapeake Bay-front home , has been sent to Spring_Grove_State_Hospital for detention.
     The victims were H._Malone_Dresbach , 47 , and his wife , Shirley , 46.
   Each had been shot in_the_back several_times with a.
22 - caliber automatic_rifle , according to Capt._Elmer_Hagner , chief of Anne_Arundel detectives.
     Judge_Benjamin_Michaelson signed the order remanding the boy to the hospital because of the lack of juvenile accommodations at the Anne_Arundel_County_Jail.
   The Circuit_Court jurist said the boy will have a hearing in Juvenile_Court.
     Soon after 10 A._M. , when police reached the 1 - 1 2 - story brick home in the Franklin_Manor section , 15 miles south of here on the bay , in response to a call from the Dresbach 's other son , Lee , 14 , they found Mrs._Dresbach 's body on the first-floor bedroom floor.
   Her husband was lying on the kitchen floor , police said.
     The younger son told police his brother had run from the house after the shootings and had driven away in their mother 's car.
     The description of the car was immediately broadcast throughout Southern_Maryland on police radio.
     Police said the boys are natural brothers and were adopted as small children by the Dresbachs.
     Trooper_J._A._Grzesiak spotted the wanted car , with three boys , at a Route 2 service_station , just outside Annapolis.
   The driver admitted he was the Dresbachs ' son and all three were taken to the Edgewater_Station , police said.
     Governor_Tawes today appointed Lloyd_L._Simpkins , his administrative assistant , as Maryland 's Secretary_of_State.
     Mr._Simpkins will move_into the post being vacated by Thomas_B._Finan , earlier named attorney_general to succeed C._Ferdinand_Sybert , who will be elevated to an associate judgeship on the Maryland Court_of_Appeals.
     Governor_Tawes announced that a triple swearing-in ceremony will be held in his office next Friday.
     Mr._Simpkins is a resident of Somerset county , and he and the Governor , also a Somerset countian , have been friends since Mr._Simpkins was a child.
     Now 38 , Mr._Simpkins was graduated from the University of Maryland 's College of Agriculture in 1947.
     Five years later , he was awarded the university 's degree in law.
     Mr._Simpkins made a name for himself as a member of the House of Delegates from 1951 through 1958.
   From the outset of his first term , he established himself as one of the guiding spirits of the House of Delegates.
     Maryland contracts for future construction during October totaled $ 77389000 , up_to 10 per_cent compared to October , 1960 , F._W._Dodge , Dodge_Corporation , reported.
     Dodge reported the following breakdown :     Nonresidential at $ 20447000 , down 28 per_cent ; residential at $ 47101000 , up 100 per_cent ; and heavy engineering at $ 9841000 , down 45 per_cent.
     The cumulative total of construction contracts for the first ten months of 1961 amounted to $ 634517000 , a 4 per_cent increase compared to the corresponding period of last year.
     A breakdown of the ten-month total showed :     Nonresidential at $ 253355000 , up 22 per_cent ; residential at $ 278877000 , up 12 per_cent ; and heavy engineering at $ 102285000 , down 33 per_cent.
     Residential building consists_of houses , apartments , hotels , dormitories and other buildings designed for shelter.
     The share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments , which began about six years ago , has more_than tripled within that span of time.
     In 1961 , it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account_for nearly 30 per_cent of the starts in residential construction.
     While availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction , the generally high level of prosperity in_the_past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartment-building field.
     Although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those now choosing apartments , Leo_J._Pantas , vice_president of a hardware manufacturing company , pointed_out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common : a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house.
      Convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today.
   Trouble-free , long-life , quality components will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960  , Pantas predicted.
     Sixty-seven living units are being added to the 165 - unit Harbor_View_Apartments in the Cherry_Hill section.
     Ultimately the development will comprise 300 units , in two-story and three-story structures.
   Various of the apartments are of the terrace type , being on the ground_floor so_that entrance is direct.
   Others , which are reached by walking up a single flight_of_stairs , have balconies.
     The structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction.
   Heating is by individual gas-fired , forced warm air systems.
     Construction in 1962 will account_for about 15 per_cent of the gross_national_product , according to a study by Johns-Manville_Corporation.
    
    Vital secrets of Britain 's first atomic submarine , the Dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire United_States navy 's still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring , secret_service agents testified today.
     The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United_States in 1959 and was launched last year.
   It is a killer sub - that_is , a hunter of enemy subs.
   It has a hull patterned on_that of the United_States navy 's Nautilus , the world 's first atomic submarine.
   Its power_unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack.
     The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow_st. police_court here at the end of a three day hearing.
   A full trial was ordered for :     Two British civil_servants , Miss_Ethel Gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , Harry_Houghton , 55 , and divorced.
   They are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept_guard.
     Gordon_A._Lonsdale , 37 , a mystery man presumed to be Russian altho he carries a Canadian passport.
   When arrested , he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid_camera film as_well as anti-submarine secrets in Christmas_gift wrapping , it was testified.
     A shadowy couple who call themselves Peter_Kroger , bookseller , and wife , Joyce.
     [ In Washington , the Federal_Bureau of Investigation identified the Krogers as Morris and Lola_Cohen , an American couple formerly of New_York_City.
 ]     In their suburban cottage the crown charges , the Krogers received secrets from the mystery man , usually on the first Saturday evening of each_month , and spent much of the week-end getting the secrets off to Moscow , either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books.
   Each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing , a printed page , or a manuscript.
     All five pleaded innocent.
   Only Miss Gee asked for bail.
   Her young British lawyer , James_Dunlop , pleaded that she was sorely needed at her Portland home by her widowed mother , 80 , her maiden_aunt , also 80 and bedridden for 20 years , and her uncle , 76 , who once ran a candy shop.
      I am not prepared to grant bail to any of them  , said the magistrate , K._J._P._Baraclough.
     The trial will be held , probably the first week of March , in the famous Old_Bailey central criminal_court where Klaus_Fuchs , the naturalized British German born scientist who succeeded in giving American and British atomic_bomb secrets to Russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950 s , was sentenced to 14 years in prison.
     Fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five , who may have altered history in the 1960 s.
   Fuchs , after nine and a half years , was released , being given time_off for_good behavior.
   He promptly went_to communist East_Germany.
     The magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $ 29000 in American and British currency , mostly $ 20 bills , and in British government bonds and stocks.
      This is Russian money  , said Mervin_Griffith-Jones for the attorney_general 's office.
   He asserted that the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow , Lonsdale the Red paymaster , and the two civil_servants the recipients for selling their country 's secrets.
     The fact that secrets of the Dreadnought , and thereby of the American undersea fleet , were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier.
     But just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the_British navy 's chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare , Capt._George_Symonds.
   He said that drawings of the Dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from Lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil_servants outside the Old_Vic theater Saturday afternoon , Jan. 7.
     The information , he said , would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy.
     Just how many sub secrets were being handed_over when the ring , watched for six months , was broken remained untold.
     The_British defending lawyers , who today increased from three to four , demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury , the chances of their clients would improve.
   So in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour.
     Almost any information about the Dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the American underwater fleet.
   Britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the American government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with Britain that had been imposed after Fuchs blabbed.
   The United_States offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the Skipjack.
     With the machinery went a complete design for the hull.
     The Skipjack was a second generation atomic sub , much advanced on the Nautilus and the other four which preceded it.
      Much of the navy 's future depends_upon her  , an American naval announcement said on the Skipjack 's first arrival in British waters in August , 1959 , for exhibition to selected high officers at Portland underwater research station.
   It was there that the two accused civil_servants were at_work.
      Her basic hull form [ a teardrop ] and her nuclear_power plant will be used for almost all new submarines , including the potent Polaris missile submarines  , the statement went_on.
     The atom reactor , water cooled , was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic_energy commission and Westinghouse_Electric_Corp..
   Thru development , the reactor and its steam_turbines had been reduced greatly in size , and also in complexity , allowing a single propeller to be used , the navy said.
     The hull was also a result of almost a decade of work.
   It was first tried_out on a conventional submarine , the Albacore , in 1954.
     The Skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built.
   Reputedly it could outrun , underwater , the fastest destroyers.
   It could , reputedly , go 70000 miles without refueling and stay down more_than a month.
     It was of the hunter-killer type , designed to seek_out ships and other submarines with its most advance gear and destroy them with torpedoes.
     The navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in Miss Gee 's purse would , if completed and handed back , have given the Kremlin a complete picture  of our current anti-submarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future .
     The spy ring also was particularly interested in ASDIC , the underwater equipment for detecting submarines , it was testified.
   Range was a vital detail.
   Designs of parts were sought.
     Six radiomen told how , twice on two days after the ring was nabbed , a transmitter near Moscow was heard calling , using signals , times and wavelengths specified on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in Lonsdale 's apartment and the Krogers ' house and also fastened to the transmitter lid.
   Oddly , the calls were still heard 11 days after the five were arrested.
     The charge that the federal indictment of three Chicago narcotics detail detectives  is the product of rumor , combined with malice , and individual enmity  on the part of the federal narcotics unit here was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before Judge_Joseph_Sam_Perry in federal_District court.
     The three - Miles_J._Cooperman , Sheldon_Teller , and Richard_Austin - and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws.
     In his opening statement to a jury of eight women and four men , Bernard_H._Sokol , attorney for the detectives , said that evidence would show that his clients were  entirely innocent .
      When they became members of the city police narcotics unit  , Sokol said ,  they were told they would have to get to know certain areas of Chicago in_which narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in the narcotics racket.
   They , on_occasion , posed as addicts and peddlers .
     Altho federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together , Sokol continued , rivalries developed when they were  aiming at the same criminals .
   This , he added , brought_about  petty jealousies  and  petty personal grievances .
      In the same five year period that the United_States says they [ the detectives ] were engaged in this conspiracy  , Sokol continued ,  these three young_men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations , and were nominated for the Lambert_Tree award and the mayor 's medal .
     In opening , D._Arthur_Connelly , assistant United_States attorney , read the indictment , but made no comments.
   Attorneys for the eight other defendants said only that there was no proof of their clients ' guilt.
     Cooperman and Teller are accused of selling $ 4700 worth of heroin to a convicted narcotics peddler , Otis_Sears , 45 , of 6934 Indiana av..
   Among other acts , Teller and Austin are accused of paying $ 800 to Sears.
     The first witness , Moses_Winston_Mardis , 5835 Michigan av. , a real_estate_agent and former bail bondsman , took_the_stand after opening statements had been made.
   But court adjourned after he testified he introduced James_White and Jeremiah_Hope_Pullings , two of the defendants , and also introduced Pullings to Jessy_Maroy , a man mentioned in the indictment but not indicted.
     Buaford_Robinson , 23 , of 7026 Stewart av. , a CTA bus_driver , was slugged and robbed last night by a group of youths at 51 st street and South_Park way.
   Robinson was treated at a physician 's office for a cut over his left eyebrow and a possible sprained knee.
   His losses included his money bag , containing $ 40 to $ 50 and his $ 214 paycheck.
     Robinson told Policemen James_Jones and Morgan_Lloyd of the Wabash avenue district that 10 youths boarded his south bound express_bus in_front of Dunbar_Vocational High_school , 30 th street and South_Park way , and began  skylarking .
     When 51 st street was reached , Robinson related , he stopped the bus and told the youths he was going to call the CTA supervisor.
   As he left the bus with his money bag , Robinson added , the largest youth accosted him , a quarrel ensued , and the youth knocked him down.
   Then the youths fled with his money.
     Mrs._Blanche_Dunkel , 60 , who has spent 25 years in the Dwight reformatory for women for the murder in 1935 of her son-in-law , Ervin_Lang , then 28 , appealed for a parole at a hearing yesterday before two Illinois pardon and parole board_members , John_M._Bookwalter and Joseph_Carpentier.
   She had been sentenced to 180 years in prison , but former Gov._Stratton commuted her term to 75 years , making her eligible for parole , as one of his last acts in office.
     Mrs._Dunkel admitted the slaying and said that the son-in-law became her lover after the death of her daughter in 1934.
   It was when he attempted to end the relationship that the murder took_place.
     The son of a wealthy Evanston executive was fined $ 100 yesterday and forbidden to drive for 60 days for leading an Evanston policeman on a high speed chase over icy Evanston and Wilmette streets Jan. 20.
     The defendant , William_L._Stickney 3 , 23 , of 3211 Park_pl. , Evanston , who pleaded guilty to reckless driving , also was ordered by Judge_James_Corcoran to attend the Evanston traffic school each Tuesday night for one month.
     Stickney is a salesman for Plee-Zing , Inc. , 2544 Green_Bay rd. , Evanston , a food brokerage and grocery chain firm , of_which his father , William_L._Jr. , is president.
     Patrolman_James_F._Simms said he started in pursuit when he saw young Stickney speeding north in Stewart avenue at Central street.
     At Jenks street , Simms said , the car skidded completely around , just missed two parked cars , and sped east in Jenks.
     The car spun around again , Simms said , before Stickney could turn north in Prairie avenue , and_then violated two stop lights as he traveled north into Wilmette in Prairie.
    
    A jury of seven men and five women found 21 - year-old Richard_Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs._Anna_Hengesbach.
     Pohl received the verdict without visible emotion.
   He returned to his cell in the county jail , where he has been held since his arrest last July , without a word to his court-appointed attorney , Jack_Walker , or his guard.
     The verdict brought vindication to the dead woman 's stepson , Vincent_Hengesbach , 54 , who was tried for the same crime in December , 1958 , and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict.
   Mrs._Hengesbach was killed on Aug. 31 , 1958.
     Hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since.
   When the verdict came_in against his young neighbor , Hengesbach said :      I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed.
   Still , I do n't wish to appear happy at somebody 's else 's misfortune .
     Hengesbach , who has been living_on welfare recently , said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled by his grandfather in Westphalia , 27 miles southwest of here.
     Hengesbach has been living in Grand Ledge since his house and barn were burned_down after his release in 1958.
     Pohl confessed the arson while being questioned about several fires in the Westphalia area by State_Police.
     He also admitted killing Mrs._Hengesbach.
   However , the confession , which was the only evidence against him , was retracted before the trial.
     Assistant_Prosecutor_Fred_Lewis , who tried both the Hengesbach and Pohl cases , said he did not know what would be done about two arson charges pending against Pohl.
     Circuit_Judge_Paul_R._Cash did not set a date for sentencing.
   Pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in prison or probation.
     Walker said he was considering filing a motion for a new trial which would contend that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that there were several errors in trial procedure.
     A verdict against Pohl came at 4 : 05 p. m. after almost 13 - 1 2 hours of deliberation.
   The jury , which was locked_up in a motel overnight , was canvassed at the request of Walker after the verdict was announced.
     The jury foreman , Mrs._Olive_Heideman , of rural Elsie , said that a ballot was not even taken until yesterday morning and that the first day of deliberation was spent in going_over the evidence.
     She said the jurors agreed that Pohl 's confession was valid.
     The jury asked Judge_Cash to send in his written definition of the difference between first and second-degree murder and manslaughter.
     The verdict came three hours later.
     Some 30 spectators remained in the court during the day and were to hear the verdict read.
   The trial had packed the large courtroom for more_than a week.
     A Sterling_Township family of six surviving children , whose mother died yesterday as the aftermath to a fire that also killed one of the children , found today they had the help of hundreds of neighbors and school friends.
     While neighbor women assumed some of the dead mother 's duties , fund-raising events were being planned by a homeowners association and a student council for the hard-hit Henry_Kowalski family , 34220 Viceroy.
     Mrs._Eleanor_Kowalski , 42 , died yesterday afternoon in Holy_Cross_Hospital of burns suffered in a fire that followed a bottled_gas explosion Saturday night at the flat of her widowed mother , Mrs._Mary_Pankowski , in the adjoining suburb of Warren.
     Funeral services for Mrs._Kowalski and her daughter , Christine , 11 , who died of burns at the same hospital Monday , have been scheduled for 10 a. m. tomorrow in St._Anne 's Catholic_Church , 31978 Mound , in Warren.
     The mother and daughter , who will be buried side_by_side in Mt._Olivet_Cemetery , rested together today in closed caskets at the Lyle_Elliott Funeral_Home , 31730 Mound , Warren.
     Mrs._Pankowski , 61 , remained in Holy_Cross_Hospital as a result of the explosion , which occurred while Mrs._Kowalski fueled a cook stove in the grandmother 's small upstairs flat at 2274 Eight Mile road east.
     Assistant Fire_Chief Chester_Cornell said gas fumes apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the three Kowalski girls present held for her mother , because the flat lacked electricity.
     Christine 's twin sister , Patricia , and Darlene_Kowalski , 8 , escaped with minor burns.
   They are home now with the other Kowalski children , Vicky , 14 ; Dennis , 6 ; Eleanor , 2 ; and Bernardine , 1.
      All we have left in the world is one another , and we must stay_together the way Mother wanted  , Kowalski said in telling his children of their mother 's death yesterday afternoon.
     Kowalski , a roofer who seldom worked last winter , already was in_arrears on their recently purchased split-level home when the tragedy staggered him with medical and funeral bills.
     Neighbor women , such_as Mrs._Sidney_Baker , 2269 Serra , Sterling_Township , have been supplying the family with meals and handling household chores with Kowalski 's sister-in-law , Mrs._Anna_Kowalski , 22111 David , East_Detroit.
     Another neighbor , Mrs._Frank_C._Smith , 2731 Pall_Mall , Sterling_Township , surprised Kowalski by coming to the home yesterday with $ 135 collected locally toward the $ 400 funeral costs.
     John_C._Houghton , president of the Tareytown_Acres_Homeowners_Association , followed that by announcing plans last night for a door-to-door fund drive throughout their subdivision on behalf of the Kowalski family.
     Houghton said 6 p. m._Friday had been set for a canvass of all 480 homes in the subdivision , which is located northeast of Dequindre and 14 Mile road east.
   He said contributions also could be mailed to Post_Office Box 553 , Warren_Village_Station.
     Vicky_Kowalski meanwhile learned that several of her fellow students had collected almost $ 25 for her family during the lunch hour yesterday at Fuhrmann Junior_High_School , 5155 Fourteen Mile road east.
     Principal_Clayton_W._Pohly said he would allow a further collection between classes today , and revealed that Y-Teen_Club past surpluses had been used to provide a private hospital nurse Monday for Mrs._Kowalski.
     Student_Council officers announced today the Kowalski family would be given the combined proceeds from a school dance held two_weeks ago , and another dance for Fuhrmann 's 770 students this Friday night.
      Furhmann 's faculty is proud that this has been a spontaneous effort , started largely among the students themselves , because of fondness for Vicky and sympathy for her entire family , Pohly said.
     There also were reports of a collection at the County_Line Elementary_School , 3505 o Dequindre , which has been attended this year by four of the Kowalski children including Christine.
     Kowalski has spoken but little since the fire last Saturday.
   But today he wanted to make a public statement.
      I never knew there were such neighbors and friends around me and my family.
   I was n't sure there were such people anywhere in the world.
   I 'll need more_than a single day to find the words to properly express my thanks to them .
     An alert 10 - year-old safety patrol boy was congratulated by police today for his part in obtaining a reckless driving conviction against a youthful motorist.
     Patrolman_George_Kimmell , of McClellan_Station , said he would recommend a special safety citation for Ralph_Sisk , 9230 Vernor east , a third grader at the Scripps_School , for his assistance in the case.
     Kimmell said he and Ralph were helping children across Belvidere at Kercheval_Monday afternoon when a car heading north on Belvidere stopped belatedly inside the pedestrian crosswalk.
     Kimmell ordered the driver to back_up , watched the children safely across and was approaching the car when it suddenly  took_off at high speed  , he said , narrowly missing him.
     Commandeering a passing car , Kimmell pursued the fleeing vehicle , but lost it in traffic.
   Returning to the school_crossing , the officer was informed by the Sisk boy that he recognized the driver , a neighbor , and had obtained the license_number.
     The motorist later was identified as Richard_Sarkees , 17 , of 2433 McClellan , currently on probation and under court order not to drive.
     He was found guilty of reckless driving yesterday by Traffic_Judge_George_T._Murphy , who continued his no-driving probation for another year and ordered him to spend 15 days in the Detroit House_of_Correction.
   The jail sentence is to begin the day after Sarkees graduates from Eastern High_School in June.
     The long crisis in Laos appeared nearing a showdown today.
     Britain announced that it is asking the Soviet_Union to agree tomorrow to an immediate cease-fire.
     In Vientiane , the royal Laotian government decided today to ask its  friends and neighbors  for help in fighting what it called a new rebel offensive threatening the southeast Asian kingdom.
     Britain 's plans to press Russia for a definite cease-fire timetable was announced in London by Foreign_Secretary_Lord_Home.
     He said Britain also proposed that the international truce commission should be reconvened , sent to New_Delhi and from there to Laos to verify the cease-fire.
     A 14 - power conference on Laos should then meet on May 5 , he said.
     The Laos government plea for help was made by Foreign_Minister Tiao_Sopsaisana.
   He indicated that requests would be made_for more U._S. arms and more U._S. military advisers.
     He declared the government is thinking_of asking for foreign troops if the situation worsens.
     One of the first moves made after a cabinet decision was to request the United_States to establish a full-fledged military assistance group instead of the current civilian body.
     A note making the request was handed to U._S._Ambassador_Winthrop_G._Brown.
     The Laos government said four major Pathet_Lao rebel attacks had been launched , heavily supported by troops from Communist_North Viet_Nam.
     The minister , describing the attacks which led_up to the appeal , said that 60000 Communist_North Vietnamese were fighting royal army troops on one front - near Thakhek , in southern-central Laos.
     There was no confirmation of such massive assaults from independent sources.
   In_the_past such government claims have been found exaggerated.
     Two Americans and seven Cubans were executed by firing_squads today as Castro military tribunals began decreeing the death_penalty for captured invasion forces and suspected collaborators.
     A Havana radio_broadcast identified the Americans as Howard_Anderson and August_Jack_McNair.
     The executions took_place at dawn only a_few hours after Havana radio announced their conviction by a revolutionary tribunal at Pinar_del_Rio , where the executions took_place.
     The broadcast said Anderson , a Seattle ex-marine and Havana businessman , and McNair , of Miami , were condemned on charges of smuggling arms to Cuban rebels.
     Anderson operated three Havana automobile service_stations and was commander of the Havana American_Legion post before it disbanded since the start of Fidel_Castro 's regime.
     Anderson 's wife and four children live in Miami.
     McNair , 25 , was seized March 20 with four Cubans and accused of trying to land a boatload of rifles in Pinar_del_Rio , about 35 miles from Havana.
     At_least 20 other Americans were reported to have been arrested in a mass political roundup.
     Among them were a_number_of newsmen , including Henry_Raymont , of United_Press_International , and Robert_Berrellez , of Associated_Press.
     So many Cubans were reported being swept into the Castro dragnet that the massive Sports Palace auditorium and at_least one hotel were converted into makeshift jails.
   More_than 1000 were said to have been arrested - 100 of them Roman_Catholic priests.
     Of the millions who have served time in concentration_camps in Siberia as political_prisoners of the Soviet state , few emerge in the West to tell about it.
     M._Kegham - the name is a pseudynom - was a teacher in Bucharest and a member of the Armenian Revolutionary_Federation ( ARF ) - two reasons the Communists put him away when they arrived in 1945.
     Today , M._Kegham was in Detroit , en_route to join his wife and children in California.
    
    Emory_University 's Board_of_Trustees announced Friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state 's tax laws made such a step possible.
      Emory_University 's charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race  , board chairman Henry_L._Bowden stated.
     But an official statement adopted by the 33 - man Emory board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements at_present are a roadblock to accepting Negroes.
     The statement explained that under the Georgia_Constitution and state law , tax-exempt status is granted to educational_institutions only if they are segregated.
      Emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning , of true university grade , and meet its financial_obligations , without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to_it only so_long as it conforms_to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions  , the statement said.
     The statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation.
     An Emory spokesman indicated , however , that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws.
     The Georgia_Constitution gives the Legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if , among other criteria ,  all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people , and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people .
     At_least two private colleges in the Atlanta area now or in_the_past have had integrated student bodies , but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged by the state.
     Emory is affiliated with the Methodist_Church.
   Some church leaders , both clerical and lay , have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregation.
     The student newspaper , The Emory_Wheel , as early as the fall of 1954 called_for desegregation.
      From its beginning  , the trustees ' statement said Friday ,  Emory_University has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in Christian higher learning.
   Teaching , research and study , according to highest standards , under Christian influence , are paramount in the Emory_University policy.
      As a private institution , supported by generous individuals , Emory_University will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and Christian education.
      There is not now , nor has there ever been in Emory_University 's charter or by-laws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race , color or creed.
   Insofar as its own governing documents are concerned , Emory_University could now consider applications from prospective students , and_others seeking applications from prospective students , and_others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university , irrespective_of race , color or creed.
      On_the_other_hand , Emory_University derives its corporate existence from the State of Georgia.
      When and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory tax-exemption privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities , Emory_University will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the University without regard_to race , color or creed , continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of Christian higher education .
     A young_man was killed and two others injured at midnight Friday when the car they were riding slid into a utility pole on Lake_Avenue near Waddell_Street , NE , police said.
     The dead youth was identified as Robert_E._Sims , 19 , of 1688 Oak_Knoll_Cir. , SE.
     Patrolman_G._E._Hammons said the car evidently slid out_of_control on rain-slick streets and slammed into the pole.
     The other occupants were James_Willard_Olvey , 18 , of 963 Ponce de Leon_Ave. , NE , and Larry_Coleman_Barnett , 19 , of 704 Hill_St. , SE , both of whom were treated at Grady_Hospital for severe lacerations and bruises.
     The Atlanta_Negro student movement renewed its demands for movie_theater integration Friday and threatened picketing and  stand-ins  if negotiations failed.
     The demands were set_forth in letters to seven owners of first-run theaters by the Committee on Appeal for Human_Rights.
      We intend to attend the downtown theaters before the first of the year  , the identically worded letters said.
     The letters set a Nov. 15 deadline for the start of negotiations.
   They indicated that stand-ins and picketing would be started if theater owners failed to cooperate.
     Downtown and art theater managers and owners , contacted Friday night for comment on the COAHR request , said they had no knowledge of such a letter , and that it was not in the Friday mail.
   However , three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the proposed meeting if all_of the other managers decided to attend.
     The COAHR letter comes on the eve of a large gathering of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here Sunday.
   Several theater operators said , however , that there is little likelihood of the subject being discussed during the three-day affair.
     Student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration several months ago.
   Charles_A._Black , COAHR chairman , said Friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet with the students on Oct. 31 but had failed to show_up.
   He declined to name the three.
     Friday 's letters asked for a Nov. 15 meeting.
   Failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend , the letters said , would be considered a  sign of indifference .
     Black said COAHR  hoped to be able to integrate the theaters without taking direct_action , but we are pledged to using every legal and nonviolent means at our disposal .
     A prepared statement released by the student group Friday stated that  extensive research by COAHR into techniques and methods of theater integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket_lines and stand-ins before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits .
     Besides managers of downtown theaters , the students sent letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown area and Buckhead.

     A 24 - year-old Atlanta man was arrested Sunday after breaking into the home of relatives in search of his wife , hitting his uncle with a rock and assaulting two police_officers who tried to subdue him , police said.
     Patrolmen_J._W._Slate and A._L._Crawford_Jr. said they arrested Ronald_M._Thomas , of 1671 Nakoma_St. , NW , after he assaulted the officers.
     The officers gave this account :     Thomas early Sunday went_to the home of his uncle and aunt , Mr. and Mrs._R._C._Thomas , 511 Blanche_St. , NW , looking_for his wife , Margaret_Lou_Thomas , 18 , and their 11 - month-old baby.
     The younger Thomas ripped a screen_door , breaking the latch , and after an argument struck his uncle with a rock , scratching his face.
   He also struck his aunt and wife , and during the melee the baby also suffered scratches.
     When police arrived the man was still violent , Slate said.
     He attacked one of the officers and was restrained.
   About five minutes later he jumped up , Slate said , and struck the two policemen again.
     He was then subdued and placed in the police_car to be taken to Grady_Hospital for treatment of scratches received in the melee.
   Then he attacked the two officers again and was again restrained , Slate related.
     Slate said he and Crawford received cuts and scratches and their uniforms were badly torn.
     Thomas was charged with four counts of assault_and_battery.
   Two counts of assault on an officer , resisting_arrest , disturbance and cursing , police said.
   A hearing was set for 8 : 30 a. m._Tuesday.
     Mrs._Mary_Self , who knows more_than any other person about the 5000 city employes for whom she has kept personnel records over the years , has closed her desk and retired.
     Over the weekend , Mrs._Self , personnel clerk , was a feted and honored guest of the Atlanta_Club , organization of women employes at City_Hall.
     After 18 years in the personnel_office , she has taken a disability pension on advice of her doctors.
     As personnel clerk , she handled thousands of entries , ranging from appointments to jobs , to transfers to other employments , to pensions.
      I have enjoyed it and will feel a_bit lost at_least for_a_while  , she said wistfully Friday.
     One of the largest crowds in the club 's history turned_out to pay tribute to Mrs._Self and her service.
     Georgia 's Department_of_Agriculture is intensifying its fire_ant eradication program in an effort to stay ahead of the fast-spreading pest.
     The department is planning to expand its eradication program soon to four additional counties - Troup , Pierce , Bryan and Bulloch - to treat 132000 acres infested by the ants , according to W._E._Blasingame state entomologist.
     Low-flying planes will spread a granular-type chemical , heptachlor , over 30000 acres in Troup , 37000 acres in Pierce and 65000 acres in Bulloch and Bryan counties.
     The eradication effort is being pushed in Bibb and Jones counties , over 37679 acres.
   The department has just finished treating 20000 acres in urban_areas of Macon.
     Also being treated are Houston , Bleckley , Tift , Turner and Dodge counties , Blasingame said.
   The fire_ant is thought to infest approximately two million acres of land in Georgia , attacking crops , young wildlife and livestock and can be a serious health menace to humans who are allergic to its venom , Blasingame said.
     The north-bound entrance to the Expressway at 14 th Street will be closed during the afternoon rush traffic hours this week.
     This is being done so_that Georgia_Tech can complete the final phase of a traffic survey on the North_Expressway.
   Students have been using electric computers and high speed movie_cameras during the study.
   Perhaps the engineers can find_out what causes all the congestion and suggest methods to eliminate it.
     Incidentally , 14 th Street and the Expressway is the high accident intersection during daylight hours.
   It is followed by Cain_Street and Piedmont_Avenue , NE ; the junction of the Northeast and Northwest_Expressways and Jones_Avenue and Marietta_Street , NW.

    For a second month in a row , Multnomah_County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month 's need , the state public welfare commission was told Friday.
     It is the only county in the state so_far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary.
     William_Smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that Multnomah , as of Aug. 22 , had spent $ 58918 out of its budgeted $ 66000 in the category , leaving only $ 7082 for the rest of the month.
     At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $ 17000.
   But it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each_month , Smythe said.
   No request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however.
     The commission , meeting for_the_first_time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , Roy_Webster , of Hood_River , and Dr._Ennis_Keizer , of North_Bend , approved a year 's contract for a consultant in the data_processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in_the_past.
     The contract with Ray_Field , who has been converting the agencies electronic_data_processing program to magnetic_tape , would renew his present salary of $ 8 an hour up_to a maximum of 200 hours a month.
     Field does the planning for the machine_operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data_processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy_changes.
     Acting_Administrator_Andrew_F._Juras said that because of Field 's unique position and knowledge in the program , the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period.
     But he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what Field handles , and he said he personally  regrets very_much that the agency has not done this in_the_past .
     He pointed_out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing ,  and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke_down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave .
     Juras said he insisted Field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government.
   He also said that the salary , in_terms_of going rates in the field , was  modest  in_terms_of the man 's responsibility.
   The conversion to magnetic_tape is not_yet completed , he said , and added Field 's long service in state_government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program.
      Do you feel you can stand_up to the next legislative session and defend this contract ?
 asked Mrs._Grace_O._Peck , representative from Multnomah_County , of the commission chairman , Joseph_E._Harvey_Jr..
      My feeling at the moment  , he said ,  is that we have no alternative , irrespective_of some of the arguments about him.
   The continued operation of_this program depends_on having his service .
     Mrs._Peck , later joined by the commission 's vice-chairman , Mrs._Lee_Patterson , took Harvey to task for comments he had made to the North_Portland_Rotary_Club Tuesday.
     A publicity release from Oregon_Physicians_Service , of_which Harvey is president , quoted him as saying the welfare office move to Salem , instead of  crippling  the agency , had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses , with the key being improved communications between F + A and the commission staff.
      I rather resent  , she said ,  you speaking_to those groups in Portland as though just the move accomplished this.
   I think you fell_short of the real truth in the_matter : That the move is working_out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all the people.
   The staff deserves a_lot_of credit working down here under real obstacles .
     Harvey said his objective was to create a better public image for welfare .

     The FBI yesterday arrested on a perjury charge one of the members of the jury that failed to reach a verdict in the  Freedom_Rider  bus burning trial four weeks ago.
     U._S._Attorney_Macon_Weaver said the federal complaint , charged that the juror gave false information when asked about Ku_Klux_Klan membership during selection of jury.
     He identified the man as Lewis_Martin_Parker , 59 , a farmer of Hartselle , Ala..
     Eight men were tried together in U._S._District_Court in Anniston , Ala. , on charges of interfering with interstate transportation and conspiracy growing out of a white mob 's attack on a Greyhound bus carrying the first of the Freedom Riders.
   The bus was burned outside Anniston.
     One of the eight defendants was freed on a directed_verdict of acquittal.
   A mistrial was declared in the case against the other seven when the jury was unable to agree on a verdict.
     The arrest of Mr._Parker marks the third charge of wrongdoing involving the jury that heard the case.
     The first incident occurred before the trial got under_way when Judge_H._Hobart_Grooms told the jury panel he had heard reports of jury-tampering efforts.
     He asked members of the panel to tell him if anyone outside the court had spoken_to them about the case.
   Two members of the panel later told in court about receiving telephone_calls at their homes from anonymous persons expressing interest in the trial.
   Neither was seated on the jury.
     Then , when the case went to the jury , the judge excused one of the jurors , saying the juror had told him he had been accosted by masked men at his motel the night before the trial opened.
   The juror said the masked men had advised him to be lenient.
   The judge replaced the juror with an alternate.
     No formal charges have been filed as a result of either of the two reported incidents.
     At the opening of the trial , the jury panel was questioned as_a_group by Mr._Weaver about Ku_Klux_Klan connections.
     One member of the panel - not Mr._Parker - indicated he had been a member of the KKK at_one_time.
   He was not seated on the jury.
     The perjury charge against Mr._Parker carries a maximum penalty of $ 2000 fine and five years imprisonment on conviction.

    Vast spraying programs conducted by  technicians with narrow training and little wisdom  are endangering crops and wildlife , Carl_W._Buchheister , president of the National_Audubon_Society , said today.
      It is like handing a loaded.
45 automatic to an 8 - year-old and telling him to run out and play  , he commented.
     Buchheister told delegates to the West_Coast_Audubon_Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire_ant.
      But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar_cane crop  , he said.
     The conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming.
   There have even been serious errors in the U._S._Forest_Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added.
      The news of their experiments reach the farmers who , forgetting that birds are the_most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents , are encouraged to try to get_rid_of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries  , Buchheister told the delegates.
     In_addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying , Buchheister called_for support of the Wilderness bill , creation of national seashore parks , including Point_Reyes ; preservation of the wetlands where birds breed ; a pesticides co-ordination act ; stronger water_pollution control programs , and Federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by oil.
     The Reed_Rogers_Da_Fonta_Wild_Life_Sanctuary in Marin county on Friday officially became the property of the National_Audubon_Society.

     The presentation was made before several hundred persons at the annual meeting of the League at Olney_Hall , College of Marin , Kentfield.
     Buchheister pledged the land would be an  inviolate  sanctuary for all birds , animals and plants.
     Seventeen years ago today , German scientist Willy_Fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed in a V-1 rocket-bomb that was attached to the underbelly of a Heinkel bomber.
     The World_War 2 , German bomber rolled down a runway and took_off.
     The only way Fiedler could get_back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip.
   This had never been done before.
     Now a quiet-spoken , middle-aged man , Fiedler is an aeronautical_engineer for Lockheed 's Missiles and Space_Division at Sunnyvale , where he played a key role in the development of the Navy 's Polaris missile.
     He sat in his office yesterday and recalled that historic flight in 1944.
      The first two pilots had crashed  , he said.
    I had developed the machines and therefore knew them.
   It was time to go_up myself .
     Fiedler was then technical director of Hitler 's super-secret  Reichenberg project  , which remained unknown to the Allies until after the war.
     About 200 of the special V-1 rocket-bombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead.
   The target was Allied shipping - a desperate effort to stave_off the Allied invasion of Europe.
     The success of the project depended_upon Fiedler 's flight.
     Squeezed into the few cubic_feet normally filled by the rocket 's automatic guidance mechanism , the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude.
     At 12000 feet , Fiedler signaled  release  , and started the roaring pulse-jet engine - then streaked away from beneath the Heinkel.
     To the German pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck , hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m. p. h..
     It was probably man 's first successful flight in a missile.
    She flew beautifully  , said Fiedler.
    There was only one power control - a valve to adjust the fuel flow.
   I had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip .
     Using a steering_system that controlled the modified rocket 's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons , Fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage.
     He managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m. p. h. - fast even for a modern jet_plane touchdown - and banked into the airfield.
     Moments later the V-1 skimmed across the landing_strip , edging closer and closer to a touchdown - then in a streamer of dust it landed.
     Fiedler went_on to make several other test flights before German pilots took_over the Reichenberg missiles.
     The missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb.
   Pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water , striking below the waterline of individual ships.
     A crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers , but the project was halted before the end of the war , and the missiles later fell_into Allied hands.
     Now a family_man with three children , Fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the Lockheed plant at Sunnyvale.
   His spare_time is spent in soaring gliders.
      It 's so quiet  , he said ,  so slow , serene - and so challenging .

     Dr._Albert_Schweitzer , world-famous theologian and medical missionary , has endorsed an Easter_March for Disarmament which begins tomorrow in Sunnyvale.
     Members of the San_Francisco American Friends Service , a Quaker organization , will march to San_Francisco for a rally in Union_Square at 2 p. m._Saturday.
     In a letter to the American Friends Service , Dr._Schweitzer wrote :      Leading Nations of the West and of the East keep busy making newer nuclear_weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break_out.
      They cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise_attack.
   The only way_out of_this state_of_affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear_weapons ; otherwise no peace is possible.
      Governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware_of this danger ; therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear_weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency .
     A federal grand_jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of Ben_Stein , 47 , who collected big fees as a  labor consultant  and operator of a janitors ' service.
     Before he testified for 20 minutes , Stein , who lives at 3300 Lake_Shore_dr. , admitted to reporters that he had a wide acquaintance with crime syndicate hoodlums.
     Among his gangland buddies , he said , were Joseph [ Joey ] Glimco , a mob labor racketeer , and four gang gambling chiefs , Gus [ Slim ] Alex , Ralph_Pierce , Joe [ Caesar ] DiVarco , and Jimmy [ Monk ] Allegretti.
     Another hoodlum , Louis_Arger , drew $ 39000 from Stein 's janitor firm , the National_Maintenance company , in three years ending in 1959 , Stein disclosed in an interview.
      I put Arger on the payroll because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at Navy pier  , Stein said.
    But Arger never was able to produce it , so I cut him off my payroll .
     Other witnesses , after appearances before the jury , which reportedly is probing into possible income_tax violations , disclosed that government prosecutors were attempting to connect Stein and his company with a_number_of gangsters , including Glimco and Alex.
     The federal lawyers , according to their witnesses , also were tracing Stein 's fees as a labor consultant.
   Under scrutiny , two of the witnesses said , were payments and loans to Stein 's National_Maintenance company at 543 Madison_st..
     The company supplies janitors and workmen for McCormick_Place and factories , liquor firms , and other businesses.
     Among the witnesses were Ed_J._Lee , director of McCormick_Place ; Jerome_Leavitt , a partner in the Union_Liquor company , 3247 S._Kedzie av. , Dominic_Senese , a teamster union slugger who is a buddy of Stein and a cousin of Tony_Accardo , onetime gang chief ; and Frank_W._Pesce , operator of a Glimco dominated deodorant firm , the Best Sanitation and Supply company , 1215 Blue_Island av..
     Lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement in April with Stein to supply and supervise janitors in McCormick_Place.
   Stein 's fee , Lee said , was 10 per_cent of the janitors ' pay.
   Stein estimated this amount at  about $ 1500 or $ 1600 a month .
     Leavitt , as he entered the jury room , said he was prepared to answer questions about the $ 12500 his liquor firm paid to Stein for  labor consultant work  with five unions which organized Leavitt 's workers.
   Leavitt identified the unions as a warehouseman 's local , the teamsters union , a salesman 's union , the janitors ' union , and a bottling workers ' union.
     Government attorneys , Leavitt said , have questioned him closely about  five or six loans  totaling about $ 40000 which the liquor company made to Stein in the last year.
     All_of the loans , in amounts up_to $ 5000 each , have been repaid by Stein , according to Leavitt.
   Stein said he needed the money , Leavitt said , to  meet the payroll  at National_Maintenance company.
     The deodorant firm run by Pesce has offices in the headquarters of Glimco 's discredited taxi drivers ' union at 1213 - 15 Blue_Island av..
     The radiation station of the Chicago board of health recorded a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation per cubic_meter of air over Chicago yesterday.
     The reading , which has been watched with interest since Russia 's detonation of a super bomb Monday , was 4 on Tuesday and 7 last Saturday , a_level far below the danger point , according to the board of health.
     The weather_bureau has estimated that radioactive fallout from the test might arrive here next week.
   A board of health spokesman said there is no reason to believe that an increase in the level here will occur as a result of the detonation.
     Curtis_Allen_Huff , 41 , of 1630 Lake av. , Wilmette , was arrested yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling an undetermined amount_of_money from the First_Federal Savings_and_Loan_association , 1 S._Dearborn_st. , where he formerly was employed as an attorney.
     Federal prosecutors estimated that the amount may total $ 20000 , altho a spokesman for the association estimated its loss at approximately $ 10000.
     Huff 's attorney , Antone_F._Gregorio , quoted his client as saying that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to Huff , as attorney for the loan association , in satisfaction of mechanic 's liens on property on_which the association held mortgages.
     Huff told Gregorio that he took the money to pay  the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living .
     Huff , who received a salary of $ 109 a week from the loan association from October of 1955 until September of_this year , said that his private practice was not lucrative.
   Huff lives with his wife , Sue , and their four children , 6 to 10 years old , in a $ 25000 home with a $ 17000 mortgage.
     The complaint on_which the warrant was issued was filed by Leo_Blaber , an attorney for the association.
     The shortage was discovered after Huff failed to report for work on Sept. 18.
   On_that date , according to Gregorio , Huff left his home and took a room in the New_Lawrence hotel at 1020 Lawrence av..
   There , Gregorio said , Huff wrote a complete statement of his offense.
     Later , Huff cashed three checks for $ 100 each at the Sherman_House , using a credit_card.
   All bounced.
     When Huff attempted to cash another $ 100 check there Monday , hotel officials called police.
     Greece and West_Germany have ratified an agreement under which Germany will pay $ 28700000 to Greek victims of Nazi persecution , it was announced today.
    
    Probably THE hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods_stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week.
     For many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous.
   It was not a case of the investment_bankers having to sell the stock ; it was more one of allotting a_few shares to a_number_of customers and explaining to others why they had no_more to sell.
     Investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended_up with 25 , and customers who had put_in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many.
     In_fact , very_few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more_than 100 shares.
   Some Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all_of their customers.
     A measure of how hot the stock was , can be found in_what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began.
     The stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $ 12.50 a share.
   The first over-the-counter trade Wednesday afternoon at Eppler , Guerin + Turner , the managing underwriter , was at $ 17 a share.
   And from_that the stock moved right_on up until it was trading Thursday morning at around $ 22 a share.
     But the Morton Foods issue was hot long before it was on the market.
   Indeed , from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in Dallas last January , the inquiries and demand for the stock started building_up.
     Letters by the reams came_in from investment firms all_over the nation , all_of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold ( 185000 to the public at $ 12.50 , with another 5000 reserved for Morton Foods employes at $ 11.50 a share ).
     There was even a cable in French from a bank in Switzerland that had somehow learned about the Dallas stock offering.
    We subscribe 500 shares of Morton Foods of Texas.
   Cable confirmation  , it said translated.
   But E._G._T. could not let the_Swiss bank have even 10 shares.
     After it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not_many shares for anyone.
     But the result of_it all was , E._G._T. partner Dean_Guerin believes , an effective distribution of the stock to owners all_over the nation.
      I feel confident the stock will qualify for the ' national list  ' , he said , meaning its market_price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all_over the country.
     He was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that Dallas investment men can do just_as good a job as the big New_York investment_bankers claim only they can do.
     But what made the Morton Foods_stock issue such a hot one?
     The answer is that it was a combination of circumstances.
     First , the general stock_market has been boiling upward for the last few months , driving stocks of all kinds up.
   As a result , it is not easy to find a stock priced as the Morton issue was priced ( at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings , to yield a_little over 5 per_cent on the 64 c anticipated dividend ).
     Second , the  potato_chip industry  has caught the fancy of investors lately , and until Morton Foods came_along there were only two potato_chip stocks - Frito and H._W._Lay - on the market.
     Both of those have had dynamic run-ups in price on the market in recent months , both were selling at higher price-earnings and yield bases than Morton was coming to market at , and everyone who knew anything about it expected the Morton stock to have a fast run-up.
     And third , the potato_chip industry has taken_on the flavor of a  growth  industry in the public mind of_late.
   Foods , which long had been considered  recession resistant  but hardly dynamic stocks , have been acting like growth_stocks , going_to higher price-earnings ratios.
     The potato_chip industry these days is growing , not_only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience_foods , but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger.
     The history of the U._S. potato_chip industry is that many_of today 's successful companies got_started during the deep depression days.
   Those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives , men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival_of_the_fittest.
     But today many_of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate_tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management in their firms.
     So they go looking_for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock , and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like Frito.
     All those things combined to make the Morton Foods_stock the hot_issue that it was and is.
     Now , if Morton 's newest product , a corn_chip known as Chip-o 's , turns_out to sell as_well as its stock did , the stock may turn_out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up_to.
   Dallas and North_Texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing and distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies , valued in the millions of dollars.
     More_than 10 companies maintain facilities in Dallas and one large manufacturer is located to_the_north at Sherman.
     It is no coincidence that the Texas_Cotton_Ginner 's Association is meeting here this week for the 46 th time in their 52 - year history.
     The exhibition of cotton ginning machinery at the State_Fair grounds is valued_at more_than a_million dollars.
   It weighs in the tons , so the proximity of factory and exhibition_area makes it possible for an outstanding exhibit each_year.
     A modern cotton gin plant costs in the neighborhood of $ 250000 , and it 's a safe assumption that a large percentage of new gins in the U._S. and foreign countries contain machinery made in_this area.
     The Murray_Co. of Texas , Inc. , originated_in Dallas in 1896.
   They 've occupied a 22 - acre site since the early 1900 's.
   More_than 700 employes make gin machinery that 's sold anywhere cotton is grown.
     Murray makes a complete line of ginning equipment except for driers and cleaners , and this machinery is purchased from a Dallas-based firm.
     The Continental_Gin_Co. began operations in Dallas in 1899.
   The present company is a combination of several smaller ones that date_back to 1834.
     Headquarters is in Birmingham , Ala..
   Factories are located here and in Prattville , Ala..
   About 40 per_cent of the manufacturing is done at the Dallas plant by more_than 200 employes.
     The company sells a complete line of gin machinery all_over the cotton-growing world.
     Hardwicke-Etter_Co. of Sherman makes a full line of gin machinery and equipment.
   The firm recently expanded domestic sales into the Southeastern states as a result of an agreement with Cen-Tennial_Gin_Co..
   They export also.
     The company began operation in 1900 with hardware and oil mill supplies.
   In 1930 , they began making cotton processing equipment.
   Presently , Hardwicke-Etter employs 300 - 450 people , depending_on the season of the year.
     The Lummus_Cotton_Gin_Co. has had a sales and service office in Dallas since 1912.
   Factory operations are in Columbus , Ga..
   The district office here employs about 65.
     The Moss_Gordin_Lint_Cleaner_Co. and Gordin Unit System of Ginning have joint headquarters here.
   The cleaner equipment firm began operations in 1953 and the unit system , which turns_out a complete ginning system , began operations in 1959.
     Gordin manufacturing operations are in Lubbock.
     The John_E._Mitchell_Co. began work in Dallas in 1928.
   The firm is prominent in making equipment for cleaning seed cotton , driers , and heaters , and they lay_claim_to being the first maker ( 1910 ) of boil extraction equipment.
     The increase in mechanical harvesting of cotton makes cleaning and drying equipment a must for modern gin operation.
     Mitchell employs a total of about 400 people.
   They export cotton ginning machinery.
     The Hinckley_Gin_Supply_Co. is a maker of  overhead equipment .
   This includes driers , cleaners , burr extractors , separators and piping that 's located above gin stands_in a complete gin.
     The firm began operations back in 1925 and sells equipment in the central cotton belt , including the Mississippi_Delta.
     The Cen-Tennial_Gin_Supply_Co. has home_offices and factory facilities here.
   They make gin saws and deal in parts , supplies and some used gin machinery.
     The Stacy_Co. makes cleaning and drying equipment for_sale largely in Texas.
   They 've been in Dallas since 1921.
     Cotton_Belt_Gin_Service , Inc. of Dallas makes gin saws and started here 14 years ago.
   They distribute equipment in 11 states.
   The firm also handles gin and oil mill supplies such_as belting , bearings , etc..
     Cotton processing equipment is a sizable segment of Dallas business economy.
   New car sales in Dallas_County during March showed slight signs of recovering from the_doldrums which have characterized sales this year.
     Registrations of new cars in Dallas_County cracked the 3000 mark in March for_the_first_time this year.
     Totaling 3399 , sales jumped 14 per_cent over February 's 2963.
   However , compared with March 1960 new car sales of 4441 , this March was off 23 per_cent.
     On a quarter-to-quarter comparison , the first_quarter of 1961 total of 9273 cars was 21 per_cent behind the previous year 's 3 - month total of 11744.
     This year-to-year decline for Dallas_County closely follows the national trend - estimated sales of domestic cars in the U._S. for first three months of 1961 were about 1212000 or 80 per_cent of the total in the first_quarter a year earlier.
     With the March pickup , dealers are optimistic that the April-June quarter will equal or top last year.
   The March gain plus this optimism has been encouraging enough to prompt auto_makers to boost production schedules for the next quarter.
     On the local level , compacts continue to grab a larger share of the market at the expense of lower-priced standard models and foreign cars.
   Only three standard models - Buick , Chrysler , and Mercury - had slight year-to-year gains in March sales in the county.
     The top 3 students from 11 participating Dallas_County high_schools will be honored by the Dallas Sales Executives Club at a banquet at 6 p. m._Tuesday in the Sam_Houston_Room of the Sheraton-Dallas_Hotel as the club winds_up its annual Distributive_Education project.
     Now in its third year , the program is designed to provide a laboratory for those youngsters seeking careers in marketing and salesmanship.
   Business_firms provide 20 weeks of practical employment to supplement classroom instruction in these fields.
     More_than 500 juniors and seniors are taking_part in the program and 100 firms offer jobs on an educational rather_than a need basis.
     Principal address will be delivered by Gerald_T._Owens , national sales manager for Isodine_Pharmical_Corp. of New_York.
     The 33 honored students are : Mike_Trigg , Raymond_Arrington , and Ronald_Kaminsky of Bryan_Adams , Janice_Whitney , Fil_Terral , and Carl_David_Page of W._H._Adamson ; Bill_Burke , Tommie_Freeman , and Lawrence_Paschall of N._R._Crozier_Tech._Paulah_Thompson , Gerald_Kestner , and Nancy_Stephenson of Hillcrest ; Arnold_Hayes , Mary_Ann_Shay , and Lloyd_Satterfield of Thomas_Jefferson ;     William_Cluck , Deloris_Carrel_Carty , and Edna_Earl_Eaton of North_Dallas ; Patricia_Ann_Neal , Johnny_Carruthers , and David_McLauchlin of Rylie of Seagoville ; David_Wolverton , Sharon_Flanagan , and James_Weaver of W._W._Samuels ; William_Austin , Gary_Hammond , and Ronnie_Davis of South_Oak_Cliff ; Bill_Eaton , Carolyn_Milton , and Ronnie_Bert_Stone of Sunset ; and Charles_Potter , Ronnie_Moore , and Robert_Bailey of Woodrow_Wilson.
     The Kennedy administration 's new housing and urban renewal proposals , particularly their effect on the Federal_Housing_Administration , came under_fire in Dallas last week.
     The Administration 's proposals , complex and sweeping as they are , all deal with fringe areas of the housing market rather_than its core , stated Caron_S._Stallard , first vice-president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
    
     The present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn  , Beryl_W._Sprinkel , economist of Harris_Trust + Savings_Bank , Chicago , predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment_Bankers Assn. , California group , conference.
     Another speaker , William_H._Draper , Jr. , former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo_Alto venture_capital firm of Draper , Gaither + Anderson , urged the U._S. to  throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we won n't be pushed arouny any_more .
   He urged support for President_Kennedy 's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations.
     Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a  temporary flash in the pan  but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern.
      In_view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial  he said the odds appear to favor rising interest_rates in coming months , but  there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960 .
     Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism  is based on very limited and questionable evidence .
     Rather_than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959 - 60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth  , he said  it should be viewed_as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in_this recovery .
     He cautioned that  the greater danger in_this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation .
     The economist does not look_for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it  even more unlikely that the Federal_Reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958 .
     The unsatisfactory 1958 - 60 expansion , he said , was not_due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic_policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike.
     Draper declared ,  As I see it , this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today.
   We must justify our heritage.
   We must be ready for any needed sacrifice .
     He said that from his experience of two years with Gen._Clay in West_Berlin administration , that  Russia respects our show of strength , but that presently we 're not acting as we should and must .
     He called the Cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action , and noted that in war  you can n't buy yourself out and that 's what we 're trying to do .
     While he declined to suggest , how , he said that sooner_or_later we must get_rid_of Castro ,  for unless we do we 're liable_to face similar situations in_this hemisphere.
   Its the start of a direct threat to our own security and I do n't believe we can permit that .
     Stock_market Tuesday staged a technical recovery , erasing all_of Monday 's losses in the Associated_Press average and making the largest gain in about two_weeks.
     Analysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under way late Monday afternoon when the list sank to a hoped-for  support level  represented by around 675 in the Dow_Jones industrial average.
   It was a_level at which some of the investors standing on the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented in the averages.
     Although it looked_like a routine technical snapback to Wall_Streeters it was accompanied by some good news.
   A substantial rise in new orders and sales of durable_goods was reported for last month.
     Treasury_Secretary_Douglas_Dillon said the economy is expected to advance by a whopping 8 % next year , paving_the_way for lower taxes.
     The Dow_Jones industrial average advanced 7.19 to 687.87.
     Of 1253 issues traded , 695 advanced and 354 declined.
   New highs for the year totaled nine and new lows 14.
     Trading was comparatively dull throughout the day.
   Volume dipped to 3.28 million shares from 3.98 million Monday.
     A $ 25 billion advertising budget in an $ 800 billion economy was envisioned for the 1970 s here Tuesday by Peter_G._Peterson , head of one of the world 's greatest camera firms , in a key address before the American_Marketing_Assn..
     However , Peterson , president of Bell + Howell , warned 800 U._S. marketing leaders attending a national conference at the Ambassador , that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and  unconventional wisdom .
      As we look_to the $ 800 billion economy that_is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40 % in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal , management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed  , Peterson said.
      With this kind_of new product log-jam , the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go_up geometrically .
     The executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in_the_past , but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the short-term advantage which it often needs.
     Peterson said America has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas.
   He cited , as an example , how the American camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of Japan despite lower Japanese labor costs , by improving its production know-how and technology.
     He also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an all-automatic camera in Germany , with the result that it became the best selling camera in the German market.
     Election of Howard_L._Taylor to membership in Pacific_Coast Stock_Exchange , effective Tuesday , has been announced by Thomas_P._Phelan , president of the exchange.
     Taylor , president and voting stockholder of Taylor and Co. , Beverly_Hills , has been active in the securities business since 1925.
     Union_Oil_Co. of California_Tuesday offered $ 120 million in debentures to the public through a group of underwriters headed by Dillon , Read + Co. , to raise money to retire a similar amount held by Gulf_Oil_Corp..
     Gulf 's holdings could have been converted into 2700877 shares of Union_Oil common upon surrender of debentures plus cash , according to Union.
   Under the new offering , only $ 60 million in debentures are convertible into 923076 common_shares.
     The new offering Tuesday consisted_of $ 60 million worth of 4 - 7 8 debentures , due June 1 , 1986 , at 100 % , and $ 60 million of 4 - 1 2 % convertible subordinated debentures due June 1 , 1991 , at 100 %.
   The convertible debentures are convertible into common_shares at $ 65 a share by June 1 , 1966 ; $ 70 by 1971 ; $ 75 by 1976 ; $ 80 by 1981 ; $ 85 by 1986 , and $ 90 thereafter.
     American_Stock_Exchange prices enjoyed a fairly solid rise but here also trading dwindled.
   Volume was 1.23 million shares , down from Monday 's 1.58 million.
   Gains of 2 - 3 4 were posted for Teleprompter and Republic_Foil.
   Fairchild_Camera and Kawecki_Chemical gained 2 - 1 2 each.
     I bought 50 shares of Diversified Growth_Stock Fund on Oct. 23 , 1959 , and 50 more shares of the same mutual_fund on Feb. 8 , 1960.
   Something has gone_wrong some place.
   I am getting dividends on only 50 shares.
   In_other_words , I am getting only half the dividends I should.
     Write to the fund 's custodian bank - the First National_Bank of Jersey_City , N._J..
   That bank handles most_of the paper work for Diversified Growth_Stock Fund , Fundamental Investors , Diversified_Investment_Fund and Television-Electronics_Fund.
     The bank installed a magnetic_tape electronic_data_processing system to handle things.
   But it seems that this  electronic brain  was n't  programmed  correctly.
     This resulted in a great number of errors.
   And letters began to come_in to this column from irate shareholders.
     I visited the bank in March and wrote a story about the situation.
   At_that_time , the people at the bank said they felt that they had the situation in_hand.
   They indicated that no new errors were being made and that all old errors would be corrected  within 60 days .
     That 60 - day period is over and letters are still coming_in from shareholders of these four funds , complaining about mistakes in their accounts.
     Maybe it 's taking longer to get things squared_away than the bankers expected.
   Any shareholder of any of these funds who finds a mistake in his account certainly should get_in_touch with the bank.

     Alfred_Hayes , president of the Federal_Reserve_Bank of New_York , said Tuesday  there is no present need for far-reaching reforms  which would basically alter the international financial system.
     Hayes said that if a way can be found to deal effectively with short-term capital movements between nations ,  there is no reason , in my judgment why the international financial system cannot work satisfactorily for at_least the foreseeable future .
     New_York Central_Railroad president Alfred_E._Perlman said Tuesday his line would face the threat of bankruptcy if the Chesapeake + Ohio and Baltimore + Ohio Railroads merge.
     Perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect of the merger , but could possibly be an ultimate effect.
     The railroad president made the statement in an interview as the Interstate_Commerce_Commission opened Round 2 of its hearing into the C + O 's request to control and_then merge with the B + O.
      All these kind_of things weaken us  , Perlman said.
     Board_Chairman_Howard_Simpson of the Baltimore + Ohio_Railroad_Co. , testified the B + O was in its worst financial_condition since the depression years and badly needed the economic lift it would get from consolidation with the Chesapeake + Ohio_Railroad.
      The financial situation of the Baltimore + Ohio , has become precarious - much worse than at_any_time since the depression of the 1930 s  , he told the hearing.
     C + O president Walter_J._Tuohy was summoned back for cross-examination by New_York Central attorneys before examiner John_Bradford who is hearing the complex case.
     The New_York Central also has asked the ICC to permit it to gain control of the B + O.
     Central was rebuffed by the other two railroads in previous attempts to make it a three-way merger.
   The proposed C + O - B + O railroad would make it the hemisphere 's second largest.
     The government 's short-term borrowing_costs rose with Tuesday weekly offering of Treasury_bills.
   On $ 1.1 billion of 90 - day bills , the average yield was 2.325 %.
   The rate a week ago was 2.295 %.
      Consumer uncertain about economic_conditions .
     This was the chief reason for a so-so sales outlook given by two-thirds of 56 builders polled by the National_Housing_Center.
     Other reasons mentioned by one-third or more of the builders were  resistance to high interest_rates , cost advantage of buying over renting has narrowed , shelter market nearing saturation and prospects unable to qualify .
     The poll was taken at the Center 's annual builders ' intentions conference.
   It disclosed that the builders :     Expect their own production volume , and presumably sales , to jump 30 percent in 1961.
     Look_for home building nationally to advance less_than 10 percent this year from 1960 's 1257700 0 non-farm housing starts.
   The industry has said 1960 was a poor year.
   Starts were down 20 percent from 1959.
     Why the discrepancy between the builders ' forecasts for themselves and for the industry?
     The reason , says the Housing_Center , is that the builders invited to the intentions conference  are generally among the more successful businessmen , and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders .
    
    Farm machinery dealer Bob_Houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales :    We 've sold four corn pickers since Labor_Day and have good prospects for 10 more.
   We sold only four pickers all last year .
     Gus_Ehlers , competitor of Mr._Houtz in_this farm community , says his business since August 1 is running 50 % above a year earlier.
    Before then , my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20 %  , he says.
     Though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business , farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural_areas.
   Paradoxically , the sales rise is_due in large measure to Government efforts to slash farm output.
   Although the Administration 's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 , farmers , with the help of extra fertilizer and good_weather , are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines.
   Fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently.
   The higher price_supports provided by the new legislation , together with rising_prices for farm products , are pushing_up farm income , making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery.
     Seven of the eight companies that turn_out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of August have shown gains averaging nearly 10 % above last year.
    In August our dealers sold 13 % more farm machinery than a year earlier and in September retail sales were 14 % higher than last year  , says Mark_V._Keeler , farm equipment vice_president of International_Harvester_Co..
   For the year to_date , sales of the company 's farm equipment dealers still lag about 5 % behind 1960.
     Among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states , two out of three report their sales since August 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier , with the increases ranging from 5 % to 50 %.
   Not all sections are showing an upswing , however ; the drought-seared North_Central states are the_most notable exceptions to the uptrend.
     The significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry.
   The demand for farm machinery is regarded_as a yardstick of rural buying generally.
   Farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products.
   More_than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nation 's trucks , buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home_appliances , chemicals and other products.
     Farmers are so eager_for new machinery that they 're haggling less over prices than they did a year ago , dealers report.
      Farmers are n't as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale  , says Jack_Martin , who sells J._I._Case tractors and implements in Sioux_City , Iowa.
    This morning , we allowed a farmer $ 600 on the old picker he traded_in on a new $ 2700 model.
   Last year , we probably would have given him $ 700 for a comparable machine .
   Mr._Martin sold 21 tractors in August ; in August of 1960 , he sold seven.
     With dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25 % below a year ago , the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the country 's farm equipment manufacturers.
   For_example , farm equipment shipments of International_Harvester in August climbed about 5 % above a year earlier , Mr._Keeler reports.
     Tractor production at Massey-Ferguson , Ltd. , of Toronto in July and August rose to 2418 units from 869 in the_like period a year earlier , says John_Staiger , vice_president.
     With the lower dealer inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements.
   Merritt_D._Hill , Ford_Motor_Co. vice_president , says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers.
     Except for a_few months in late 1960 and early 1961 , retail farm equipment sales have trailed year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959.
   The rise in sales last winter was checked when the Government 's new feed_grain program was adopted ; the program resulted in a cutback of around 20 % in planted acreage and , as a result , reduced the immediate need for machines.
     Nearly all_of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects.
   Total farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129 % of the 1947 - 49 average , three points higher than the July_1 estimate and exactly equal_to the final figure for 1960.
     The Government also is aiding farmers ' income prospects.
   Agriculture_Department economists estimate the Government this year will hand farmers $ 1.4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments , well above the record $ 1.1 billion of 1958 and about double the $ 639 million of 1960.
   Price_support loans may total another $ 1 billion this year.
   With cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above 1960 , farmers ' gross_income is estimated at $ 39.5 billion , $ 1.5 billion above 1960 's record high.
   Net_income may reach $ 12.7 billion , up $ 1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953.
   The Government reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers rose in the month ended at mid-September for the third consecutive month , reaching 242 % of the 1910 - 14 average compared with 237 % at mid-July.
     Kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a High_Court depletion ruling.
     The Supreme_Court decision in mid-1960 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined.
   The company , in figuring its taxable earnings , deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products.
   Such  depletion allowances  , in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw_materials producers using_up their assets.
   The High_Court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw_materials removed from the ground , not to the revenue from finished products.
     A measure passed by Congress just before adjourning softened the ruling 's impact , on prior-year returns still under review , for clay-mining companies that make brick and tile products.
   The measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50 % of the value of the finished products rather_than the lower value of raw clay alone.
     President_Kennedy , in signing the relief measure into law , stressed he regarded it as an exception.
    My approval of_this bill should not be viewed_as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries  , the President said.
     Charitable deductions come_in_for closer scrutiny by the I._R._S..
     The Service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called_on to furnish a statement from the recipient organization showing the date , purpose , amount and other particulars of the contribution.
   Requests for substantiation , the Service indicated , can be especially expected in cases where it suspects the donor received some material benefit in_return , such_as tickets to a show.
     In such instance , revenuers stressed , the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received.
     A rule on the Federal deductibility of state taxes is contested.
     A realty corporation in Louisiana owed no tax under Federal law , on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in_line with a plan of liquidation.
   Louisiana , however , collected an income_tax on the profits from the sale.
   The corporation , in filing its final Federal income return , claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense , as permitted under U._S. tax law.
     The Revenue Service disallowed the claim , invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was tax-exempt income.
   The Tax_Court rejected this view.
   It said the tax-freedom of the gain in_this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations.
     The Tax_Court decision and a similar earlier finding by the Ninth_Circuit Court_of_Appeals challenges a year-old I._R._S. ruling on the subject.
   The Service has not said what its next step will be.
     Peace_Corps volunteers are assured a tax_benefit under the law creating the agency.
   It provides that the $ 1800 termination payment each cadet is to get , after serving a two-year hitch without pay , will be spread over both years , not taxed in_its_entirety at a possibly higher rate in the year received.
     The owner of a public_relations firm owed no income_tax on payments he received from a client company and  kicked_back  to the company 's advertising manager , the Tax_Court ruled.
   The taxpayer testified that in_order_to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager.
   The Court upheld the taxpayer 's contention that these  kickbacks  were not his income though they passed_through his hands.
   The Court limited its decision to the tax issue involved , commenting :  It is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction .
     A portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vessel.
   The Revenue Service said the addition of the attachment does not keep the range from coming under the Federal manufacturers ' excise_tax on household-type appliances.
     Hiring the wife for one 's company may win her tax-aided retirement income.
     A spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls , for_example , may be entitled to distributions under the company 's pension plan as_well as to her own Social_Security coverage.
   She would be taxed on the pensions when received , of_course , but the company 's contributions would be tax-free.
     A frequent pitfall in_this sort_of arrangement , experts warn , is a tendency to pay the wife more_than her job is worth and to set_aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income.
   In_that event , they note , the Revenue Service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law.
     Possible upshots : The company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments , or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made.
     State_Briefs : Voters in four counties containing and bordering Denver authorized the imposition of an additional 2 % sales_tax within that area.
   Colorado has a 2 % sales_tax.
   Denver itself collects a 1 % sales_tax which is to be absorbed in the higher area tax.
   The Washington state_supreme_court ruled that the state 's occupation tax applied to sales , made at cost to an oil_company , by a wholly-owned subsidiary set_up to purchase certain supplies without divulging the identity of the parent.
   The state 's occupation tax is computed on gross sales.
   The court held that the tax applied to non-profit sales because the corporations realized economic benefits by doing business as two separate entities.
     Consumer spending edged down in April after rising for two consecutive months , the Government reported.
     The Commerce_Department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail_stores dropped to slightly under $ 18 billion in April , down 1 % from the March level of more_than $ 18.2 billion.
   April sales also were 5 % below those of April last year , when volume reached a record for any month , $ 18.9 billion ( see chart on Page One ).
     The seasonal adjustment takes_into_account such factors as Easter was on April 2 this year , two_weeks earlier than in 1960 , and pre-Easter buying was pushed into March.
     Commerce_Department officials were_inclined to explain the April sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer buying in March.
   Adjusted sales that month were up a relatively steep 2.5 % from those of the month before , which in_turn were slightly higher than the January low of $ 17.8 billion.
    
    Greer_Garson world-famous star of stage , screen and television , will be honored for the high standard in tasteful sophisticated fashion with which she has created a high standard in her profession.
     As a Neiman-Marcus award winner the titian-haired Miss_Garson is a personification of the individual look so important to fashion this season.
   She will receive the 1961  Oscar  at the 24 th annual Neiman-Marcus_Exposition , Tuesday and Wednesday in the Grand_Ballroom of the Sheraton-Dallas_Hotel.
     The only woman recipient , Miss_Garson will receive the award with Ferdinando_Sarmi , creator of chic , beautiful women 's fashions ; Harry_Rolnick , president of the Byer-Rolnick_Hat_Corporation and designer of men 's hats ; Sydney_Wragge , creator of sophisticated casuals for women and Roger_Vivier , designer of Christian_Dior shoes Paris , France , whose squared toes and lowered heels have revolutionized the shoe_industry.
     The silver and ebony plaques will be_presented_at noon luncheons by Stanley_Marcus , president of Neiman-Marcus , Beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will be the Dallas_Society for Crippled Children Cerebral_Palsy Treatment_Center.
     The attractive Greer_Garson , who loves beautiful clothes and selects them as carefully as she does her professional roles , prefers timeless classical designs.
   Occasionally she deserts the simple and elegant for a fun piece simple because  It 's unlike me .
     In_private life , Miss_Garson is Mrs._E._E._Fogelson and on the go most_of the time commuting from Dallas , where they maintain an apartment , to their California home in Los_Angeles ' suburban Bel-Air to their ranch in Pecos , New_Mexico.
   Therefore , her wardrobe is largely mobile , to be packed at a moment 's notice and to shake out without a wrinkle.
     Her creations in fashion are from many designers because she does n't want a complete wardrobe from any one designer any_more than she wants  all_of her pictures by one painter .
     A favorite is Norman_Norell , however.
   She likes his classic chemise.
   Her favorite cocktail_dress is a Norell , a black_and_white organdy and silk jersey.
     Irene suits rate high because they are designed for her long-bodied silhouette.
   She also likes the femininity and charm of designs by Ceil_Chapman and Helen_Rose.
     Balenciaga is her favorite European designer.
      I bought my first dress from him when I was still a struggling young_actress  , she reminisces.
    I like his clothes for their drama and simplicity and appreciate the great impact he has on fashion .
     Black_and_white is her favorite color combination along with lively glowing pinks , reds , blues and greens.
     Of Scotch-Irish-Scandinavian descent , Greer_Garson was born in County Down , Ireland.
   Her mother was a Greer and her father 's family came from the Orkney_Isles.
     Reared in England , she studied to be a teacher , earned several scholarships and was graduated with_honors from the University of London.
   She took postgraduate work at the University of Grenoble in France and_then returned to London to work_on market research with an advertising firm.
     Her acting began with the Birmingham Repertory_Company and she soon became the toast of the West_End.
   Among stage performances was a starring role in  Golden_Arrow  directed by Noel_Coward.
   It was during  Old_Music  at the St._James_Theater that Hollywood 's Louis_B._Mayer spotted her.
     After signing a motion-picture contract , she came to America and had  Goodbye , Mr. Chips  as her first assignment after a year 's wait.
   Other triumphs include  Random_Harvest  ,  Madame_Curie  ,  Pride and Prejudice  ,  The Forsythe_Saga  and  Mrs._Miniver  ( which won her the Academy_Award in 1943 ).
     Honors that have come to Greer_Garson are countless.
   Just this April she was nominated for the seventh time for an Academy_Award for her portrayal of Eleanor_Roosevelt in  Sunrise at Campobello .
   She gave a fine portrayal of Auntie_Mame on Broadway in 1958 and has appeared in live television from  Captain_Brassbound 's Conversion  to  Camille .
   She is in Madame_Tussard 's Waxworks in London , a princess of the Kiowa tribe and an honorary colonel in many states.
     She is adept at skeet_shooting , trout fishing , Afro-Cuban and Oriental dancing and Southwestern archaeology.
   She now serves on the board_of_directors of the Dallas Symphony_Orchestra and the Dallas_Theater_Center and on the board_of_trustees of the Dallas_Museum of Fine_Arts.
   She is state chairman for the New_Mexico Tuberculosis and Cancer_Associations.
   Both Miss_Garson and her oilman-rancher husband are active supporters of Boys Clubs of America and patrons of the vivid art and opera colony that flourishes in New_Mexico.
     Back in college , today 's handsome Gander was the only male member of a Texas_Tech class on food.
   The pretty coeds must have ogled him all_day_long - but he dutifully kept his eye on the gravy.
     Last October he gave a public speech in Washington , D._C. entitled  Are Women Here to Stay ?
   So you can see that Gerald_G._Ramsey , director of SMU 's food services , is not the ordinary type of craven , women-trodden chef.
   He is apt to rear_back and claim his rights.
     RAMSEY , as SMU 's food wrangler , buys enough groceries to serve 32000 meals a week.
   Tell that to the little wife when she moans at the woman 's burden!
     He also dishes_up 3000 snacks.
   And he operates three cafeterias in the Student_Center , along with McElvaney_Dining_Hall and the athlete 's tables.
     Ramsey , 6 - 3 , 195 and ruggedly slim , says ,  I can n't remember when I did n't pester my mother to teach me to cook .
     He was in charge of the Hockaday_School meals from 1946 to 1950 , before he moved to SMU.
   And you 'll notice that in both places , there are acres of charming young_ladies who with little effort spice_up any chow_line.
     What does he feed his SMU football mastodons at the training table?
      Mostly meat and potatoes - they have to have that go-go-go without getting too fat  , says Ramsey.
   So he hides the mayonnaise.
   And to keep athletes ' stomachs from getting jumpy under physical duress , he bans all highly flavored condiments.
     WHAT DO the pretty SMU girls like on their plates?
      Pretty_much hamburger , hotdogs , steak and , at night , maybe pizza  , says the handsome food expert.
    Unfortunately , there is still little demand for broccoli and cauliflower .
     Ramsey has stoked up Harry_Truman , Henry_Cabot_Lodge , the King of Morocco , Clement_Atlee and other shiny characters.
   Once four Tibetan monks , in their saffron robes , filed through the cafeteria line.
      They are n't supposed to look at women , you know  , Ramsey recalled.
    What with all those pretty girls around , they had a hard_time .
     Use one 6 - ounce chicken_breast for each guest.
   Salt and pepper each breast.
   Dip in melted butter and roll in flour.
   Place side_by_side in a 2 - inch deep baking pan.
   Bake slowly about one hour at 250 - 275 F. until lightly brown.
     Add enough warmed cream , seasoned to taste with onion juice , to about half cover the chicken_breasts.
   Bake slowly at_least one-half hour longer.
     While this is baking , saute mushrooms , fresh or canned , in butter.
   Sprinkle over top of chicken_breasts.
   Serve each breast on a thin slice of slow-baked ham and sprinkle with Thompson seedless grapes.
     ( Leave_off the ham and you call it Chicken_Pontiac , says Ramsey.
 )     Contemporary furniture that_is neither Danish nor straight-line modern but has sculptured pattern , many design facets , warmth , dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability.
     That_is the goal of two new collections being introduced in Dallas this month.
     Though there has been some avant_garde indication that contemporary furniture might go_back to the boxy look of the ' 20 's and ' 40 's , two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated , but warm look in contemporary.
   These two , Heritage and Drexel , chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece , but a collection of correlated designs , each of_which could stand alone.
     The Heritage collection , to be shown by Sanger-Harris and Anderson 's Studio , has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at_one_time.
   Called Perennian , to indicate its lasting , good today and tomorrow quality , the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces.
     Walnut , wormy chestnut , pecan , three varieties of burl , hand-woven Philippine cane , ceramic tiles , marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence , the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors , brick or paneled walls , windows that bring_in the outdoors.
   It is a collection with a custom-design look , offering simplicity with warmth , variety and vitality.
     The Drexel collection , called Composite , to be_shown by Titche 's offers a realistic approach to decorating , a mature modern that is a variation of many designs.
     Rounded posts give a soft , sculptured look , paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches , table tops are inlaid in Macassar ebony or acacia.
   A high-legged buffet provides easy-to-reach serving , a cocktail_table has small snack tables tucked under each end , recessed arched panels decorate a 60 - inch long chest.
     An interesting approach to the bedroom is_presented , with a young , basic , functional group of chests , dressers and corner units and a canted headboard.
   The other bedroom has heavier styling , door fronted dressers with acacia panels , a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror.
     Colorful , bright Eastman_Chromspun fabrics , with the magenta , pink and white tones predominating as_well as golden shades are used with Composite.
   The fabrics have Scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles.
     Design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote Drexel 's fall 1961 group , Composite.
   The spider-leg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony , to set_off the lustrous brown of the walnut top.
   See-through design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an Oriental shoji flavor.
   To bring warmth to the dining_area , golden orange tones are used in the fabrics.
     Dignity and comfort , in a contemporary manner , reflecting the best aspects of today 's design , with substance and maturity , keynote the Perennian collection from Heritage.
   Center panel , hand-screened wood , actually is a back of one of the tall bookcases.
   Mellow bronzy-green-gold fabrics and the gleam of copper and hand-crafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the Alexander_Smith carpet in_all wool loop pile.
     The Vagabonds are  on_the_road  again.
   Members are on their way to Saledo , not by stage coach , but in air-conditioned cars.
     This coming weekend they have reserved the entire Stagecoach_Inn and adjoining country_club , Saledo , for festivities.
   Invitations have been extended_to some Austin dignitaries including Gov. and Mrs._Price_Daniel.
     Stagecoach_Days is the theme for the weekend on the Old_Chisholm_Trail.
     The get-together Friday night will be a banquet at the country_club patio and pool , and an orchestra will play for dancing.
     Guests will wear costumes typical of the Chisholm_Trail_Days.
   Ginghams and calico will be popular dress for the women.
   The men will be in western attire , including Stetsons and colored vests.
     Decorating the ballroom will be the yellow rose of Texas , in tall bushes ; bluebonnets and stagecoach silhouettes.
   There will be a large drawing of a sunbonnet girl with eyes that flash at the guests.
     Mr. and Mrs._Phil_G._Abell are chairmen for the Saledo trip.
   Committee_members aiding them in planning the entertainment are Messrs and Mmes Roy_McKee , George_McElyee , Jack_Fanning , W._H._Roquemore and Joe_Darrow.
     The travel club is comprised of 75 fun-loving couples who have as their motto  Go Somewhere , Anywhere , Everywhere .
   Their activities will be climaxed in the spring of 1962 when they go_to Europe.
     In_the_past , the men and women have chartered planes to Las_Vegas and Jamaica , buses to Mineral_Wells and Kerrville and private railway coaches to Shreveport and Galveston.
     Four parties are given a year.
   Two of these are in or near Dallas and the others away from the vicinity.
     Serving on the club 's board are Mmes R._P._Anderson , president ; A._F._Schmalzried , secretary ; W._H._Roquemore , treasurer , and the following chairmen : Mmes McKee , publicity ; Lawrence_B._Jones , yearbook , and Sam_Laughlin , scrapbook.
    
    A cooky with caramel filling and chocolate frosting won $ 25000 for a Minneapolis housewife in the 13 th annual Pillsbury_Bake-Off_Tuesday.
     Mrs._Alice_H._Reese , wife of an engineer and mother of a 23 - year-old son , was_awarded the top prize at a luncheon in the Beverly_Hilton_Hotel.
   Mrs._Reese entered 10 past bake-offs before she got_into the finals.
     Second grand prize of $ 5000 went to Mrs._Clara_L._Oliver for her Hawaiian coffee_ring , a rich yeast bread with coconut filling and vanilla glaze.
     Mrs._Oliver is mother of five children and wife of a machinist.
   She lives in Wellsville , Mo..
     Mrs._Reese baked her cookies for only the third time in the Bake-off finals.
   And the third time was the charm.
     She dreamed_up the cooky recipe , tried it , liked it and entered it in the contest.
   The second baking was for photographing when told she was a finalist.
   The third time was on the floor of the Beverly_Hilton ballroom and for the critical eyes and tongues of judges.
     Mr. and Mrs._Joseph_R._Bolker will give a dinner on Friday at their home in Beverly_Hills to honor Mrs._Norman_Chandler , chairman of the Music_Center_Building_Fund_Committee , and Mr._Chandler.
     Mr._Bolker heads a group within the building and development industry to raise funds in support of_this cultural center for the performing arts.
     A feature of the party will be a presentation by Welton_Becket , center architect , of color slides and renderings of the three-building complex.
     Fall foliage and flowers will decorate Los_Angeles Country_Club for the annual formal party Saturday evening.
   More_than 200 are expected at the autumn event which is matched in the spring.
     Among those with reservations are Messrs. and Mmes. William_A._Thompson , Van_Cott_Niven , A._B._Cox , David_Bricker , Samuel_Perry and Robert_D._Stetson.
     Others are Drs. and Mmes. Alfred_Robbins , and J._Lafe_Ludwig and Gen. and Mrs._Leroy_Watson.
     When Dr._W._A._Swim celebrated his 75 th birthday at the Wilshire Country_Club , guests came by chartered plane from all_over the country.
     A flight originating_in Florida picked_up guests on the East_Coast and Midwest and a plane left from Seattle taking_on passengers at West_Coast points.
     Cocktails and a buffet supper were served to more_than 100 persons who had known Dr._Swim when he practiced in Los_Angeles.
   He started practice in 1917 , and served on the State_Board of Medical_Examiners.
     Giving_up the violin opened a whole new career for Ilona_Schmidl-Seeberg , a tiny Hungarian who Fritz_Kreisler had predicted would have a promising career on the concert stage.
     A heart_attack when she was barely 20 put an end to the 10 - hour daily practicing.
   She put the violin away and took_out some linen , needles and yarn to while_away the long , idle days in Budapest.
     Now her modern tapestries have been exhibited on two continents and , at 26 , she feels she is on the threshold of a whole new life in Los_Angeles.
     Her days as an art_student at the University of Budapest came to a sudden end during the Hungarian uprisings in 1957 and she and her husband Stephen fled to Vienna.
     There they continued their studies at the university , she in art , he in architecture.
   And there she had her first showing of tapestry work.
     There 's a_lot_of talk about the problem of education in America today.
   What most people do n't seem to realize , if they are n't tied_up with the thing as I am , is that 90 % of the problem is transportation.
     I never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until , at_long_last , both of my boys got squeezed into high_school.
   It seems like only last year that we watched them set_out up the hill hand_in_hand on a rainy_day in their yellow raincoats to finger-paint at the grammar_school.
     Getting to and from school was no problem.
   They either walked or were driven.
     Now they go_to a high_school that is two miles away.
   One might think the problem would be similar.
   They could walk , ride on a bus or be driven.
     It 's much more complex than that.
   Generally , they go_to school with a girl named Gloriana , who lives down the block , and has a car.
     This is a way of getting to school , but , I understand , it entails a certain loss of social_status.
   A young_man does n't like to be driven up in_front of a school in a car driven by a girl who is n't even in a higher class than he is , and is also a girl.
      Why do n't you walk to school then ?
   I suggested.
    My father walked , through two miles of snow , in Illinois .
      Did you ?
   I was asked.
      No  , I said ,  I did n't happen to grow_up in Illinois .
     I explained , however , that I had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom.
     I had to ride a streetcar two miles.
   Sometimes the streetcar was late.
   Sometimes there were n't even any seats.
   I had to stand_up , with the ladies.
   Sometimes I got_on the wrong car and did n't get to school at_all , but wound_up at the ocean , or some other dismal place , and had_to spend the day there.
     I 've tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now_and_then.
   When they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car.
   She has to have at_least one car herself.
   I feel a certain loss of status when I am driven up in_front of work in a car driven by my wife , who is only a woman.
     Even that is n't satisfactory.
   If they have to take any car , they 'd rather take the big one.
   They say that when they take a car , Gloriana does n't take her car , but rides with them.
   But when Gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her , so the little car is n't big enough.
     The logic of_that is impeccable , of_course , except that I feel like a fool being driven up_to work in a_little car , by my wife , when everybody knows I have a big car and am capable_of driving myself.
     The solution , naturally , is the bus.
   However , it 's a half-mile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus , and it 's too hard on my legs.
     My wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there.
   But that 's hardly realistic.
     Nobody walks any_more but crackpots and Harry_Truman , and he 's already got an education.
     Advance publicity on the Los_Angeles Blue_Book does not mention names dropped as did the notices for the New_York Social_Register which made news last week.
     Published annually by William_Hord_Richardson , the 1962 edition , subtitled Society_Register of Southern_California , is scheduled to arrive with Monday morning 's postman.
     Publisher_Richardson has updated the_Blue Book  but it still remains the compact reference_book used by so many for those ever-changing telephone_numbers , addresses , other residences , club affiliations and marriages .
     Stars throughout the volume denote dates of marriages during the past year.
   Last two to be_added before the book went to press were the marriages of Meredith_Jane_Cooper , daughter of the Grant_B._Coopers , to Robert_Knox_Worrell , and of Mary_Alice_Ghormley to Willard_Pen_Tudor.
     Others are Carla_Ruth_Craig to Dan_McFarland_Chandler_Jr. ; Joanne_Curry , daughter of the Ellsworth_Currys , to James_Hartley_Gregg , and Valerie_Smith to James_McAlister_Duque.
     Also noted are the marriages of Elizabeth_Browning , daughter of the George_L._Brownings , to Austin_C._Smith_Jr. ; Cynthia_Flower , daughter of the Ludlow Flowers Jr. , to Todd_Huntington , son of the David Huntingtons.
     Listed as newly wed in the Pasadena section of the new book are Mr. and Mrs._Samuel_Moody_Haskins 3 ,.
   She is the former Judy_Chapman , daughter of John_S._Chapman of_this city.
   The young couple live in Pasadena.
   Another marriage of note is that of Jane_McAlester and William_Louis_Pfau.
     Changes in address are noted.
     For_instance , the Edwin Pauleys Jr. , formerly of Chantilly_Rd. , are now at_home on North_Arden_Dr. in Beverly_Hills.
     Mr. and Mrs._Robert_Moulton now live on Wilshire and the Franklin Moultons on S._Windsor_Blvd..
   The Richard_Beesemyers , formerly of Connecticut , have returned to Southern_California and are now residing on South_Arden_Blvd..
   But the Raoul Esnards have exchanged their residence in Southern_California for Mexico_City.
     Judge and Mrs._Julian_Hazard are now at Laguna_Beach , while the Frank Wangemans have moved from Beverly_Hills to New_York , where he is general_manager of the Waldorf-Astoria_Hotel.
   And Lawrence_Chase , son of the Ransom Chases , is listed at his new address in Oxford , Eng..
     Others listed at new addresses are the Richard_T. Olerichs , the Joseph Aderholds Jr. , the Henri de la Chapelles , the John Berteros and Dr. and Mrs._Egerton_Crispin , the John Armisteads , the Allen Chases , the Howard Lockies , the Thomas Lockies , and Anthony Longinotti.
     Newcomers of social note from other parts of the country are the Ray Carbones , formerly of Panama ; the Geddes MacGregors , formerly of Scotland , and Mr. and Mrs._Werner_H._Althaus , formerly of Switzerland.
     Here 's an idea for a child 's room that is easy to execute and is completely charming , using puppets for lamp bases.
   Most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies , and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action , rather_than put_away in boxes.
   Displayed as lamps , the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent.
     To create such a lamp , order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop.
   Measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket , allowing three to four inches above the puppet 's head.
   Make_sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted  L  , the foot of the  L  about three inches long , so_that the puppet can hang directly under the light.
     Using the strings that manipulate the puppet , suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base.
   In_this_way , you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position , with feet , or one foot , barely resting_on the pedestal.
   If the puppets are of uniform size , you can change them in_accord with your child 's whims.
     Although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony , it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a child 's playtime.
   Those illustrated are reminiscent_of a circus top or a merry-go-round.
   The scalloped edge is particularly appealing.
     Today 's trend toward furniture designs from America 's past is teaching home-owners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our Colonial era.
     A generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions.
   In the background lurked the feeling , however , that these pieces , beautiful as they were , lacked the utilitarian touch.
   So junior 's bedroom was usually tricked_out with heavy , nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the  hard knocks  , while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only.
     This is n't true of the many homemakers of the 1960 's , according to decorator consultant , Leland_Alden.
     Housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs , says Mr._Alden and they are doing it largely because Colonial craftsmen had  an innate sense of the practical .
     There are a_number_of reasons why the Eighteenth_Century designer had to develop  down to earth  designs - or go out of business.
    
    Hotel_Escape 's Bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction , the versatile  Kings 4 , Plus Two .
     This is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while - a well integrated , fast moving outfit specializing in skits , vocals , comedy and instrumentals all_of it distinctly displaying the pro touch.
     Show spotlights the Kings - George_Worth , Bill_Kay , Frank_Ciciulla and Gene_Wilson , flanked by Dave_Grossman and Ron_Stevens.
     The plus two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine , and the beat is solid.
     In the comedy division , the Kings simply augmenting talent and imagination with a_few props.
   Net result is some crazy-wonderful nonsense , part of_which can be classed as pure slapstick.
     Kings 4 , have rated as a popular act in Vegas and Western nightclubs.
   If they can n't chalk_up big business here then let 's stop this noise about how hip we are , and stick_to our community singing.

     Al_Fike , an ex-schoolteacher from Colorado , is currently pursuing the three R 's - rhythm , reminiscence and repartee - in a return class session at the Trade_Winds Hotel.
     Al has added some sidemen to the act which makes_for a smoother operation but it 's substantially the same format heard last spring.
     Newcomers are Ernie_Kemm on piano , Wes_Robbins , bass and trumpet , and Jack_Kelly on drums.
   It 's a solid show but , except for some interim keyboarding by Ernie , it 's Al 's all_the_way.
     Maestro 's biggest stock in trade is his personality , and ability to establish a warm rapport with his audience.
   He skips around from jazz , to blues to boogie - accompanying himself on piano and frequently pulling the customers in on the act.
     This is a bouncy show which may get a_little too frantic at_times , but is nevertheless worth your appraisal.

     Is there anything a frustrated individual can do about Communism 's growing threat on our doorstep and around the world?
     More_than 300 teenagers last Sunday proved there is and as_many more are expected to prove it again for Jim_Kern and his wife Lynn from 4 to 8 p. m._Sunday at_First Presbyterian_Church.
     At_that_time the second_half of the Christian_Youth_Crusade against Communism will be staged.
   A young real_estate salesman , Kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by Communism when in the Navy Air_Force.
   He was particularly struck by a course on Communist brainwashing.
     Kern began reading a_lot about the history and philosophy of Communism , but never felt there was anything he , as an individual , could do about it.
     When he attended the Christian_Anti-Communist_Crusade school here about six months ago , Jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set_out to do it.
     The best approach , he figured , was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at_First Presbyterian_Church.
     And he wanted to be careful that the kids not_only learn about Communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote - a Biblically strong Christianity.
     So the Christian_Youth_Crusade against Communisn developed and more_than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult advisers from Presbyterian_churches of the area sat enthralled at the four-hour program.
     This Sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by Kern on the world situation ; a review of the philosophy of Communist leaders by Ted_Slack , another real_estate_agent who became interested as a philosophy major at the University of Miami ; and talks on how their Christian faith can guide them in learning about and fighting Communism during high_school and college days , by Ted_Place , director of Greater_Miami_Youth for Christ , and Jon_Braun , director of Campus_Crusade_for_Christ.
     The second_half of the film  Communism on the Map  and the movie  Operation_Abolition  also will be_shown.
     Response to the program has been so encouraging , Kern said , that a city-wide youth school at Dade_County_Auditorium may be set_up soon.
     And to encourage other churches to try their own programs , Kern said this Sunday 's sessions - including the free dinner - will be open_to anyone who makes reservations.
     The need for and the way to achieve a Christian home will be stressed in special services marking National_Christian_Family_Week in Miami area churches next week.
     Of particular meaning to the Charles_MacWhorter family , 3181 SW 24 th Ter. , will be the Family Dedication Service planned for 10 : 50 a. m._Sunday at_First Christian_Church.
     It will be the second time the assistant manager of a Coral_Gables restaurant and his wife have taken_part in the twice-a-year ceremonies for families with new babies.
     The first one , two years ago , changed the routine of their home life.
      When you stand_up in_public and take vows to strive to set an example before your children and to teach them the fundamentals of the Christian faith , you strive a_little harder to uphold those vows  , explains the slender vice_president of the young couples Sunday_school_class.
     Until that first dedication service , he and Lois felt their children were too young to take_part in any religious life at_home.
   They have five daughters - Coral_Lee , 5 , Glenda_Rae , 4 , Pamela , 3 , Karen , 2 , and Shari , five months.
     But after_that service , they decided to try to let the girls say grace at the table , have bedtime prayers , and Bible stories.
   To their surprise , the children all were eager and quite able to take_part.
   Even the two-year-old feels miffed if the family has a prayer-time without her.
     Dade 's chief probation_officer , Jack_Blanton , will lead a discussion on  The Changes in the American_Family  at 7 : 30 p. m._Sunday at Christ Lutheran_Church.
     Mr. and Mrs._George_Treadwell will be honored at a Family_Week supper and program at 6 p. m._Sunday at Trinity Methodist_Church.
   He is the sexton of the church.
     A family worship service will follow the program at 7 : 45 p. m..
     The outstanding family of Central_Nazarene_Church will be picked by ballot from among eight families during the 10 : 45 a. m._Sunday service marking National_Family_Week.
     Every family of Riviera Presbyterian_Church has been asked to read the Bible and pray together daily during National_Christian_Family_Week and to undertake one project in_which all members of the family participate.
     To start the week of special programs at the church , the Rev._John_D._Henderson will preach on  A Successful Marriage  at 9 : 40 and 11 a. m._Sunday.
   New officers of the church will be ordained and installed at the 7 : 30 p. m. service.
     A father and son dinner sponsored by the Men 's Club will be held at 6 : 15 p. m._Monday and the annual church picnic at 4 p. m. next Saturday.
     The week will end with the Rev._Mr._Henderson preaching on  The Marriage_Altar  at 7 : 30 p. m._Sunday , May 14.
     The resignation of the Rev._Warren_I._Densmore , headmaster of St._Stephen 's Episcopal Day_School in Coconut_Grove , becomes effective July 15.
    
    Enrique_Jorda , conductor and musical director of the San_Francisco Symphony , will fulfill two more guest conducting engagements in Europe before returning home to open the symphony 's Golden_Anniversary season , it was announced.
     The guest assignments are scheduled for November 14 and 18 , with the Orchestra_Sinfonica_Siciliana in Palermo and the Orchestra of Radio_Cologne.
   The season in San_Francisco will open with a special Gala_Concert on November 22.
     During his five-month visit abroad , Jorda recently conducted the Orchestre_Philharmonique de Bordeau in France , and the Santa_Cecilia_Orchestra in Rome.
     In announcing Jorda 's return , the orchestra also announced that the sale of single tickets for the 50 th anniversary season will start at the Sherman_Clay box_office on Wednesday.
     Guest performers and conductors during the coming season will include many renowned artists who began their careers playing with the orchestra , including violinists Yehudi_Menuhin , Isaac_Stern , Ruggiero_Ricci and David_Abel ; pianists Leon Fleisher , Ruth_Slenczynka and Stephen_Bishop and conductor Earl_Bernard_Murray.
     The Leningrad_Kirov_Ballet , which opened a series of performances Friday night at the Opera_House , is , I think , the finest  classical  ballet_company I have ever seen , and the production of the Petipa-Tschaikowsky  Sleeping_Beauty  with which it began the series is incomparably the finest I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing.
     This work is no favorite of mine.
   I am prepared to demonstrate at an ytime that it represents the spirit of Imperial_Russia in its most vulgar , infantile , and reactionary aspect ; that its persistent use by ballet_companies of the Soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just_as stultifying alive today as it ever was ; that its presentation in_this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the American people ; that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms.
   All_of this is true and all_of it is totally meaningless in the face of the Kirov 's utterly captivating presentation.
     The reasons for this enchantment are numerous , but most_of them end in  ova  ,  eva  , or  aya .
   In_other_words , no merely male creature can resist that corps_de_ballet.
   It seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests - Miss_Omsk , Miss_Pinsk , Miss_Stalingr - oops , skip it.
     These qualities alone , however , would not account_for their success , and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this company 's collective personality.
   It is a kind_of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar_to the American ballet.
   that convention of Russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished Grand_Dukes driven to thestage out of filial piety , is totally absent from the Kirov.
   This is all the more remarkable because the Kirov is to ballet what Senator_Goldwater is to American politics.
   But , obviously , at_least some things have changed for the better in Russia so_far as the ballet is concerned.
     Irina_Kolpakova , the Princess_Aurora of Friday 's performance , would be a change_for_the_better anywhere , at_any_time , no_matter who had had the role before.
   She is the_most beautiful thing you ever laid_eyes_on , and her dancing has a feminine suavity , lightness , sparkle , and refinement which are simply incomparable.
     Alla_Sizova , who seems to have made a special hit in the East , was delightful as the lady Bluebird and her partner , Yuri_Soloviev , was wonderfully virile , acrobatic , and poetic all at_the_same_time , in a tradition not unlike that of Nijinsky.
   Vladilen_Semenov , a fine  danseur_noble  ; Konstantin_Shatilov , a great character dancer ; and Inna_Zubkovskaya , an excellent Lilac_Fairy , were other outstanding members of the cast , but every member of the cast was magnificent.
     The production , designed by Simon_Virsaladze , was completely traditional but traditional in the_right_way.
   It was done with great taste , was big and spacious , sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes , but sumptuous in a muted , pastel-like style , with rich , quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery.
     Evegeni_Dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra , one containing excellent soloists - the violin solos by the concertmaster , Guy_Lumia , were especially fine - but one in_which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unity.
     Mail_orders are now being received for the series of concerts to be given this season under the auspices of the San_Francisco Chamber_Music Society.
     The season will open at the new Hall of Flowers in Golden_Gate Park on November 20 at 8 : 30 p. m. with a concert by the Mills_Chamber Players.
     Sustaining members may sign_up at $ 25 for the ten-concert season ; annual members may attend for $ 16.
   Participating members may attend five of the concerts for $ 9 ( not all ten concerts as was erroneously announced earlier in The Chronicle ).
     Mail_orders for the season and orders for single tickets at $ 2 , may be addressed to the society , 1044 Chestnut street , San_Francisco 9.
     San_Francisco firemen busied themselves last week with their annual voluntary task of fixing_up toys for distribution to needy children.
     Fire_Fighters Local 798 , which is sponsoring the toy program for the 12 th straight year , issued a call for San_Franciscans to turn_in discarded toys , which will be repaired by off-duty firemen.
     Toys will not be collected at firehouses this year.
   They will be accepted at_all branches of the Bay_View_Federal Savings_and_Loan_Association , at a collection center in_the_center of the Stonestown mall , and at the Junior Museum , 16 th street and Roosevelt way.
     From the collection centers , toys will be taken to a warehouse at 198 Second street , where they will be repaired and made ready for distribution.
     Any needy family living in San_Francisco can obtain toys by writing to Christmas Toys , 676 Howard street , San_Francisco 5 , and listing the parent 's name_and_address and the age and sex of each child in the family between the ages of 1 and 12.
   Requests must be mailed_in by December 5.
   Famed cellist Pablo_Casals took his instrument to the East_Room of the White_House yesterday and charmed the staff with a two-hour rehearsal.
   He was getting the feel of the room for a concert tomorrow night for Puerto_Rico Governor_Luis_Munoz_Marin.
   President_Kennedy 's invitation to the Spanish-born master said ,  We feel your performance as one of the world 's greatest artists would lend distinction to the entertainment of our guests .
     For a good many seasons I 've been looking at the naughty stuff on television , so the other night I thought I ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies.
   After_all , this year 's movies are next year 's television_shows.
     So I went to see  La_Dolce_Vita .
     It has been billed as a towering monument to immorality.
   All the sins of ancient Rome are said to be collected into this three-hour film.
   If that 's all the Romans did , it 's a surprise to me that Rome fell.
     After television ,  La_Dolce_Vita  seems as harmless as a Gray_Line tour of North_Beach at night.
   I cannot imagine a single scene that_is n't done in a far naughtier manner on TV every_week.
     I believe TV watchers will be bored.
      La_Dolce_Vita  has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average TV Western.
   Week in , week out , there is more sex to be seen in  The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet .
   There is more decadence on  77 Sunset_Strip .
   There are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any private-eye series.
     In another respect , television viewers will feel right at_home because most_of the actors are unknowns.
   With the exception of Lex_Barker and Anita_Ekberg , the credits are as unfamiliar as you 'll find on the Robert_Herridge_Theater.
     Most_of the emphasis has been placed on a  wild party  at a seaside villa.
   Producer Fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties!
   The Dolce_Vita get-together boasted a strip tease ( carried as far as a black slip ) ; a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face ; a frigid beauty , and three silly fairies.
     Put them all_together and they spell_out the only four-letter word I can think_of : dull.
     Apparently Fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pall.
   What a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining!
     As a moral shocker it is a dud.
   But this does n't detract from its merit as an interesting , if_not great , film.
   The Chronicle 's Paine_Knickerbocker summed it up neatly :      This is a long picture and a controversial one , but basically it is a moral , enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps Rome has from her traditional political , cultural and religious glories .
     And when they sell it to television in a_couple_of years , it can be shown without editing.

   And you think you have language problems.
     The week went_along briskly enough.
   I bought a new little foreign bomb.
   It is a British bomb.
   Very austere yet racy.
     It is very chic to drive foreign cars.
   With a foreign car you must wear a cap - it has a leather band in_the_back.
   You must also wear a car coat.
     The wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a_little expensive.
   But we could n't really get_along without it.
      Where do you put the lighter fluid , ha , ha ?
 asked the gas_station man.
   The present crop of small cars is enriching American humor.
     Gas_station people are very debonair about small cars.
     When I drove a car with tail_fins , I had plenty status at the wind-and-water oases.
   My car gulped 20 gallons without even wiping its mouth.
     This excellent foreign bomb takes only six.
     When I had my big job with the double headlights and yards of chrome , the gas people were happy to see me.
      Tires OK?
   Check the oil and water , sir?
    They polished the windshield.
   They had a loving touch.
     The man stuck the nozzle in the gas_tank.
    What kind_of car is it ?
 he asked gloomily.
      It is a British Austin , the smallest they make .
      Get much mileage ?
      About 35 .
     The gas_station man sighed unhappily.
      What I always say is what if somebody clobbers you in a_little car like that?
   Crunch , that 's all she wrote .
      I will die rich .
      That will be $ 1.80  , said the gas_station man.
    The windshield looks pretty clean .
     Ah , the fair-weather friends of yesteryear!
   When I wheeled about , finned fore and aft , I was the darling of the doormen.
   Dollar_bills skidded off my hands and they tipped their caps politely.
     With a small bomb , I tuck it between Cadillacs.

    At_last the White_House is going to get some much-copied furniture by that master American craftsman , Duncan_Phyfe , whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the U._S. Presidents of the 19 th Century sent abroad for their furnishings.
     The American_Institute of Decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the Executive_Mansion 's library.
   The suite has been in the same family since the early 1800 's.
   The gift is being presented by  heirs and descendants of the Rutherford family of New_Jersey , whose famous estate ,  Tranquility  , was located near the Duncan_Phyfe workshop at Andover , N._J..
     Authenticated pieces of Duncan_Phyfe furniture are uncommon , although millions of American homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago.
   This acquisition is a matched , perfect set - consisting_of two sofas six feet long , plus six sidechairs and two armchairs.
     The AID has undertaken the redecoration of the * White_House library as a project in connection with the work being done by First_Lady Jacqueline_Kennedy 's Fine_Arts Advisory_Committee to secure antiques for the presidential home.
   It is the AID 's intention to create in the library  a miniature museum of Americana  before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall.
     The room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the Duncan_Phyfe furniture.
   The AID has found a mantlepiece attributed to Samuel_McIntyre of Salem , Mass. , an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the Capitol here in 1792.
     The mantel was found in a recently demolished Salem house and is being fitted over the White_House library fireplace.
   It will be painted to match the paneling in the room.
     The AID committee 's chairman in charge of the redecoration , Mrs._Henry_Francis_Lenygon , was in town yesterday to consult with White_House staff_members on the project.
   Mrs._Lenygon 's committee associates , announced formally yesterday by the AID in New_York , include Mrs._Allen_Lehman_McCluskey and Stephen_J._Jussel , both wellknown Manhattan decorators.
   Regional representatives appointed to serve from each section of the country include Frank_E._Barnes of Boston.
     President_Kennedy could n't stay_away_from his desk for the 75 - minute young people 's concert played on the White_House lawn yesterday by the 85 - piece Transylvania Symphony_Orchestra from Brevard , N._C..
   But he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music.
     At 4 p. m. the President left the White_House to welcome the young musicians , students from the ages of 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the Brevard_Music_Center summer_camp , and to greet the 325 crippled , cardiac and blind children from the District area who were special guests at the concert.
     It was the first in the series of  Concerts for Young People by Young People  to be sponsored by First_Lady Jacqueline_Kennedy at the White_House.
   She was not present yesterday , however , to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience.
     She is vacationing at the Kennedy summer home in Hyannis_Port , Mass. , and in his welcoming remarks , the President said he was representing her.
     As he approached the open bandstand , erected facing the South entrance to the Executive_Mansion , the band struck_up the  Star_Spangled_Banner  and followed it with  Hail to the Chief .
      I think they played Hail to the Chief better than the Marine_Corps Band , and we are grateful to them  , President_Kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking_hands with conductor James_Christian_Pfohl.
     After paying tribute to the conductor and his white-clad youthful students , President_Kennedy said ,  As an American I have the greatest possible pride in the work that_is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the United_States - schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young_men and women and opening_up the whole wide horizon of serious_music .
     He added  I think that sometimes in_this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that_is being done in this field .
     Displaying his knowledge of music , the New England-born President remarked that  probably the best chamber_music in the world is played in Vermont , by young Americans - and here in_this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers , and their work is being duplicated all across the United_States.
      This is a great national cultural asset , and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me , representing as I do today my wife , to welcome all_of you here today at the White_House .
     As he left the bandstand to return to his office , the slender , sun-tanned Chief_Executive paused along the way to shake_hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field_tent set_up for the guests.
     He expressed surprise to learn that pretty , blonde Patricia_Holbrook , 16 , of Mount_Rainier , had attended the Joseph_P._Kennedy_School for the Handicapped in Boston.
    The nuns there do a wonderful work  , the President commented.
   Patricia now attends the C._Melvin_Sharpe_Health_School in the District.
     Each of the children invited to the concert wore a name_tag marked with a red , white and blue_ribbon.
   They enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the White_House staff.
     Many_of the music-loving members of the President 's staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience.
   And it turned_out to be more of a family affair than expected.
   Henry_Hall_Wilson , a student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the President 's staff as liaison representative with the House_of_Representatives , turned guest conductor for a Sousa march , the  Stars_and_Stripes Forever .
     Transylvania_Symphony Conductor Pfohl said yesterday that Mrs._Kennedy 's Social_Secretary , Letitia_Baldrige , told about plans for White_House youth concerts before the National Symphony_Orchestra League in Philadelphia last spring.
     He said he contacted a friend , Henry_Hall_Wilson , on the President 's staff and asked whether his orchestra could play , in the series.
   A flow of correspondence between Pfohl and Miss_Baldrige resulted in an invitation to the 85 - student North_Carolina group to play the first concert.
     One of the_most interested  students  on the tour which the Brevard group took at the National_Gallery yesterday following their concert at the White_House , was Letitia_Baldrige , social_secretary to First_Lady Jacqueline_Kennedy.
      I was an art major in college  , Miss_Baldrige explained.
    I 've been here so many_times I could n't count them .
   She turned_out to be a fan , too , of Margaret_Bouton , the Gallery 's associate curator of education.
     Miss_Bouton headed_up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the Gallery had closed at 5 p. m..
   The Brevard group of 85 arrived at the Gallery at 6 p. m. , remaining for about 45 minutes.
     The Brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed_up later.
   They decided that they thought Rembrandt 's self-portrait made him look  sad .
   They noticed Roman_buildings in the background of Raphael 's  Alba_Madonna  and  texture  in a Monet painting of Rheims_Cathedral.
   Everybody had heard of Van_Gogh , the_French impressionist.
     Gallery_Director_John_Walker greeted the group , standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak_to them.
   He pointed_out to the young musicians that the National_Gallery  is the only museum in the country to have a full-time music_director , Richard_Bales , I 'm sure you 've heard af him and his record , ' The Confederacy  '.
     Along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group , went one of the Gallery 's blue-uniformed guards.
     In 45 minutes , the Gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the Renaissance to the late 19 th Century.
     A_few of them said they  preferred contemporary art .
     Among the other artists , whose paintings were discussed were Boucher , Courbet , Fra_Angelico.
     The thing that impressed one of the visitors the_most was the Gallery 's rotunda fountain  because it 's on the second floor .
     That imposing , somewhat austere , and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16 th st. nw. took_on bustling life yesterday.
     More_than 250 Scottish_Rite Masons and guests gathered in their House of the Temple to pay tribute to their most prominent leader , Albert_Pike , who headed the Scottish_Rite from 1859 to 1891.
     They came together in the huge , high-ceilinged Council_Chamber to hear the late leader eulogized.
   C._Wheeler_Barnes of Denver , head of the Scottish_Rite in Colorado , praised Pike as a historian , author , poet , journalist , lawyer , jurist , soldier and musician , who devoted most_of his mature years to the strengthening of the Masonic_Order.
     The ceremony ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of Pike in the House of the Temple.
   A reception and tea followed.
     About 1500 delegates are expected to register today for the biennial session of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish_Rite for the Southern_Jurisdiction of the United_States.
     The opening session of the 5 - day session will begin at 10 a. m. today.
   There will be a pilgrimage to Mount_Vernon at 2 : 30 p. m..
   A wreath will be placed at the tomb of George_Washington , one of_this Nation 's first Masons - a past_master of Washington-Alexandria_Lodge 22 in Alexandria.
     The marriage of John and Mary_Black had clearly reached the breaking_point after eight years.
     John had a job in a small firm where the work was dull and monotonous.
   He would come home in the evening tired and discouraged - in no frame_of_mind to play with their three children , or spend much time chatting with his wife.
     Hurt by his lack of interest and attention , Mary complained often that he did n't help around the house , and that he did n't really care about the family.
   She accused him of ignoring her.
   He in_turn told her she demanded too_much.
   They were both discouraged , disgusted and miserable.
     Mary decided she had had enough.
   Without any definite plan in mind , she went to a judge to see what could be done.
   The judge listened quietly as the young_woman poured_out her frustrations - then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from Family_Service before going_to a lawyer.
     Family_Service , sharing_in UGF , has five agencies in the Washington area.
   They offer to the people of_this community case work service and counseling on a wide variety of family problems.
     Because neither of them really wanted their marriage to break_up , Mr. and Mrs._Black agreed to a series of interviews at Family_Service of Northern_Virginia , the agency nearest them.
   For nearly a year , they have been receiving counseling , separately and together , in an effort to understand and overcome the antagonisms which had given_rise to the possibility of divorce.
   The interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of the problems confronting the other.
   They are now working together toward solving their difficulties.
     John received a promotion in his firm.
   He gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on life.
   Mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings , and the children 's bed-time is frequently preceeded by a session of happy , family rough-housing.
     To outsiders , the Blacks seem to be an ordinary , happy family , and they are - but with a difference.
   They know the value of being just that - an ordinary , happy family.
     Family_Service has helped hundreds of families in_this area.
   Perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital.
   But to the families it serves , their help cannot be measured.
   Family_Service could not open its doors to a single family without the financial support of the United_Givers_Fund.
     Anticipated heavy traffic along the Skyline_Drive failed to materialize yesterday , park rangers said , and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze.
    
    One of the initial questions put to President_Kennedy at his first news_conference last January was about his attitude toward a meeting with Premier_Khrushchev.
   Mr._Kennedy replied :      I 'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground .
     The President knew that a confrontation with Mr._Khrushchev sooner_or_later probably was inevitable and even desirable.
   But he was convinced that the realities of power - military , economic and ideological - were the decisive_factors in the struggle with the Communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting.
   He wanted to buy_time to strengthen the U._S. and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign_policy.
     Last Friday the White_House announced :     President_Kennedy will meet with Soviet Premier_Nikita_S._Khrushchev in Vienna_June 3 and 4.
     The announcement came_after a period of sharp deterioration in East-West relations.
   The heightened tension , in_fact , had been a major factor in the President 's change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the Soviet leader.
   He was not going_to Vienna to negotiate - the simultaneous announcements in Washington and Moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned.
   But Mr._Kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with Mr._Khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe.
     That objective set the high stakes and drama of the Vienna meeting.
   Despite efforts by Washington last week to play_down the significance of the meeting , it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold_war.
     The U._S. and Soviet heads of Government have met three_times since Sir_Winston_Churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call_for a fresh approach to the problem of peace  at the summit of the nations .
     The first time was in 1955 when a full-dress Big Four summit_meeting produced the  spirit of Geneva .
   The spirit served chiefly to lull the West while Moscow made inroads into the Middle_East.
     In 1959 President_Eisenhower and Premier_Khrushchev held an informal session in the U._S..
   That meeting produced the  spirit of Camp_David  - a spirit , it later turned_out , that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a Berlin settlement.
     On the third occasion - another Big Four summit session at Paris a year ago - there was no problem of an illusory  spirit .
   Premier_Khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the U._S. for the U-2 incident.
   The episode tended to confirm the U._S. belief that propaganda , the hope of one-sided concessions , and the chance to split the Allies , rather_than genuine negotiation , were the Soviet leader 's real aims in summitry.
     Thus when Premier_Khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new President , Mr._Kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem.
   Shortly before his nomination he had set_forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the Soviet leader in these words :      As long as Mr._Khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world_power is shifting his way , no amount of either smiles or toughness , neither Camp_David talks nor kitchen debates , can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations .
     The President had set for himself the task , which he believed vital , of awakening the U._S. and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance.
   He did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary.
   He wanted time , too , to review the United_States ' global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating.
   Above_all , he did not want to appear to be running hat in_hand to Premier_Khrushchev 's doorstep.
     At_the_same_time the President took_pains not to rule_out an eventual meeting with the Soviet leader.
   Ideally , he knew , it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels.
   But Mr._Kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting , provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with_it.
   It would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold_war , to try to probe Mr._Khrushchev 's intentions and to make clear his own views.
   Moreover , an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the U._S. was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions.
     Both elements - the caution about a meeting , the willingness eventually to hold one - were reflected in a letter from the President which Ambassador_Llewellyn_E._Thompson brought back to Russia late in February.
   The letter , dated Feb. 22 , was delivered to Premier_Khrushchev in Novosibirsk , Siberia , on March 9.
   It dealt mainly with a broad range of East-West issues.
   But it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with Mr._Khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted.
     Developments over the next two months , however , caused the President to reconsider the question of the timing.
   There were intense discussions in the inner councils of the White_House about the advisability of an early meeting , not because the international climate was improving , but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly.
     The President was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at Geneva.
   The deadlock has been caused by the Russians ' new demand for a three-man ( East , West and neutral ) directorate , and thus a veto , over the control machinery.
   In the U._S. , strong pressures have been building_up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the Russians may be secretly testing.
     Mr._Kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a Geneva breakdown , or even continued stalemate , would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear_weapons to other countries as_well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament.
   There was reason to believe that Premier_Khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear_weapons , particularly to Communist_China.
   The question arose as to whether a frank discussion of_that danger with the Soviet leader had not become urgent.
   Moreover , Moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies , including the U._N._Secretariat and the International_Control_Commission for Laos.
   Mr._Kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements , or even negotiations , impossible.
     Developments in Cuba and Laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit_meeting.
   Initially the White_House reaction was that the bitter exchanges with Moscow over Cuba and the conflict in Laos had dampened prospects for a meeting.
   At_the_same_time , there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the Soviet leader , as a result of those episodes , come_to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the West 's ability and determination to resist Communist pressure.
     In Cuba , the U._S. had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against Communist penetration even on its own doorstep.
   In Laos , the picture was almost equally bad.
   U._S. willingness to accept a neutral Laos may have led Premier_Khrushchev to believe that other areas could be  neutralized  on Soviet terms.
   Beyond that , Allied disagreement about military intervention in Laos - despite warnings that they might do so - allowed Moscow to carry_out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the pro-Communist forces.
   As a result , the West is in a poor bargaining position at the current Geneva negotiations on Laos , and South_Vietnam and other nations in Southeast_Asia are under increased pressure.
     In the light of those events , there appeared to be a real danger that Premier_Khrushchev might overreach himself.
   Ambassador_Thompson reported from Moscow that the Soviet leader 's mood was cocky and aggressive.
   He has indicated that he plans new moves on Berlin before the year is out.
   The President and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn Premier_Khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such_as Berlin , Iran or Latin_America from which there would be no turning_back.
     It was in_the_midst of such White_House deliberations that Premier_Khrushchev on May 4 made new inquiries through the U._S._Embassy in Moscow about a meeting with the President in the near future.
   Mr._Kennedy told Moscow he would give his answer by May 20 after consultation with the Allies.
   The response from London , Paris and Bonn was favorable.
   Firm arrangements for the meeting in Vienna were worked_out in a final exchange between Moscow and Washington last week.
   Apparently at the insistence of the U._S. , the simultaneous announcements issued in Washington and Moscow last Friday emphasized the  informal  nature of the meeting.
   The Washington announcement said :      The President and Chairman_Khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for_the_purpose_of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries.
   The meeting will , however , afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries .
     The Vienna meeting will bring_together a seasoned , 67 - year-old veteran of the cold_war who , in Mr._Kennedy 's own words , is  shrewd , tough , vigorous , well-informed and confident  , and a 44 - year-old President ( his birthday is May 29 ) with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy.
   The announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the U._S. of both approval and disapproval.
     The approval did not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreements at Vienna.
   The inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations.
   But those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary.
   Mr._Khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men.
   The feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the President and that plain talk by Mr._Kennedy would give him pause.
     Apart from the personal_equation , another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in_the_past the U._S. appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit.
   Premier_Khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of_that fact and in_the_end got his summit_meeting anyway.
   This time the initiative came , in_part at_least , from Washington.
     There was also the fact that by the time he meets Mr._Khrushchev , the President will have completed conversations with all the other principal Allied leaders.
   Thus he will be in a position to disabuse the Soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave Allied disunity.
     Finally , there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the President 's making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord.
   There is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout_the_world.
   If tests are to be resumed , the argument went , it is vital that the U._S. make plain that the onus belongs_to the Soviet_Union.
     Disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse.
   After Cuba and Laos , it was argued , Mr._Khrushchev will interpret the President 's consent to the meeting as further evidence of Western weakness - perhaps even panic - and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds.
   Moreover , the President is meeting the Soviet leader at_a_time when the Administration has still not decided on the scope of America 's firm foreign_policy commitments.
   The question was raised , for_example , as to what attitude the President would take if Mr._Khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from Southeast_Asia to the Middle_East.
    
    There are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory.
   Mollusks are a case_in_point.
   The shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel_out the possibility of future development.
   Though this may or may_not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American_Catholic higher education.
     There can be no_doubt that the American_Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities.
   The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather_than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that.
   By way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American_Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial_school system into existence.
     There is , however , one curious discrepancy in_this broad and flattering picture.
   Viewing the American_Catholic educational achievement in retrospect , we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade_school to university.
   But the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official American_Catholic project ; certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial_school system has been a matter of official policy.
     Official encouragement is one thing , but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds.
   American_Catholics have responded generously to bishops ' and pastors ' appeals for the support necessary to create parochial_schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning.
   They have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made.
   Diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility.
     All_of this may be understandable enough : it is , however , in_fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise.
   Yet for better or for worse , the truth of the_matter is that most American_Catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general Catholic support but rather to the initiative , resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities.
   Community esprit_de_corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible.
     To understand the past history - and the future potential - of American_Catholic higher education , it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit d ' corps of the religious community.
   It is something more_than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment.
   A religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere.
   The fact that the group orientation and group identification are_founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension.
   The net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship , the kind_of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting_edge of sacrifice and hardship.
     American_Catholic colleges and universities are , in a very real sense , the product of  private enterprise  - the  private enterprise  of religious communities.
   Had it not been for such private enterprise , diocesan authorities might of_course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees.
   There is however no point in speculating about such a possibility : the fact of the_matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the  family business .
   This  family-community  spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement.
     It is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of American_Catholic higher education , in_particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas.
   I think for_example of three women 's colleges with pitifully small enrollments , clustered within a_few miles of a major Catholic university , which is also co-educational.
   This is not an isolated example ; this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough.
   It would seem to represent esprit_de_corps run riot.
     Apart , however , from the question of wasteful duplication , there is another aspect of the  family business  spirit in American_Catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny.
   For while the past needs of the Church in_this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions , which in temper and tone closely resembled junior_colleges and finishing schools , it would seem that today 's need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its  pursuit of excellence .
   At the earlier  pre-academic excellence  stage of Catholic education , the operation could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis.
   But with today 's demand for professional qualifications and specialized training , the need for  outsiders  become more pressing.
     The problem is not merely that more  outside teachers  are needed but that a different brand is called_for.
   Commenting on the earlier stage , the Notre_Dame Chapter of the American_Association of University_Professors ( in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making ) noted that the term  teacher-employee  ( as opposed to , e._g. ,  maintenance employee  ) was a not inapt description.
   Today however , the  outsider  is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order ( otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him ) and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university.
   And while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene , the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second_class citizenship drawn_on any basis other_than that of academic rank or professional achievement.
     In the above mentioned report of the Notre_Dame Chapter of the American_Association of University_Professors , the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it :  Even with the best of intentions he ( the President of the university ) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of_which , considered ( as it must be by him ) in individual terms , is inhomogeneous , mortal and of extremely varying temperament , interests and capabilities.
   It is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are , in their opinion , identified with its highest good and ( to use that oft-repeated phrase ) ' the attainment of excellence  '.
     The pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar_to Notre_Dame : it is simply that the paradox involved in_this kind_of control of the institution by  the organization which actually owns  it , becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished  outside  faculty.
   It is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to  the organization which actually owns the university  : this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension.
   But in_any_case , one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded_as a particularly happy one.
    Outside  faculty_members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business.
     There are two reasons why failure to come_to_grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the Catholic university.
   In_the_first_place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel.
   Word spreads rapidly in the tightly_knit academic profession , much given to attending meetings and conferences.
   Expressions of even low-key dissatisfaction by a Catholic college faculty_member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype.
   In the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott :   all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the Catholic institution will be as_good_as those elsewhere.
     To appreciate the nature of the gamble , it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security , that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary_school system or in the Civil_Service.
   Much has been made of the fact that major Catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure.
   This is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated.
   When a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion , not_only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market_value of his services.
   A man does not make that kind_of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the  family .
     Just_as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices , it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major Catholic institutions.
   Adequate compensation is indispensable.
   Yet adequate compensation - and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking_up college teaching in_the_first_place.
   Broadly speaking the total Catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university.
   Religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather_than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the layman 's reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification.
     There is no need here to spell_out the conditions of creative teaching except to point_out that , at the college_level , the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels.
   The college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty_members but he also needs to feel that such communication , even informal debates over the luncheon table , are a contribution to the total good of the institution.
   But this in_turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation.
     The second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty_members who are part of the  in-group  that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees , is , therefore , the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself.
   This is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure.
   Yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control , there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in_order.
     The first is a negative warning : there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory_boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority.
   In the case of academic personnel the  feeling  of participation can hardly be  faked .
   Competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students ' illusion that they are making their own decisions.
   Those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar_with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken_in by  busy-work  and ersatz decision_making.
     In_any_case it is by_no_means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called_for at_all.
   In the Notre_Dame report , reference was made to the fact that faculty_members were reduced to  luncheon-table communication .
   In itself there is nothing wrong with this form of  participation  :   the only difficulty on the Catholic campus is that those faculty_members who are in a position to implement policy , i. e. , members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution , have their own eating arrangements.
    
    Sen._John._McClellan of Arkansas and Rep._David_Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws.
   Once_more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor_unions : the law must treat everybody equally.
   Or , in the words of Anatole_France ,  The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as_well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges .
     The public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of_this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor_movement has fallen as a result of Mr._McClellan 's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites.
   The Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program.
   In_addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in_excess of_what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill.
     It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not_only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers ' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike.
   Business_Week ( Aug. 9 , 1961 ) reports that the United_Aircraft_Company , against which the International_Association of Machinists had undertaken a strike , decided to keep its plants operating.
   The company incurred some $ 10 million of expenses attributable to four factors : advertising to attract new employees , hiring and training them , extra overtime , and defective work performed by the new workers.
   The company has billed the United_States_Government for $ 7500000 of these expenses under the Defense_Department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor 's business.
     Rep._Frank_Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the Armed_Services Committee.
   The committee remains unresponsive.
   Neither has Congressman_Martin nor Senator_McClellan been heard from on the_matter ; they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions.
     THE RECENT publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a_number_of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that_is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained.
   The anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete , but along completely undefined lines ; it must play a game in_which there never is a winner.
   The fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law.
   Hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy.
     Let us look_at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in_which General_Electric , Westinghouse and a_number_of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market.
   The industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated - whether marginal or average pricing is applied.
     The problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in_addition to the heavy electrical equipment.
   Accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price.
   Naturally , enterprises of the size of General_Electric are in a position to structure their prices in_such_a_way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short_time.
   Should these giants really flex their competitive muscles , they would become the only survivors in the industry.
   Uncle_Sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by  unfair competition .
   But if they show self-restraint , they do n't get the orders.
     Under_the_circumstances , the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind_of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted.
   Engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants.
   The paradox implicit_in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government , after the conviction , that General_Electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows.
   In_other_words , the anti-trust laws , designed to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday , Wednesday and Friday , become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday.
   And which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on Sunday?
     The question might be asked :  Do n't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts?
   Why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas , throw a_few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter , expressing their complete confidence in the laws ?
     The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by Thurman_Arnold , in The Folklore of Capitalism , back in 1937.
   He wrote :  the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations , and at_the_same_time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social_structure.
   Anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship.
   When corporate abuses were attacked , it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather_than control.
   In_this manner , every scheme for direct control broke to_pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws.
   In_any_event , it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known , held together by some of the_most fantastic ideas , all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government .
     This escape from control has led to management 's evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while.
   A plea of nolo_contendere , followed by a nominal fine , after_all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license.
   ( The penalties handed_out in the electrical case , which included jail sentences , were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions , perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities.
 )     If a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market , quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest.
   A secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle.
   However , one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational.
   Quite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational - and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor_union.
     Those who favor placing trade_unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform.
     Before 1933 , individuals who opposed trade_unions and collective_bargaining said so in plain English.
   The acceptance of collective_bargaining as a national policy in 1934 , implicit_in the writing of Section 7 A of the National_Industrial_Recovery_Act , has made it impolitic to oppose collective_bargaining in_principle.
   The Wagner_Act , the Taft-Hartley_Act and the Landrum-Griffin_Act all endorse the principle of collective_bargaining.
     The basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition.
   If a union cannot perform this function , then collective_bargaining is being palmed_off by organizers as a gigantic fraud.
     The tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal_profession.
   The problem must be faced squarely.
   If laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn ( unsupported , by_the_way , by any agricultural subsidy ) , then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them.
     Human labor was exactly that - a commodity - in eighteenth - and nineteenth-century America.
   As early as 1776 , Adam_Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations :  We have no acts of Parliament against combining to lower the price of work ; but many against combining to raise it .
   Eighteenth-century England , upon whose customs our common_law was built , had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies.
   In 1825 , the Boston house carpenters ' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers , who declared :  It is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies .
     There were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective_bargaining , but against labor monopoly.
   The courts shared the opinion of the employers.
   In People vs. Fisher , Justice_Savage of the New_York Supreme_Court declared :      Without any officious and improper interference on the subject , the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of_that which is paid for it ; but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means .
     Compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how Congressman_Martin , according_to the Daily_Labor_Report of Sept. 19 , 1961 , defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor  if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages , production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages , hours and conditions of employment .
     Senator_McClellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation.
   His bill , allegedly aimed at Hoffa , would amend the Sherman , Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in_concert with any other union - even a sister local in the same international.
     Paradoxically , the same week in_which Senator_McClellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation , the Civil_Aeronautics_Board was assuring the airlines that if they met in_concert to eliminate many costly features of air_travel , the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act.
   Indeed , it is in the field of transportation that Congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws ; for_example , the organization of steamship conferences to set freight_rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers.
   At the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation , a drive is on to abolish collective_bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no_more_than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight_rates.
     The passage of the Sherman_Act was aimed at giant monopolies.
   It was most effective against trade_unions.
   In the famous Danbury_Hatters case , a suit was brought against the union by the Loewe_Company for monopolistic practices , e._g. , trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer.
   The suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay_off the judgment.
     In 1914 , the Clayton_Act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity.
   The law could not suspend economics.
   Labor remained a commodity - but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti-trust laws.
     The courts , by interpretation , emasculated the act.
   In 1922 , the United_Mine Workers struck the Coronado_Coal_Company.
   The company sued under the anti-trust laws , alleging that the union 's activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce.
   ( What other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise?
 )   The court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce.
    
    At a closed-door session on Capitol_Hill last week , Secretary_of_State Christian_Herter made his final report to the Senate_Foreign Relations Committee on U._S. affairs abroad.
   Afterward , Tennessee 's Democratic Senator_Albert_Gore summed it up for newsmen.
   What Herter presented , said Gore , was  not a very encouraging review .
   That was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts.
   While Communists were undermining United_Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos , two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower_Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions.
     Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery , Dictator_Fidel_Castro suddenly confronted the U._S. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours , the U._S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U._S. citizens , plus 120 Cuban employees ).
   President_Eisenhower held an 8 : 30 a. m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decided to break_off diplomatic relations immediately.
    There is a limit to what the United_States in self-respect can endure  , said the President.
    That limit has now been reached .
     Through Secretary_Herter , Ike offered President-elect_Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new Administration with the breakoff decision.
   Kennedy , through Secretary-designate of State_Dean_Rusk , declined.
   He thus kept his hands free for any action after Jan. 20 , although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the U._S. and Latin_America ( see The Hemisphere ).
     After a White_House huddle between the President and top lieutenants , the Defense_Department reacted sharply to a cry from the pro-Western government of Laos that several battalions of Communist troops had invaded Laos from North Viet_Nam.
    In_view of the present situation in Laos  , said the Pentagon 's announcement ,  we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the Pacific .
   Cutting_short a holiday at Hong_Kong , the aircraft_carriers Lexington and Bennington steamed off into the South_China_Sea , accompanied by a swarm of destroyers , plus troopships loaded with marines.
   On the U._S.
 's island base of Okinawa , Task_Force 116 , made_up of Army , Navy , Marine and Air_Force units , got braced to move southward on signal.
     But by week 's end the Laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration ( see Foreign_News ) , and the U._S. was agreeing with its cautious British and French allies that a neutralist - rather_than a pro-Western - government might be best for Laos.
     There was a moral of sorts in the Laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war fronts.
   Political , economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic , mountainous little Laos was the last place in the world to fight a war - and they were probably right.
    It would be like fighting the_French and Indian_War all_over again  , said one military_man.
   But why was Laos the new Southeast Asian battleground?
     At Geneva in 1954 , to get the war in Indo-China settled , the_British and French gave_in to Russian and Communist Chinese demands and agreed to the setting_up of a Communist state , North Viet_Nam - which then , predictably , became a base for Communist operations against neighboring South Viet_Nam and Laos.
   The late Secretary_of_State John_Foster_Dulles considered the 1954 Geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement , saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the West.
   He began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of SEATO.
    The important thing from_now_on  , he said ,  is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern Viet_Nam from leading to the extension of Communism throughout Southeast_Asia .
     Russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of Havana , Russian intrigue in the Congo , and Russian arms drops in Laos ( using the same Ilyushin transports that were used to carry Communist agents to the Congo ) made it plain once_more that the cold_war was all_of a_piece in space and time.
   Soviet Premier_Khrushchev sent New_Year 's hopes for peace to President-elect_Kennedy , and got a cool acknowledgment in_reply.
   Considering the state of the whole world , the cold_war 's three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous ; but , in Senator_Gore 's words , it was  not a very encouraging  situation that would confront John_F._Kennedy on Inauguration_Day.
     As the 87 th Congress began its sessions last week , liberal Democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the House_Rules_Committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor.
   The liberal pressure bloc ( which coyly masquerades under the name Democratic Study_Group ) had fought the committee before , and had always lost.
   This time , they were much better prepared and organized , and the political climate was favorable.
   They had the unspoken support of President-elect_Kennedy , whose own legislative program was menaced by the Rules_Committee bottleneck.
   And counting noses , they seemed to have the votes to work their will.
     There were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the Rules_Committee : 1 ) to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock , or 2 ) to remove one of the conservatives - namely Mississippi 's 14 - term William_Meyers_Colmer ( pronounced Calmer ).
   Caucusing , the liberals decided to go_after Colmer , which actually was the more drastic course , since seniority in the House is next to godliness.
     A dour , gangling man with a choppy gait , Colmer looks younger than his 70 years , has gradually swung from a moderate , internationalist position to_that of a diehard conservative.
   He is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project , unless it happens to benefit his Gulf_Coast constituents.
   He is , of_course , a segregationist , but he says he has never made an  anti-Negro  speech.
   For 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the Rules_Committee.
   There his vote , along with those of Chairman_Howard_Smith , the courtly Virginia judge , and the four Republican members , could and often did produce a 6 - 6 deadlock that blocked far-out , Democratic-sponsored welfare legislation ( a tactic often acceptable to the Rayburn-Johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes ).
     There was sufficient pretext to demand Colmer 's ouster : he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-Kennedy electors in Mississippi.
   Reprisals are not unheard of in such situations , but the recent tendency has been for the Congress to forgive its prodigal sons.
   In 1949 the Dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against Harry_Truman , and in 1957 , after Congressman_Adam_Clayton_Powell campaigned for Dwight_Eisenhower in 1956 , his fellow Democrats did not touch his committee assignments , although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage.
   ( In the heat of the anti-Colmer drive last week , Judge_Smith threatened reprisal against Powell.
   Said he :  We will see whether whites and Negroes are treated the same around here .
 )   But Speaker_Sam_Rayburn , after huddling in Palm_Beach with President-elect_Kennedy , decided that this year something had to be done about the Rules_Committee - and that he was the only man who could do anything effective.
     In a tense , closed-door session with Judge_Smith , Rayburn attempted to work_out a compromise : to add three new members to the Rules_Committee ( two Democrats , including one Southerner , and one Republican ).
   Smith flatly rejected the offer , and Mister_Sam thereupon decided to join the rebels.
   The next morning he summoned a group of top Democrats to his private office and broke the news : he would lead the fight to oust Colmer , whom he is said to regard_as  an inferior man .
     News of Rayburn 's commitment soon leaked_out.
   When Missouri 's Clarence_Cannon got the word , he turned purple.
    Unconscionable !
 he shouted , and rushed_off to the Speaker 's Room to object :  A dangerous precedent !
   Cannon , a powerful , conservative man , brought welcome support to the Smith-Colmer forces : as chairman of the Appropriations_Committee , he holds_over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional_district from federal pork-barrel projects.
   Sitting quietly on an equally big pork_barrel was another Judge_Smith ally , Georgia 's Carl_Vinson , chairman of the Armed_Services Committee.
     As the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses , it became clear that Judge_Smith could lose.
   His highest count of supporters numbered 72 - and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260 - member Democratic caucus.
   The liberals , smelling blood , were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes - in the Democratic Committee on Committees , in the full party caucus , and on the floor of the House - before they could oust Colmer.
   ( One big question : If Colmer was to be purged , what should the House do about the other three senior Mississippians who supported the maverick electors?
 )   In_all three arenas , they seemed certain of victory - especially with Sam_Rayburn applying his whiplash.
     But in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war.
   If the Southerners were sufficiently aroused , they could very_well cut the Kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage_point of committee chairmanships , leaving Sam_Rayburn leading a truncated , unworkable party.
   With_that possibility in mind , Arkansas ' Wilbur_Mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the Committee on Committees , and coolheaded Democrats sought to bring Rayburn and Smith together again to work_out some sort_of face-saving compromise.
    Here are two old_men , mad at each other and too proud to pick_up the phone  , said a House Democratic leader.
    One wants a_little more power , and the other does n't want to give_up any .
     The Senate launched the 87 th Congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle , but in contrast with the House 's guerrilla war it seemed as pro_forma as a Capitol guide 's speech.
   Question at_issue : How big a vote should be necessary to restrict Senate debate - and thereby cut_off legislation-delaying filibusters?
     A wide-ranging , bipartisan force - from Minnesota 's Democratic Hubert_Humphrey to Massachusetts ' Republican_Leverett_Saltonstall - was drawn_up against a solid phalanx of Southern Democrats , who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil_rights bills.
   New_Mexico 's Clint_Anderson offered a resolution to change the Senate 's notorious Rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the Senators present and voting to cut_off debate , instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds.
   Fair_Dealer_Humphrey upped the ante , asked cloture power for a mere majority of Senators.
   Georgia 's Dick_Russell objected politely , and the battle was joined.
     Privately , the liberals admitted that the Humphrey amendment had no chance of passage.
   Privately , they also admitted that their hopes for Clint_Anderson 's three-fifths modification depended_on none other_than Republican_Richard_Nixon.
   In 1957 Nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of Senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new Congress , and that any rules laid_down by previous Congresses were not binding.
     Armed with the Nixon opinion , the Senate liberals rounded_up their slim majority and prepared to choke_off debate on the filibuster battle this week.
   Hopefully , the perennial battle of Rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once_and_for_all.
     Since Election_Day , Vice_President Richard_Nixon had virtually retired - by his own wish - from public view.
   But with the convening of the new Congress , he was the public man again , presiding over the Senate until John_Kennedy 's Inauguration.
   One_day last week , Nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of Congress to hear the official tally of the Electoral_College vote , and_then to make  sufficient declaration  of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election.
   Nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace , then went beyond the required  sufficient declaration .
      This is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in_which he was defeated  , he said.
    
    The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves.
   Gary_Player , the small , trim South_African , was the eventual winner , but in_all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap.
   Arnold_Palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72 nd hole after a_few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief.
      Just when you think you have it licked , this golf_course can get_up and bite you  , Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament.
   And that is just what happened on the last few holes.
   The Augusta_National Golf_Club Course got_up and bit both Player and Palmer.
     Player was the first to feel its teeth.
   After playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 - two strokes under par - on this fifth and final day of the tournament ( Sunday 's fourth round had been washed_out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed ) , Player 's game rapidly fell to pieces.
   He bogeyed the 10 th.
   After a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13 th.
   He bogeyed the 15 th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2 - over-par 74 and a 72 - hole total of 280.
     As he signed his scorecard and walked off the course , Player was almost in tears.
   He could read on the nearby scoreboard that Palmer , by then playing the 15 th hole , was leading him by a stroke.
   Palmer had started the round four strokes behind Player , and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as_many as six strokes.
   Now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf.
     When Palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72 nd hole , he seemed to have the championship won.
   But the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression.
   In trying to hit it out with a sand_wedge Palmer bounced the ball over the green , past spectators and down the slope toward a TV tower.
     Afterwards , Palmer told Charlie_Coe , his last-round partner , that he simply played the hole too fast.
   He did seem hasty on his second and third shots , but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while Coe graciously putted out , giving Palmer a chance to recover his composure , which he had quite visibly lost.
     When the shaken Palmer finally did hit his fourth shot , he overshot the hole by 15 feet.
   Palmer was now putting merely for a tie , and Player , who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in Tournament_Chairman_Clifford_Roberts ' clubhouse apartment , stared in amazement when Palmer missed the putt.
     Palmer 's 281 for the four rounds at Augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro , but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with Coe.
   The lean and leathery Oklahoma amateur , who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years , refused to let the Masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69.
     Until late last Saturday afternoon Palmer had played seven consecutive rounds_of_golf at the Masters - four last year and three this - without ever being out of first place.
   As evening approached and Palmer finished his Saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73 , this remarkable record was still intact , thanks to his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69.
   His three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score , a 213 by Bill_Collins , the tall and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing very_well all winter long.
     But Palmer knew , as did everybody else at Augusta , that his streak was about to be broken.
   Half an hour after he finished his round , Player holed_out at the 18 th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206 , four strokes ahead of Palmer.
     More_than a streak had ended.
   Long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on Sunday have become meteorological footnotes , the 1961 Masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between Arnold_Palmer and Gary_Player.
   Unlike most such sports rivalries , it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously , although this was not exactly the case.
     When the winter tour began at Los_Angeles last January there was no one in_sight to challenge Palmer 's towering prestige.
   As if to confirm his stature , he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments.
   Player won only one.
   But as the tour reached Pensacola a month ago , Player was leading Palmer in official winnings by a_few hundred dollars , and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere.
   On the final round at Pensacola , the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player in the same threesome and , although it was far from obvious at_the_time , the gallery was treated to the first chapter of_what promises to be one of the_most exciting duels in sport for a long_time to come.
     On_that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer nor Player was leading the tournament and , as it turned_out , neither won it.
   But whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour.
   Player immediately proved he was not in_the_least awed by the dramatic proximity of Palmer.
   He outplayed Palmer all_around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer 's 71.
   Thereafter , until the Masters , Player gradually increased his lead over Palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at Miami.
   When they reached Augusta last week , together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to_date.
     On Thursday , the first day of the Masters , the contest between Palmer and Player developed instantly.
   It was a dismal , drizzly day but a good one on_which to score over the Augusta_National course.
   The usually skiddy greens were moist and soft , so the golfers were able to strike their approach_shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too_much worry about the consequences.
   Palmer 's 4 - under-par 68 got him off to an early lead , which he shared with Bob_Rosburg.
   But Player was only one stroke back , with a 69.
     Even_so , it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators - unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever - that this tournament was to be , essentially , a match between Palmer and Player.
   A_lot_of people were still thinking_about Jack_Nicklaus , the spectacular young amateur , who had a 70 ; or Ken_Venturi , who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound_to do better ; or Rosburg , whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many_of Augusta 's treacheries ; or even old Byron_Nelson , whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf.
   ( On Thursday nobody except Charlie_Coe was thinking_of Charlie_Coe.
 )     On Friday , a day as cloudless and lovely as Thursday had been gray and ugly , the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus.
   Rosburg had started early in the day , and by the time Palmer and Player were on the course - separated , as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend , by about half an hour - they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that Rosburg , who ended with a 73 , was not having a good_day.
     As Player began his second round in a twosome with amateur Bill_Hyndman , his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender.
   Player began with a birdie on the first hole , added five straight pars and_then another birdie at the 9 th.
   On the back nine he began to acquire the tidal_wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament.
   He birdied the 13 th , the 15 th and the 18 th - five birdies , one bogey and 12 pars for a 68.
     Starting half an hour behind Player in company with British Open_Champion_Kel_Nagle , Palmer birdied the 2 nd , the 9 th , the 13 th and the 16 th - four birdies , one bogey and 13 pars for a 69.
   The roar of Palmer 's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of Augusta , only to be answered moments later by the roar of Player 's gallery for a similar triumph.
   At one point late in the day , when Palmer was lining_up a 25 - foot putt on the 16 th , a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18 th green unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the final hole.
   Without so_much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed ( although he later admitted that he had ) Palmer proceeded to sink his 25 - footer , and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in_reply.
     Anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under_way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf_course.
   It is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period_of_time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering_on violence.
   The bad_luck that can so often mar a well-played round_of_golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions.
   Bob_Jones played that way.
   Byron_Nelson did , Hogan did.
   And last week at the Masters_Palmer and Player did.
     As the third round of the tournament began on Saturday and the duel was resumed in_earnest , it was Player 's superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead.
   This day Palmer had started first.
   As Player stepped on the first tee he knew that Palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day.
   Player immediately proceeded to follow_suit.
   In_fact , he went_on to birdie the 6 th and 8 th as_well , to go 4 under par for the first eight holes.
     But Player 's real test came on the ninth hole , a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards.
   He hit a poor tee shot , pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9 th and first fairways.
   Having hit one of the trees , the ball came to rest not more_than 160 yards out.
   Player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9 th fairway and settling for a bogey 5 , or gambling.
   The latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse , hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9 th green.
      I was hitting the ball well  , Player said later ,  and I felt strong.
   When you 're playing like that you 'd better attack .
     Player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget.
   It struck the 9 th green on_the_fly and stopped just off the edge.
   From there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4.
     Palmer , meanwhile , had been having his troubles.
   They started on the 4 th hole , a 220 - yard par-3.
   On_this_day the wind had switched 180 ` from the northwest to the southeast , and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days.
   At the 4 th tee Palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club , so he put the ball in a bunker in_front of the green.
   His bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par.
     Starting the second nine , Palmer was already four strokes behind Player and knew it.
    
    When Mickey_Charles_Mantle , the New_York Yankees ' man of muscle , drives a home_run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the_sublime.
   When Roger_Eugene_Maris , Mantle 's muscular teammate , powers four home_runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe.
   But when tiny , 145 - pound Albert_Gregory_Pearson of the Los_Angeles Angels , who once caught three straight fly_balls in center field because , as a teammate explained ,  the other team thought no one was out there  , hits seven home_runs in four months ( three more_than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders_on the ridiculous.
   This is Baseball 1961.
   This is the year home_runs ranged from the_sublime to the ridiculous.
     It is the year when ( 1 ) amiable Jim_Gentile of the Baltimore_Orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and , in unprecedented style , delivered consecutive grand-slam home_runs ; ( 2 ) Willie_Mays of the San_Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate 's bat and became the ninth big_leaguer to stroke four home_runs in a game ; ( 3 ) the Milwaukee_Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home_runs in three games and lost two of them ; and ( 4 ) catcher Johnny_Blanchard of the New_York Yankees matched a record with home_runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitter.
     Pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats , the shrinking strike zone , and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal.
   Experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American_League caused by expansion.
   Whatever the reasons , not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records , home-run division.
     Of all the records in peril , one stands apart , dramatic in its making , dramatic in its endurance , and now , doubly dramatic in its jeopardy.
   This , of_course , is baseball 's most remarkable mark : The 60 home_runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure , the incredible athlete , George_Herman ( Babe ) Ruth of the Yankees.
     Since 1927 , fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at Babe_Ruth 's record and each , in_turn , has been thwarted.
   What ultimately frustrated every challenger was Ruth 's amazing September surge.
   In the final month of the 1927 season , he hit seventeen home_runs , a closing spurt never matched.
     Always , in the abortive attacks upon Ruth 's record , one man alone - a Jimmy_Foxx ( 58 in 1932 ) or a Hank_Greenberg ( 58 in 1938 ) or a Hack_Wilson ( 56 in 1930 ) - made the bid.
   But now , for_the_first_time since Lou_Gehrig ( with 47 home_runs ) spurred Ruth on in 1927 , two men playing for the same team have zeroed_in on 60.
   Their names are Mantle and Maris , their team is the Yankees , and their threat is real.
     After 108 games in 1927 , Ruth had 35 home_runs.
   After 108 games in 1961 , Mickey_Mantle has 43 , Roger_Maris 41.
   Extend Mantle 's and Maris 's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games , and , mathematically , each will hit more_than 60 home_runs.
   This is the great edge the two Yankees have going_for them.
   To better Ruth 's mark , neither needs a spectacular September flourish.
   All Mantle needs is eight more home_runs in August and ten in September , and he will establish a new record.
   In Ruth 's day - and until this year - the schedule was 154 games.
   Baseball commissioner Ford_Frick has ruled that Ruth 's record will remain official unless it is broken_in 154 games.
 )      Even on the basis of 154 games , this is the ideal situation  , insists Hank_Greenberg , now vice-president of the Chicago_White_Sox.
    It has_to be easier with two of them.
   How can you walk Maris to get_to Mantle ?
     Neither Mantle nor Maris , understandably , will predict 60 home_runs for himself.
   Although both concede they would like to hit 60 , they stick primarily to the baseball_player 's standard quote :  The important thing is to win the pennant .
   But one thing is for_certain : There is no dissension between Mantle , the American_League 's Most_Valuable_Player in 1956 and 1957 , and Maris , the MVP in 1960.
   Each enjoys seeing the other hit home_runs (  I hope Roger hits 80  , Mantle says ) , and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home_runs (  and I hope I hit 81  ).
     The sluggers get_along so well in_fact , that with their families at_home for the summer ( Mantle 's in Dallas , Maris 's in Kansas_City ) , they are rooming together.
   Mantle , Maris , and Bob_Cerv , a utility outfielder , share an apartment in Jamaica , Long_Island , not far from New_York International_Airport.
   The three pay $ 251 a month for four rooms ( kitchen , dining_room , living_room , and bedroom ) , with air-conditioning and new modern furniture.
   Mantle and Cerv use the twin_beds in the bedroom ; Maris sleeps on a green studio_couch in the living_room.
   They divide up the household chores : Cerv does most_of the cooking ( breakfast and sandwich snacks , with dinner out ) , Mantle supplies the transportation ( a white 1961 Oldsmobile convertible ) , and Maris drives the 25 - minute course from the apartment house to Yankee_Stadium.
   Mantle , Maris , and Cerv probably share one major-league record already : Among them , they have fifteen children - eight for Cerv , four for Mantle , and three for Maris.
     As roommates , teammates , and home-run mates , Mantle , 29 , who broke_in with the Yankees ten years ago , and Maris , 26 , who came to the Yankees from Kansas_City two years ago , have strikingly similar backgrounds.
   Both were scholastic stars in football , basketball , and baseball ( Mantle in Commerce , Okla. , Maris in Fargo , N. D.
 ) ; as halfbacks , both came_close to playing football at the University of Oklahoma (  Sometimes in the minors  , Maris recalls ,  I wished I had gone_to Oklahoma  ).
     To an extent , the two even look alike.
   Both have blue eyes and short blond hair.
   Both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds , but Mantle , incredibly muscular ( he has a 17 - 1 2 - inch neck ) , looks bigger.
   With their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders , both must have their clothes made to_order.
   Maris purchases $ 100 suits from Simpson 's in New_York.
   Mantle , more concerned with dress , buys his suits four at_a_time at Neiman-Marcus in Dallas and pays as much_as $ 250 each.
     Neither Mantle nor Maris need fear being classified an intellectual , but lately Mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus , Henry_Miller 's  Tropic_of_Cancer .
   Mantle so appreciated Miller 's delicate literary style that he broadened teammates ' minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips.
     Mantle is not normally given to public_speaking - or , for_that_matter , to private speaking.
    What do you and Mickey talk_about at_home ?
 a reporter asked Maris recently.
      To tell you the truth  , Maris said ,  Mickey do n't talk much .
     This is no surprising trait for a ballplayer.
   What is surprising and pleasant is that Mantle and Maris , under constant pressure from writers and photographers , are trying to be cooperative.
     Of the two , Mantle is by nature the less outgoing , Maris the more outspoken.
   But last week , when a reporter was_standing near Mantle 's locker , Mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote.
    See that kid ?
 he said , pointing to a dark-haired 11 - year-old boy.
    That 's [ Yogi ] Berra 's.
   I 'll never forget one_time I struck_out three_times , dropped a fly_ball , and we lost the game.
   I came_back , sitting by my locker , feeling real low , and the kid walks over to me , looks up , and says :   ' You stunk  '.
     Maris , in talking to reporters , tries to answer all questions candidly and fully , but on rare occasions , he shuns newsmen.
    When I 've made a dumb play  , he says ,  I do n't want to talk to anyone.
   I 'm angry .
     By his own confession , Maris is an angry young_man.
   Benched at Tulsa in 1955 , he told manager Dutch Meyer :    I can n't play for you.
   Send me where I can play .
   ( Meyer sent him to Reading , Pa..
 )   Benched at Indianapolis in 1956 , he told manager Kerby_Farrell :  I 'm not learning anything on the bench.
   Play me .
   ( Farrell did - and Maris led the team to victory in the Little World_Series.
 )    That 's the way I am  , he says.
    I tell people what I think.
   If you 're a good ballplayer , you 've got_to get mad.
   Give me a team of nine angry men and I 'll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we 'll beat you nine out of ten times .
     One good indication of the two men 's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes.
   Maris 's was Ted_Williams.
    When I was a kid  , Maris told a sportswriter last week ,  I used_to follow Williams every_day in the box score , just to see whether he got a hit or not .
      When you came_up to the majors , did you seek_out Williams for advice ?
      Are you kidding ?
 said Maris.
    You 're afraid to talk to a guy you idolize .
     Mantle 's hero was Joe_DiMaggio.
    When Mickey went to the Yankees  , says Mark_Freeman , an ex-Yankee pitcher who sells mutual_funds in Denver ,  DiMaggio still was playing and every_day Mickey would go_by his locker , just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man , this hero of his.
   But DiMaggio never said a word.
   It crushed Mickey.
   He told me he vowed right_then that if he ever got_to be a star , this never would be said of him .
   Mantle has kept the vow.
   Among all the Yankees , he is the veteran most friendly to rookies.
     Neither Mantle nor Maris is totally devoted_to baseball above_all else.
   If laying ties on a railroad_track , which he once did for $ 1 an hour , paid more_than playing right field for the Yankees , Maris would lay ties on a railroad_track.
   If working in a zinc mine , which he once did for 87 - 1 2 cents an hour , paid more_than playing center field for the Yankees , Mantle would work in a zinc mine.
   But since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts , Mantle and Maris concentrate_on baseball.
   They try to play baseball the best they can.
     Each is a complete ballplayer.
   Mantle , beyond any question , can do more things well.
   (  One of the reasons they get_along fine  , says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men ,  is that both realize Mantle is head-and-shoulders above Maris .
 )   Hitting , Mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed , Maris only left-handed.
   They both possess near classic stances , dug_in firmly , arms high , set for fierce swings.
   Mantle is considerably better hitting for average (.
332 , fourth in the league , to.
280 for Maris so_far this year ).
     Both are good bunters : Maris once beat_out eighteen of nineteen in the minor_leagues ; Mantle is a master at dragging_a_bunt toward first_base.
   Both have brilliant speed : Mantle was timed from home_plate ( batting left-handed ) to first_base in 3.1 seconds , faster than any other major_leaguer ; Maris ran the 100 - yard dash in ten seconds in high_school and once won a race against Luis_Aparicio , the swift , base-stealing shortstop of the White_Sox.
   Both are good , daring fielders : Mantle covers more ground ; Maris 's throwing arm is stronger.
     Yet with all their skills , the appeal of Mantle and Maris in 1961 comes_down to one basic : The home_run.
   With this ultimate weapon , the two Yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season.
   ( American_League expansion created , inevitably , weaker teams.
   Only two teams in each league [ the Yankees and Detroit , the Dodgers and Cincinnati ] are battling for first place.
     Appropriately , the emphasis on the home_run , at a peak this year , came_into_being at baseball 's lowest moment.
   In 1920 , as the startling news that the 1919 White_Sox had conspired to lose the World_Series leaked_out , fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball.
   Something was needed to revive interest ; the something was the home_run.
    
    Into Washington on President-elect_John_F._Kennedy 's Convair , the Caroline , winged Actor-Crooner_Frank_Sinatra and his close Hollywood pal , Cinemactor_Peter_Lawford , Jack_Kennedy 's brother-in-law.
   Also included in the entourage : a dog in a black sweater , Frankie and Peter had an urgent mission : to stage a mammoth Inauguration_Eve entertainment gala in the capital 's National_Guard Armory.
   Frankie was fairly glutted with ideas , as he had hinted upon his arrival :  It 's really tremendous when you think Ella_Fitzgerald is coming from Australia.
   I could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all_of our plans !
   As the plans were laid , some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced in the armory 's $ 100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced at $ 10000 each.
   The biggest single act would doubtless be staged by Frankie himself : his Inaugural wardrobe had been designed by Hollywood_Couturier_Don_Loper , who regularly makes_up ladies ' ensembles.
   Soon after Loper leaked the news that Frankie had ordered  two of everything  just  in_case he spills anything  , Frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch of Loper clothing.
     A year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the Marine_Corps , General_David_M._Shoup delivered a peppery annual report in the form of a  happy , warless New_Year  greeting to his Pentagon staff.
   Said Leatherneck_Shoup :  A year ago I took the grips of the plow in my hands.
   After pushing an accumulation of vines and weeds from the moldboard , I lifted the lines from the dust and found hitched to_that plow the finest team I ever held a rein on.
   Little geeing and hawing have been necessary .
   But Shoup also gave the Corps a tilling in_spots.
   Speaking of  pride  , he deplored the noncommissioned_officer  whose uniform looks_like it belonged_to someone who retired in 1940 ; the officer with the yellow socks or the bay_window.
   A_few of these people are still around .
     Old and new briefly crossed paths in the U._S._Senate , then went their respective ways.
   At a reception for new members of Congress , Oregon_Democrat_Maurine_Neuberger , taking the Senate seat held by her husband Richard until his death last March , got a brotherly buss from Democratic Elder_Statesman Adlai_Stevenson , U._S._Ambassador-designate to the U._N..
   Meanwhile , after 24 years in the Senate , Rhode_Island 's durable Democrat_Theodore_Francis_Greene - having walked , swum and cerebrated himself to the hearty age of 93 - left that august body ( voluntarily , because he could surely have been re-elected had he chosen to run again last November ) , as the oldest man ever to serve in the Senate.
     The_most famous undergraduate of South_Philadelphia High_School is a current bobby-sox idol , Dreamboat_Cacophonist_Fabian ( real name : Fabian_Forte ) , 17 , and last week it developed that he will remain an undergraduate for_a_while.
   The principal of the school announced that - despite the help of private tutors in Hollywood and Philadelphia - Fabian is a 10 - o ' clock scholar in English and mathematics.
   Lacking his needed credits in those subjects , Fabian will not graduate with his old classmates next week.
   South_Philadelphia_High 's principal added that the current delay was caused by the  pressure  of a movie that the toneless lad was making.
     To Decathlon Man Rafer_Johnson ( Time cover , Aug. 29 ) , whose gold medal in last summer 's Olympic_Games was won as much on gumption as talent , went the A._A._U.

   As the world 's top sportsman - pro or amateur - Sports Illustrated tapped golf 's confident Arnold_Palmer ( Time cover , May 2 ) , who staged two cliffhanging rallies to win both the Masters and U._S._Open crowns , went_on to win a record $ 80738 for the year.
     Tooling through Sydney on his way to race in the New_Zealand Grand_Prix , Britain 's balding Ace_Driver_Stirling_Moss , 31 , all_but smothered himself in his own exhaust of self-crimination.
    I 'm a slob  , he announced.
    My taste is gaudy.
   I 'm useless for_anything but racing_cars.
   I 'm ruddy lazy , and I 'm getting_on in years.
   It gets so frustrating , but then_again I do n't know what I could do if I gave_up racing .
   Has Moss no stirling virtues?
    I appreciate beauty .
     One of Nikita_Khrushchev 's most enthusiastic eulogizers , the U._S._S. R.
 's daily Izvestia , enterprisingly interviewed Red-prone Comedian Charlie_Chaplin at his Swiss villa , where he has been in self-exile since 1952.
   Chaplin , 71 , who met K. when the Soviet boss visited England in 1956 , confided that he hopes to visit Russia some time this summer because  I have marveled at your grandiose experiment and I believe_in your future .
   Then Charlie spooned out some quick impressions of the Nikita he had glimpsed :  I was captivated by his humor , frankness and good_nature and by his kind , strong and somewhat sly face .
     G._David_Thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in Europe 's best hotels , but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of Pittsburgh.
   There the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth , a reputation for eccentricity , and an ardor for collecting art.
   Last week , in the German city of Du ^ sseldorf , G._David_Thompson was making headlines that could well give Pittsburgh pause.
   On display were 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection - and every single one of them was up for_sale.
     Like Philadelphia 's late Dr._Albert_C._Barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public ( Time , Jan. 2 ) , Thompson , at 61 , is something of a legend in his own lifetime.
   He made his fortune during World_War 2 , when he took_over a_number_of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom.
   Even before he hit big money , he had begun buying modern paintings.
   He gave the impression of never having read a word about art , but there was no_doubt that he had an eye for the best.
     He was able to smell a bargain - and a masterpiece - a continent away , and the Museum of Modern_Art 's Alfred_Barr said of him :  I have never mentioned a new artist that Thompson did n't know about .
   He might barge into a gallery , start haggling over prices without so_much as a word of greeting.
   He could be lavishly generous with friends , cab drivers and bellboys , but with dealers he was tough.
   He bought_up Cezannes , Braques , Matisses , Legers , a splendid Picasso series , more_than 70 Giacometti sculptures.
   He gathered one of the biggest collections of Paul_Klees in the world.
   All these he hung in his burglarproof home called Stone 's_Throw , outside Pittsburgh , and only people he liked and trusted ever got_to see them.
     Two years ago Thompson offered his collection to the city.
   But he insisted that it be housed in a special museum.
   Pittsburgh turned him down , just_as Pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years.
   He went then to a 40 - year-old Basel art_dealer named Ernst_Beyeler , with whom he had long been trading pictures.
   Last year Beyeler arranged to sell $ 1500000 worth of Klees to the state of North_Rhine-Westphalia , which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built.
   Last week most_of the other prizes , once offered to Pittsburgh , went on the block.
     At the opening of the Du ^ sseldorf show , Thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time.
   In_fact he seemed delighted to get_rid_of them.
   Some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town.
   Thompson himself said :  I want to enjoy once_more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures .
     The University of Georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color.
   But in_all its 175 years , not a single Negro student has entered its classrooms.
   Last week Federal_District Judge_William_A._Bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a  qualified  Negro boy and girl.
   Their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education , from kindergarten through graduate_school , in Georgia - and in Alabama , Mississippi and South_Carolina as_well.
     For 18 months , Hamilton_Holmes , 19 , and Charlayne_Hunter , 18 , had tried to get_into the university.
   They graduated together from Atlanta 's Turner High_School , where Valedictorian_Holmes was first in the class and Charlayne third.
   The university rejected them on a variety of pretexts , but was careful never to mention the color of their skins.
   Holmes went_to Atlanta 's Morehouse ( Negro ) College , where he is a B + student and star halfback.
   Charlayne studied journalism at Detroit 's Wayne_State_University.
   Last fall , after they took their hopes for entering Georgia to court , Judge_Bootle ordered them to apply again.
     Charlayne was  tentatively  admitted for next fall , after state investigators questioned her white roommate at Wayne_State.
   But Holmes was rejected again  on the basis of his record and interview .
   The evidence in court was testimony about the interview , which for Holmes lasted an hour , although at_least one white student at Georgia got_through this ritual by a simple phone conversation.
   Holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house_of_prostitution , or a  beatnik parlor or teahouse .
   No , said he , but officials still called him  evasive .
   They also said he lied in saying that he had never been  arrested .
   Their reason : Holmes once paid a $ 20 speeding fine , had his license suspended.
     Negro lawyers dug_into the records of 300 white students , found that many were hardly interviewed at_all - and few had academic records as_good_as Hamilton_Holmes.
   The real reason for his rejection , they argued , is the fact that Georgia law automatically cuts_off funds for any desegregated school.
     Judge_Bootle 's decision :  The two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color .
   The state will appeal - but few think it will actually try to close the university.
    Surprised and pleased  , Students Holmes and Hunter may enter the University of Georgia this week.
     When the University of Chicago 's Chancellor_Lawrence_A._Kimpton submitted his resignation last March , a mighty talent hunt gripped the Midway.
   Out went letters to 60000 old grads , asking for suggestions.
   Such academic statesmen as James_B._Conant were consulted.
   Two committees pondered 375 possible Kimpton successors , including Adlai_Stevenson , Richard_Nixon , and Harvard 's Dean_McGeorge_Bundy.
   The debate led to a decision that Chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic_administrator , but rather , as Trustee_Chairman_Glen_A._Lloyd put it ,  a top scholar in his own right  - a bright light to lure other top scholars to Chicago.
     Last week Chicago happily found its top scholar in Caltech 's acting dean of the faculty : dynamic Geneticist_George_Wells_Beadle , 57 , who shared the 1958 Nobel_Prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry ( Time , Cover , July_14 , 1958 ).
     It fell to Chancellor_Kimpton , now a Standard_Oil ( Indiana ) executive , to spend his nine-year reign tidying_up Chicago after the 21 - year typhoon of Idealist Robert_Maynard_Hutchins.
   He threw_out some of Hutchins ' more wildly experimental courses , raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2100 , nearly doubled endowment to $ 139.3 million.
   But though Kimpton put Chicago in_what he felt was working order , some old grads feel that it still needs the kind_of lively teachers who filled it in the heady Hutchins era.
     At Caltech , Geneticist_Beadle has stuck close_to his research as head of the school 's famous biology division since 1946.
   But he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot , recruit and excite able researchers , and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speech-making.
   Beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters ; he avidly reads the Wall_Street Journal , and took delight in driving a $ 250 model A Ford for 22 years , then selling it for $ 300.
    
    A philosopher may point_out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end.
   But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold_out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass_away.
   The man was King_Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had_better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good.
   By force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900000 square_miles of wilderness in Central_Africa.
   This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity.
   Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; they were determined by the points at which Leopold 's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking.
     The population of the Congo is 13.5 million , divided into at_least seven major  culture clusters  and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects.
   The religions of the people include Christianity , Mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor_worship and animism.
   The climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate.
   The hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run_over by sports_cars.
   To make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in_any_case ; it has been made far more difficult by what the Belgians have done , or failed to do , in the Congo since 1885.
     At_first the Belgian royal_family administered the Congo as its own private_property.
   But by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience.
   The Belgian government itself took_over administration , commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism.
   One definition of paternalism is  The principle or practice , on the part of a government , of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children .
   The honor of the Belgians in_this matter is not to be questioned - only their judgment.
   Ordinarily a father permits his children to grow_up in_due_time - but when the colony received independence in 1960 the Congolese child , if one imagines him to have been_born in 1908 , was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant.
     The Belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the Congo , which is rich_in copper , tin , cobalt , manganese , zinc , and uranium , and cotton and palm_oil.
   The colony was administered from Brussels , with neither the Congolese nor the resident Belgians having any vote.
   The beneficiaries of_this administration were a_number_of huge cartels in_which both individuals and the Belgian government itself held stock.
   In Inside Africa , John_Gunther describes one of these , the Societe_Generale , as  the kind_of colossus that might be envisaged if , let us say , the House of Morgan , Anaconda Copper , the Mutual Life_Insurance Company of New_York , the Pennsylvania_Railroad , and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together , with the United_States_government as a heavy partner .
     Had they been truly ruthless , the Belgians might have exploited the Congolese without compassion.
   But they were not.
   They provided a social_security system which covered all their African employes ; their program of mass medical_care was doubtless the best on the continent ; they put much effort into public housing.
   They also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the Congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food.
   But instead of delivering the ration - either in actual commodities or in cash - at intervals of perhaps two_weeks or a month , the Belgians felt obliged to dole it out more_often.
   Would not the children , if they received all their food on the first day_of_the_month , eat it up immediately , and later go_hungry?
     The Belgians also placed great emphasis on education.
   During the 1950 s there were as_many as 25000 schools in the Congo.
   But almost all the schools were primary.
   The average Congolese can do little more_than puzzle_out the meaning of  la chatte  and  le chien  and write his name.
   Some schools were technical - the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and trained many.
   But they did not believe_in widespread secondary education , much less in college.
   It was their conviction that the people should be  brought_up together  , a grade at_a_time , until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history , economics and political_science.
   Indeed , the Belgians discouraged higher education , fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest.
   When the Congo received its independence in 1960 there were , among its 13.5 million people , exactly 14 university graduates.
     Why did the Belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it?
   In one large oversimplification , it might be said that the Belgians felt , far too late , the gale of nationalism sweeping Africa.
   They lacked time to prepare the Congo , as the_British and French had prepared their colonies.
   The Congolese were clamoring for their independence , even_though most were unsure what it meant ; and in Brussels , street crowds shouted ,  Pas une goutte de sang!
    ( Not_one drop of blood!
 )  .
   The Belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue ; rather_than teach where teaching was not wanted , they would wash_their_hands of the mess.
   It is hard to blame them for this.
   Yet there were other motivations and actions which the Belgians took after independence for which history may_not find them guiltless.
     As the time for independence approached there were in the Congo no_fewer_than 120 political_parties , or approximately eight for each university graduate.
   There were four principal ones.
   First , there were those Congolese ( among them Joseph_Kasavubu ) who favored splitting the country into small independent states , Balkanizing it.
   Second , there were those ( Moise_Tshombe ) who favored near-Balkanization , a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority , with much power residing in the states.
   Third , there were those ( notably Patrice_Lumumba ) who favored a unified Congo with a very strong central government.
   And fourth , there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew_up.
   However , the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting.
     A final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the Congo , immediately after independence , was the provincial structure that had been established by the Belgians for convenience in administration.
   They had divided the Congo into six provinces - Leopoldville , Kasai , Kivu , Katanga , Equator and Eastern - unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings.
   Thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other , and to them independence meant an opportunity for war.
     The Belgian_Congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable Western-style form_of_government :   there were to be a president and a premier , and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces.
   Well-wishers around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations.
   If internal frictions arose , they could be handled by the 25000 - man Congolese army , the Force_Publique , which had been trained and was still officered by white Belgians.
   The president , Joseph_Kasavubu , seemed an able administrator and the premier , Patrice_Lumumba , a reasonable man.
     Twenty-four_hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other.
   Presently the well-armed members of the Force_Publique - many_of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes , erupted in mutiny , rioting , raping and looting.
   Terror engulfed the thousands of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country.
   The Belgian government decided to act , and on July 10 dispatched paratroops to the Congo.
   On July 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of Katanga , Moise_Tshombe , announced that his province had seceded from the country.
   Confusion became chaos ; each succeeding day brought new acts of violence.
   Lumumba and Kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the Belgians , and appealed_to the United_Nations to send troops to oust them.
     On July_14 the Security_Council - with France and Great_Britain abstaining - voted the resolution which drew the U._N. into the Congo.
   Vague in wording , it called_for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the Secretary-General  to take the necessary steps to provide the [ Congolese ] Government with such military assistance as may be necessary , until , through the efforts of the Congolese_Government with the technical assistance of the United_Nations , the national security_forces may be able , in the opinion of the Government , to meet fully their tasks .
     Secretary-General_Hammarskjo ^ ld decided that it would be preferable if the U._N. troops sent into the Congo were to come from African , or at_least nonwhite , nations - certainly not from the U._S. , Russia , Great_Britain or France.
   He quickly called_on Ghana , Tunisia , Morocco , Guinea and Mali , which dispatched troops within hours.
   Ultimately the U._N. army in the Congo reached a top strength of 19000 , including about 5000 from India and a_few soldiers from Eire and Sweden , who were the only whites.
     It took the U._N. three months to bring a modest form of order to the Congo.
   The Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed U._N. efforts.
   The wildly erratic nature of Patrice_Lumumba caused constant problems - he frequently announced that he wanted the U._N. to get_out of the Congo along with the Belgians , and appealed_to Russia for help.
   ( However , there is little evidence that the late Lumumba was a Communist.
   Before appealing_to the U._N. or to Russia , he first appealed_to the U._S. for military help , and was rejected.
 )   Lumumba further complicated the U. N.
 's mission by initiating small  wars  with the secessionist province of Katanga and with South_Kasai which , under Albert_Kalonji , wanted to secede as_well.
   Meanwhile Russia took every opportunity to meddle in the Congo , sending Lumumba equipment for his  wars  , dispatching  technicians  and even threatening , on_occasion , to intervene openly.
     But by the end of the three-month period , in October 1960 , something approaching calm settled on the Congo.
   President_Kasavubu became exasperated with Lumumba and fired him.
   Lumumba fired Kasavubu.
   Control of the government - such control as there was and such government as there was - passed into the hands of Joseph_Mobutu , chief_of_staff of the Congolese army.
   Mobutu promptly flung_out the Russians , who have not since played any significant part on the local scene , although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at U._N. headquarters in New_York.
   The Belgians - at_least officially - departed from the Congo as_well , withdrawing all_of their uniformed troops.
   But they left behind them large_numbers of officers , variously called  volunteers  or  mercenaries  , who now staff the army of Moise_Tshombe in Katanga , the seceded province which , according to Tshombe , holds 65 % of the mineral wealth of the entire country.
     From October 1960 to February 1961 , the U._N. forces in the Congo took little action.
   There was no directive for it - the Security_Council 's resolution had not mentioned political matters , and in_any_case the United_Nations by the terms of its charter may_not interfere in the political affairs of any nation , whether to unify it , federalize it or Balkanize it.
     During the five-month lull , civil_war smoldered and flickered throughout the Congo.
   In February the murder of Patrice_Lumumba , who had been kidnaped into Katanga and executed on order of Tshombe , again stirred the U._N. to action.
   On Feb. 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of  all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil_war in the Congo , including the use of force , if necessary , in the last_resort .
   Although the resolution might have been far more specific , it was considerably tougher than the earlier one.
   It also urged that the U._N. eject , and prevent the return of , all Belgian and other foreign military and political advisers ; ordered an investigation of Lumumba 's death ; urged the reconvention of the Congolese_Parliament and the reorganization of the army.
    
    Though President_John_F._Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy 's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance_on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U._S. foreign_policy last week.
     High_up on the President 's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte.
   On this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U._N._Ambassador_Adlai_Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr._Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way - for both Paris and Tunis - out of the imbroglio.
   Ideally , the President would like the_French to agree on a  status_quo ante  on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base.
   To continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr._Kennedy invited stevenson to Cape_Cod for the weekend.
     The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian_Government , Defense_Minister_Bahi_Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U._S. support.
   The conversation apparently convinced Mr._Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable.
   Through Ladgham , Mr._Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian_President_Habib_Bourguiba ; and one U._S. official said :    The key question now is which side picks_up the phone first .
     On the Latin_American front , the President held talks with Secretary of the Treasury_Douglas_Dillon before sending him to Uruguay and the Inter-American Economic_and_Social_Council ( which the President himself had originally hoped to attend ).
   Main purpose of the meeting : To discuss President_Kennedy 's Alliance for Progress.
     And that was not all.
   In conferences with Nationalist_China 's dapper , diminutive Vice_President Chen_Cheng , Mr._Kennedy assured Chiang_Kai-shek 's emissary that the U._S. is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of Red_China to the United_Nations.
   Chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of Outer_Mongolia ; however the President , who would like to woo the former Chinese province away from both Peking and Moscow , would promise Chen nothing more_than an abstention by the U._S. if Outer_Mongolia 's admission comes to a vote.
     The President also conferred_with emissaries from Guatemala and Nepal who are seeking more foreign aid.
   To Africa , he sent his most trusted adviser , his brother , Attorney_General Robert_Kennedy , on a good-will mission to the Ivory_Coast.
   All week long the President clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs ; in_effect , he was practicing what he preached in his Berlin message two_weeks ago when he declared :  We shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk , and listen , with_reason .
     From International_Airport in Los_Angeles to International_Airport in Houston , as the great four-jet Boeing 707 flies , is a routine five hours and 25 minutes , including stopovers at Phoenix , El_Paso , and San_Antonio.
   When Continental Airlines night-coach Flight 54 took_off at 11 : 30 one night last week , there was no reason to think it would take any longer.
     The plane put_down on schedule at 1 : 35 a. m. in Phoenix.
   Thirty-one minutes later , when it took_off for El_Paso , hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard.
   At 3 : 58 a. m. , with the plane about twenty minutes out of El_Paso , passenger Robert_Berry , a San_Antonio advertising man , glanced up and saw the man and boy , accompanied by a stewardess , walking up the aisle toward the cockpit.
    The man was bent_over with his hand on his stomach  , Berry said.
    I figured he was sick .
     John_Salvador , a farmer from Palm_Desert , Calif. , was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit.
    The kid had a.
45 automatic , like they issue in the Army  , he said.
    The other fellow had a.
38 .
   Salvador saw the youth hold his.
45 against the head of stewardess Lois_Carnegey ; the man put his.
38 at the head of Capt._Byron_D._Rickards.
     To Rickards , a 52 - year-old veteran 30 years in_the_air , it was an old story : His plane was being hijacked in mid-flight again much_as it had happened in 1930 , when Peruvian rebels made him land a Ford tri-motor at Arequipa.
   But last week 's pirates , like the Cuban-American who recently hijacked an Eastern Airlines Electra ( Newsweek , Aug. 7 ) , wanted to go to Havana.
      Tell your company there are four of us here with guns  , the elder man told Rickards.
   The pilot radioed El_Paso_International_Airport with just that message.
   But , he told the  skyjackers  , the 707 did n't carry enough fuel to reach Havana ; they would have to refuel at El_Paso.
     Most passengers did n't know what had happened until they got on the ground.
   Jerry_McCauley of Sacramento , Calif. , one of some twenty Air_Force recruits on_board , awoke from a nap in confusion.
    The old_man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to Cuba  , McCauley said ,  and like a nut I raised my hand.
   I thought he was the Air_Force recruiter .
     What the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages , along with the crew.
   They chose four :   Jack_Casey , who works for Continental Airlines in Houston ; Fred_Mullen from Mercer_Island , Wash. ; Pfc._Truman_Cleveland of St._Augustine.
   Fla. , and Leonard_Gilman , a former college boxer and veteran of the U._S._Immigration_Service Border_Patrol.
   Everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched_down at El_Paso at 4 : 18 a. m..
     They found a large welcoming group - El_Paso policemen , Border_Patrol , sheriff 's deputies , and FBI men , who surged around the plane with rifles and submarine guns.
   Other FBI men , talking with the pilot from the tower , conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to Havana.
   The ground_crew , which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes , took fully three hours.
   Still more time was consumed while the pilot , at the radioed suggestion of Continental president Robert Six , tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the Boeing jet for a propeller-driven Douglas_DC-7.
     Actually , the officers on_the_ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get_away with any kind_of an airplane ; they had orders to_that_effect straight from President_Kennedy , who thought at_first , as did most others , that it was four followers of Cuba 's Fidel_Castro who had taken_over the 707.
   Mr._Kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane , kept in touch throughout by telephone.
   At_one_time , while still under the impression that he was dealing with a Cuban plot , the President talked_about invoking a total embargo on trade with Cuba.
     As the morning wore_on and a blazing West_Texas sun wiped the shadows off the Franklin Mountains , police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment.
   From the luggage , they learned that the two air pirates , far from being Cubans , were native_Americans , subsequently identified as Leon_Bearden , 50 - year-old ex-convict from Coolidge , Ariz. , and his son , Cody , 16 , a high-school junior.
     The heat and strain began to tell_on the Beardens.
   The father , by_accident or perhaps to show , as he said ,  we mean_business  , took the.
45 and fired a slug between the legs of Second Officer_Norman_Simmons.
   At 7 : 30 a. m. , more_than three hours after landing , the Beardens gave an ultimatum :     Take_off or see the hostages killed.
     The tower cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a. m. , and Captain_Rickards began taxiing toward the runway.
     Several police_cars , loaded with armed officers , raced alongside , blazing_away at the tires of the big jet.
   The slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines ; the plane slowed to a halt.
   Ambulances , baggage trucks , and cars surrounded it.
     The day wore_on.
   At 12 : 50 p. m. a ramp was rolled up to the plane.
   A_few minutes later , FBI_agent Francis_Crosby , talking fast , eased_up the ramp to the plane , unarmed.
   While Crosby distracted the Beardens , stewardesses Carnegey and Toni_Besset dropped out of a rear door.
   So did hostages Casey , Cleveland , and Mullen.
   That left only the four crew_members , Crosby , and Border_Patrolman Gilman , all unarmed , with the Beardens.
   The elder Bearden had one pistol in his hand , the other in a hip_pocket.
   Gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance.
   He caught officer Simmons ' eye , nodded toward young Bearden , and -  I swung my right as hard as I could.
   Simmons and Crosby jumped the boy and it was all_over .
     Frog-marched off the airplane at 1 : 48 p. m. , the Beardens were held in bail of $ 100000 each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state_lines.
   ( Bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to Castro , and live high in Cuba.
 )   Back home in Coolidge , Ariz. , his 36 - year-old wife , Mary , said :    I thought they were going to Phoenix to look_for jobs .
     Taking precedence over all other legislation on Capitol_Hill last week was the military strength of the nation.
   The Senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass - 85 to 0 - the largest peacetime defense budget in U._S. history.
     With the money all_but in_hand , however , the Administration indicated that , instead of the 225000 more men in uniform that President_Kennedy had requested , the armed_forces would be increased by only 160000.
   The  hold-back  , as Pentagon mutterers labeled it , apparently was a temporary_expedient intended to insure that the army services are built_up gradually and , thus , the new funds spent prudently.
     In_all , the Senate signed a check for $ 46.7 billion , which not_only included the extra $ 3.5 billion requested the week before by President_Kennedy , but tacked_on $ 754 million more_than the President had asked for.
   ( The Senate , on its own , decided to provide additional B-52 and other long-range bombers for the Strategic_Air_Command.
 )   The House , which had passed its smaller appropriation before the President 's urgent call for more , was expected to go_along with the increased defense budget in_short_order.
     In other areas , Congressional action last week included :     The Senate ( by voice vote ) and the House ( by 224 - 170 ) passed and sent to the White_House the compromise farm_bill which the President is expected to sign , not too unhappily.
     The Senate also voted $ 5.2 billion to finance the government 's health , welfare , and labor activities.
     Debate on the all-important foreign-aid bill , with its controversial long-range proposals , had just begun on the Senate floor at the weekend.
   White_House legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact.
     Most members of the U._S._Senate , because they are human , like to eat as high on the hog as they can.
   But , because they are politicians , they like to talk as poor-mouth as the lowliest voter.
   As a result , ever since 1851 when the Senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the Capitol_Building , the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food - even while they opposed every move that might improve it.
     Over the years , enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of Maine and Idaho potatoes , the menu has pursued its drab all-American course.
   Individual senators , with an eye to the voters back home , occasionally introduced smelts from Michigan , soft-shell_crabs from Maryland , oysters from Washington , grapefruit from Florida.
   But plain old bean soup , served daily since the turn_of_the_century ( at the insistence of the late Sen._Fred_Dubois of Idaho ) , made clear to the citizenry that the Senate 's stomach was in the right place.
     In a daring stroke , the Senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a $ 10000 - per-year French-born maitre d ' hotel.
    
    Holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes.
     Long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward.
   Higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues.
     Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded_as highly speculative.
     Things are looking_up these days for many_of the State turnpikes on_which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds.
     traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing.
   That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates.
     As a result of the new outlook for turnpikes , investors who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments.
     Another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds.
     Other tax-exempt bonds of State and local_governments hit a price peak on February 21 , according to Standard + Poor 's average.
   On balance , prices of those bonds have slipped a_bit since then.
   However , in the same three-month period , toll-road bonds , as_a_group , have bucked this trend.
   On these bonds , price rises since February 21 easily outnumber price declines.
     Investors , however , still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bonds.
   You find the evidence of_that in the chart on this page.
     Many_of the toll-road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per_cent , or very close_to that.
   And this is true in the case of some turnpikes on_which revenues have risen close_to , or beyond , the point at which the roads start to pay all operating_costs plus annual interest on the bonds.
     That 4 per_cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds.
   It 's not_much more , in_fact , than the return that is offered on U._S. Treasury_bonds.
     For investors whose income is taxed at high rates , though , a tax-free yield of 4 per_cent is high.
   It is the equivalent of 8 per_cent for an unmarried investor with more_than $ 16000 of income to be taxed , or for a married_couple with more_than $ 32000 of taxed income.
     A new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the_most recent 12 - month period - ending in February or March - shows what is happening.
   The report is based on a survey by Blyth + Company , investment_bankers.
     Nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period.
     And there is the bright note : The gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession.
   Many_of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter.
     Indication : The long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward.
     Look , for_example , at the Ohio_Turnpike.
   Traffic on_that road slumped sharply in January and February , as compared with those same months in 1960.
   Then March brought an 18 per_cent rise in net revenues - after operating_costs.
     As a result , the road 's net revenues in the 12 months ending March 31 were 186 per_cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds.
   That was up from 173 per_cent in the preceding 12 months.
     That same pattern of earnings shows_up on the Massachusetts_Turnpike.
   Operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 , but up for the 12 months ending in March.
   Costs were held down , despite a bitter winter.
     For the year , the road earned 133 per_cent of its interest costs , against 121 per_cent in the preceding period.
   The road 's engineers look_for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into Boston.
     Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do.
   The 187 - mile Illinois_State Toll Highway , for_example , was not opened over its entire length until December , 1958.
   In the 12 months ended in February , 1960 , the highway earned enough to cover 64 per_cent of its interest load - with the remainder paid_out of initial reserves.
   In the 12 months ended in February , 1961 , this highway earned 93 per_cent of its interest.
     That improvement is continuing.
   In the first two months of 1961 , earnings of the Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per_cent from early 1960.
     Success , for many turnpikes , has come hard.
   Traffic frequently has failed to measure_up to engineers ' rosy estimates.
   In these cases , the turnpike managements have had to turn_to toll-rate increases , or to costly improvements such_as extensions or better connections with other highways.
     Many rate increases already have been put into effect.
   Higher tolls are planned for July_1 , 1961 , on the Richmond-Petersburg , Va. , Turnpike , and proposals for increased tolls on the Texas_Turnpike are under study.
     Progress is being made , too , in improving motorists ' access to many turnpikes.
   The Kansas_Turnpike offers an illustration.
   Net earnings of_that road rose from 62 per_cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per_cent in the 12 months ended Feb. 28 , 1961.
     Further improvements in earnings of the Kansas_Turnpike are expected late in 1961 , with the opening of a new bypass at Wichita , and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both Kansas_City , Kans. , and Kansas_City , Mo..
   Meanwhile , there appears to be enough money in the road 's reserve_fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years.
     Investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals.
     Traffic and revenues on the Chicago_Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike.
   If nothing is done , the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962.
   West_Virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months , and , despite recent improvement in revenues , holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same.
     These , however , are exceptions.
   The typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement.
     It 's going_to take time for investors to learn how many_of the toll-road bonds will pay_out in full.
   Already , however , several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins.
   Many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up_to the break-even point.
     A top American official , after a look at Europe 's factories , thinks the U._S. is in a  very serious situation  competitively.
     Commerce_Secretary_Luther_Hodges , accompanied by a member of our staff , on May 10 toured plants of two of Italy 's biggest companies - Fiat , the auto producer , and Olivetti , maker of typewriters and calculating_machines.
     Our staff man cabled from Turin as_follows -      Follow Secretary_Hodges through the Fiat plant , and you learn this :      One , modern equipment - much of_it supplied under the Marshall_Plan - enables Fiat to turn_out 2100 cars a day.
   About half of these are exported.
      Two , wage costs are a fraction of the U._S. costs.
   A skilled_worker on the assembly_line , for_example , earns $ 37 a week.
      Three , labor troubles are infrequent.
   Fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more_than six years.
      Said Secretary_Hodges : ' It 's a tough combination for the U._S. to face '.
      Olivetti had a special interest for Hodges.
   Olivetti took_over Underwood , the U._S. typewriter maker , in late 1959.
   Within a year , without reducing wages , Underwood 's production_costs were cut one third , prices were slashed.
   The result has been that exports of Underwood products have doubled.
      The Olivetti plant near Turin has modern layout , modern machinery.
   The firm is design-conscious , sales-conscious , advertising-conscious.
      Hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go_to the U._S..
   The inflow of foreign capital would help the U._S. balance_of_payments.
      Hodges predicted : ' I think we will see more foreign firms coming to the U._S..
   There are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas  '.
     Foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that Washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports.
     The recently unveiled Kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for American businessmen in many lines.
     Important aspects of the Kennedy textile plans are these :     An international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly by President_Kennedy.
     Chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting.
     The U._S. will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years.
     Point is that developing countries often build_up a textile industry first , need encouragement to get on their feet.
   If they have trouble exporting , international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would.
     Idea is to let these countries earn their way as_much_as_possible.
     At_the_same_time , another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports - especially dumping of specific products - to high-wage textile-producing countries.
     Japan , since 1957 , has been  voluntarily  curbing exports of textiles to the U._S..
   Hong_Kong , India and Pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to Britain for several years under the  Lancashire_Pact .
     None of these countries is happy with these arrangements.
     The Japanese want to increase exports to the U._S. While they have been curbing shipments , they have watched Hong_Kong step_in and capture an expanding share of the big U._S. market.
     Hong_Kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to Britain , while Spanish and Portuguese textiles pour into British market unrestrictedly.
     The Indians and Pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the_British market for similar reasons.
     The Kennedy hope is that , at the conference or through bilateral talks , the low-wage textile-producing countries in Asia and Europe will see that  dumping  practices cause friction all_around and may result in import quotas.
     Gradual , controlled expansion of the world 's textile trade is what President_Kennedy wants.
   This may point_the_way toward international stabilization agreements in other products.
   It 's an important clue to Washington thinking.
     Note , too , that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U._S. textile industry.
      Get competitive or get_out .
   In veiled terms , that 's what the Kennedy_Administration is saying to the American textile industry.
   The Government will help in transferring companies and workers into new_lines , where modernization does n't seem feasible.
   Special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed.
   Government research will look_into new products and methods.
     Import quotas are n't ruled_out where the national interest is involved.
     But the Kennedy_Administration does n't favor import quotas.
   Rather , they are impressed with the_British Government 's success in forcing - and helping - the_British textile industry to shrink and to change_over to other products.
     What 's happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from low-wage countries.
     Among the highest-paid workers in the world are U._S. coal_miners.
   Yet U._S. coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers ' mouths water.
     Steel_Company of Wales , a British steelmaker , wants to bring_in Virginia coal , cut_down on its takings of Welsh coal in_order_to be able to compete more effectively - especially in foreign markets.
     Virginia coal , delivered by ship in Wales , will be about $ 2.80 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines.
     U._S. coal is cheap , despite high wages , because of widespread mechanization of mines , wide coal_seams , attactive rates on ocean freight.
   Many_of the coal_seams in the nationalized British mines are twisting , narrow and very deep.
     Productivity of U._S. miners is twice that of the_British.
     Welsh coal_miners , Communist-led , are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel_company bring_in American coal.
   They threaten to strike.
     The_British Government will have to decide whether to let U._S. coal in.
   The_British coal_industry is unprofitable , has large coal stocks it can n't sell.
    
    Every library borrower , or at_least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically ,  I 'm sorry , but we do n't have that book.
   There would n't be much demand for it , I 'm afraid .
     Behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest.
   What to buy out of the year 's grist of nearly 15000 book titles?
   What to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small?
   Most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate.
   A startlingly high percentage do not exceed $ 500 annually , which includes the librarian 's salary , and not even the New_York Public has enough money to meet its needs - this in the world 's richest city.
   The plight of a small community library is proportionately worse.
     Confronted with this situation , most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have , or_else depend_on the bounty of patrons and local_governments to supplement their annual funds.
   In some parts of the country , however , a co-operative movement has begun to grow , under the wing of state_governments , whereby , with the financial help of the state , libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis.
     New_York State has what is probably the_most advanced of these co-operative systems , so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow.
   Because it is so large a state , with marked contrasts in population density , the organization of the New_York co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works.
   At one extreme are the systems of upper New_York State , where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large , sparsely populated area.
   At the other are organizations like the newly formed Nassau_Library_System , in a high-density area , with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve.
     Both these types , and those in_between , are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at Albany as early as 1950 , with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state.
   It was a step in the right direction , but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today.
     Under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts.
   An earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not , as they saw fit.
   Some library boards are wary of the plan.
   A large , well-stocked library , surrounded in a county by smaller ones , may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great.
   A small library may cherish its independence and established ways , and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board.
     Within a system , however , the autonomy of each member library is preserved.
   The local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library_program , facilities , and services , but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system.
   All services are given without cost to members.
   So obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per_cent of the population of New_York State now has access to a system , and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day , not too distant , when all the libraries in the state will belong_to a co-op.
     To set_up a co-operative library system , the law requires a central book collection of 100000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus , and the system is organized around it.
   The collection may be in an existing library , or it may be built up in a central collection.
   Each system develops differently , according to the area it serves , but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency.
   The basic state grant is thirty cents for_each_person served , and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up_to fifty cents per_capita , if a library spends a certain number of dollars.
     In Nassau_County , for_example , the heavily settled Long_Island suburb of New_York_City , the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons , a figure that has doubled since 1950.
   This system , by virtue of its variety and size , offers an inclusive view of the plan in_operation.
     The Nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service , what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge , and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area.
   The need is for reference_works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries , adequate_to satisfy everyday needs , could afford.
   Nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its Hempstead headquarters , which will reach its goal of 100000 volumes by 1965.
     The major part of_this collection is in the central headquarters building , and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers.
   Basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection , but there is also specialization in science and technology , an indicated weakness in local libraries.
   On microfilm , headquarters also has a file of the New_York Times from its founding in 1851 to the present day , as_well as bound volumes of important periodicals.
   The entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans.
     Headquarters gets about 100 requests every_day.
   It is connected by teletype with the State_Library in Albany , which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide.
   The books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries.
     Each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area , which headquarters could then build upon.
   East_Meadow has philosophy , psychology , and religion ; Freeport houses social_science , pure science , and language ; history , biography , and education are centered in Hempstead ; Levittown has applied_science , business , and literature ; while Hewlett-Woodmere is the repository of art , music , and foreign languages.
   The reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant , and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service.
     This kind_of cooperation is not wholly new , of_course.
   Public libraries in Nassau_County have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century , but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis.
   Local libraries find , too , that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system , and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library.
   The system passes_on these savings to its members.
   Further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing.
     Books are not the only resource of the system.
   Schools and community groups turn_to the headquarters film library for documentary , art , and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs , and to organizations in member communities.
   The_most recent film catalogue , available at each library , lists 110 titles presently in the collection , any of_which may be borrowed without charge.
   This catalogue lists separately films suitable for children , young adults , or adults , although some classics cut_across age_groups , such_as  Nanook of the North  ,  The Emperor 's Nightingale  , and  The Red_Balloon .
   Workshops are conducted by the system 's audio-visual consultant for the staffs of member libraries , teaching them the effective use of film as a library service.
     The system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together ; consequently an experienced children 's librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned library activities , cooperating with the children 's librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences , workshops , and frequent visits.
   Headquarters has also set_up a central juvenile book-review and book-selection center , to provide better methods of purchasing and selection.
   Sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters , where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups.
   Story hours , pre-school programs , activities with community agencies , and lists of recommended reading are all_in the province of the children 's consultant.
     Headquarters of the Nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days , threatening to expand beyond its boundaries.
   In_addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children 's program , headquarters has a public_relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county ; it prepares cooperative displays ( posters , booklists , brochures , and other promotional_material ) for use in member libraries ; it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used ; and it publishes Sum and Substance , a monthly newsletter , which reports the system 's activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries.
   The system itself is governed by a board_of_trustees , geographically representing its membership.
     In Nassau , as in other systems , the long-range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear_on the schools , and on adult education in_general.
   Librarians , a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication , can begin to see results today.
   Library use is multiplying daily , and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned Americans , the teen-agers.
   To them especially the librarians , with the help of co-ops , hope they will never have to say ,  I 'm sorry , we do n't have that book .
     Today , more_than ever before , the survival of our free society depends_upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned.
   The great advances made in recent years in Communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the Western world.
   The need for lifetime reading is apparent.
   Education must_not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives , for it is only through knowledge that we , as a nation , can cope_with the dangers that threaten our society.
     The desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life.
   We cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read ; if we are not discriminating in our reading ; if we do not know how to use what we do read.
   We must_not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age , as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word.
     A fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries.
   Although progress has been made in America 's system of libraries it still falls_short_of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed America.
   The problem grows in intensity each_year as man 's knowledge , and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word , continue to expand.
   The inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition.
   There are , for_example , approximately 25000000 people in_this country with no public library service and about 50000000 with inadequate service.
   In college libraries , 57 per_cent of the total number of books are owned by 124 of 1509 institutions surveyed last year by the U._S._Office of Education.
   And over 66 per_cent of the elementary_schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at_all.
     In every aspect of service - to the public , to children in schools , to colleges and universities - the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services.
   Only public understanding and support can provide that service.
     This is one of the main reasons for National_Library_Week , April 16 - 22 , and for its theme :  For a richer , fuller life , read !
    
    The General_Assembly , which adjourns today , has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle from the day it convened.
   It was faced immediately with a showdown on the schools , an issue which was met squarely in conjunction with the governor with a decision not to risk abandoning public education.
     There followed the historic appropriations and budget fight , in_which the General_Assembly decided to tackle executive powers.
   The final_decision went to the executive but a way has been opened for strengthening budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information they need.
     Long-range planning of programs and ways to finance them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid crisis-to-crisis government.
   This session , for_instance , may have insured a financial crisis two years from now.
     In_all the turmoil , some good legislation was passed.
   Some other good bills were lost in the shuffle and await future action.
   Certainly all can applaud passage of an auto title law , the school bills , the increase in teacher pensions , the ban on drag racing , acceptance by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate as outside city_limits , repeal of the college age limit law and the road maintenance bond issue.
     No action has been taken , however , on such major problems as ending the fee system , penal reform , modification of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks sales.
   Only a token start was made in attacking the tax reappraisal question and its companion issue of attracting industry to the state.
     The legislature expended most_of its time on the schools and appropriations questions.
   Fortunately it spared us from the usual spate of silly resolutions which in_the_past have made Georgia look_like anything but  the empire_state_of_the_South .
     We congratulate the entire membership on its record of good legislation.
   In the interim between now and next year , we trust the House and Senate will put their minds to studying Georgia 's very real economic , fiscal and social problems and come_up with answers without all the political heroics.
     The League of Women Voters , 40 now and admitting it proudly , is inviting financial contributions in the windup of its fund drive.
   It 's a good use of money.
     These women whose organization grew out of the old suffrage movement are dedicated_to Thomas_Jefferson 's dictum that one must cherish the people 's spirit but  Keep alive their attention .
      If once they become inattentive_to the public affairs  , Jefferson said ,  you and I , and Congress and assemblies , judges and governors , shall all become wolves .
     Newspapermen and politicians especially are aware_of the penetrating attention and expert analysis the league gives to public affairs.
   The league workers search out the pros and cons of the_most complex issues and make them available to the public.
   The harder the choice , the more willing the league is to wade in.
   And the league takes a stand , with great regularity , on_the_side of_right.
     Cities and counties interested in industrial development would do_well in the months ahead to keep their eyes peeled toward the 13 northwest Georgia counties that are members of the Coosa_Valley_Area_Planning and Development_Commission.
     Coupling its own budget of $ 83750 with a $ 30000 state grant authorized by Gov._Vandiver , the group expects to sign a contract in March with Georgia_Tech..
   Then a full-time planning office will be established in Rome to work with a five-member Georgia_Tech research_staff for development of an area planning and industrial development program.
     The undertaking has abundant promise.
   It recognizes the fact that what helps one county helps its neighbors and that by banding_together in an area-wide effort better results can be accomplished than through the go-it-alone approach.
     The Rusk belief in balanced defense , replacing the Dulles theory of massive retaliation , removes a grave danger that has existed.
     The danger lay not in believing that our own A-bombs would deter Russia 's use of hers ; that theory was and is sound.
   The danger lay_in the American delusion that nuclear deterrence was enough.
     By limiting American strength too_much to nuclear strength , this country limited its ability to fight any kind_of war besides a nuclear war.
   This strategy heightened the possibility that we would have a nuclear war.
     It also weakened our diplomatic stance , because Russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear war except in the ultimate extremity.
     This left the Soviets plenty of leeway to start low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable impunity.
     By maintaining the nuclear deterrent , but gearing American military_forces to fight conventional wars too , Secretary_of_State Rusk junks bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and builds more muscle and greater safety into our military position.
     DeKalb 's budget for 1961 is a record one and carries with_it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance.
     It includes a raise in the county minimum_wage , creation of several new jobs at the executive level , financing of beefed-up industrial development efforts , and increased expenditures for essential services such_as health and welfare , fire protection , sanitation and road maintenance.
     That such expansion can be obtained without a raise in taxes is_due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal planning on the part of the board of commissioners , headed by Chairman_Charles_O._Emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust he was given was well placed , and other county officials.
     G._Mennen_Williams is learning the difficulties of diplomacy rapidly.
   Touring Africa , the new U._S. assistant secretary_of_state observed  Africa should be for the Africans  and the_British promptly denounced him.
   Then he arrived in Zanzibar and found Africans carrying signs saying  American imperialists , go_home .
   Chin_up , Soapy.
     Confidence in the state 's economic future is reflected in the Georgia Power_Company 's record construction budget for this year.
     The firm does a large amount of research and its forecasts have meaning.
   It is good to know that Georgia will continue to have sufficient electrical_power not_only to meet the demands of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of industrialization.
     Georgia 's mental_health program received a badly needed boost from the General_Assembly in the form of a $ 1750000 budget increase for the Milledgeville_State_Hospital.
     Actually it amounts to $ 1250000 above what the institution already is receiving , considering the additional half-million dollars Gov._Vandiver allocated last year from the state surplus.
     Either way it sounds like a sizable hunk of money and is.
   But exactly how far it will go toward improving conditions is another question because there is so_much that needs doing.
     The practice of charging employes for meals whether they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished.
   The work week of attendants who are on_duty 65 hours and more per week should be reduced.
     More attendants , nurses and doctors should be hired.
   Patients deserve more attention than they are getting.
     Even with the increase in funds for the next fiscal_year , Georgia will be spending only around $ 3.15 per day per patient.
   The national average is more_than $ 4 and that figure is considered by experts in the mental_health field to be too low.
   Kansas , regarded_as tops in the nation in its treatment of the mentally_ill , spends $ 9 per day per patient.
     Georgia has made some reforms , true.
   The intensive treatment program is working well.
   But in so many other areas we still are dragging.
     Considering what is being done compared to what needs to be done , it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning toward making the best possible use of the increase granted.
   The boost is helpful but inadequate.
     Assassination , even of a tyrant , is repulsive to men of good conscience.
   Rafael_Trujillo , the often-blood thirsty dictator of the Dominican_Republic for 31 years , perhaps deserved his fate in an even-handed appraisal of history.
   But whether the murder of El_Benefactor in Ciudad_Trujillo means freedom for the people of the Caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered.
     Trujillo knew a great_deal about assassination.
   The responsibility for scores of deaths , including the abduction and murder of Jesus_Maria_Galindez , a professor at Columbia_University in New_York , has been laid at his door.
   He had been involved in countless schemes to do_away_with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such_as President_Romulo_Betancourt of Venezuela.
   It was a sort_of poetic_justice that at_the_time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow the Venezuelan government , reportedly involving the use of Dominican arms by former Venezuelan Dictator_Marcos_Perez_Jimenez , has been uncovered and quashed.
     The recent history of the Dominican_Republic is an almost classical study of the way in_which even a professedly benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive.
   Unquestionably Trujillo did some good things for his country : he improved public facilities such_as roads and sanitation , attracted industry and investment and raised the standard_of_living notably.
   But the price was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition.
     El_Benefactor 's vanity grew with his personal wealth.
   The jails were filled to overflowing_with political_prisoners who had incurred his displeasure.
   He maintained amply financed lobbies in the United_States and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise , and his influence extended even to Congress.
     Until the last year or_so the profession of friendship with the United_States had been an article of faith with Trujillo , and altogether too often this profession was accepted here as evidence of his good character.
   Tardily the Government here came to understand how this country 's own reputation was tarnished by the association with repression.
   Last year , after Trujillo had been cited for numerous aggressions in the Caribbean , the United_States and many other members of the Organization_of_American_States broke diplomatic relations with him.
     Thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines.
   Trujillo 's dictatorship had been along conservative , right-wing lines.
   But after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing Communist slogans.
   There was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with Castro in Cuba , previously a bete_noire to Trujillo - thus illustrating the way in_which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces.
     What comes_after Trujillo is now the puzzle.
   The Dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little freedom for a generation , and all alternative leadership has been suppressed.
   Perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability , but the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger.
   The Dominican_Republic could turn toward Communist-type authoritarianism as easily as toward Western freedom.
   Such a twist would be a tragedy for the Dominican people , who deserve to breathe without_fear.
   For that reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative government to the Dominican_Republic will need the greatest sympathy and help.
     High-speed buses on the George_Washington Memorial_Parkway , operating between downtown Washington and Cabin_John , Glen_Echo and Brookmont , would constitute an alluring sample of_what the new National_Capital Transportation_Agency can do for this city.
   In presenting plans for such express_buses before the Montgomery_County_Council , the administrator of the NCTA , C._Darwin_Stolzenbach , was frankly seeking support for the projects his agency will soon be launching.
   Such support should not be difficult to come_by if all the plans to be presented by the NCTA are as attractive as this outline of express_buses coming into the downtown area.
     Because the buses would not stop on the parkway , land for bus_stations and for parking_areas nearby will be needed.
   The NCTA is well-advised to seek funds for this purpose from the present session of Congress.
    
    The inference has been too widely accepted that because the Communists have succeeded in building barricades across Berlin the free_world must acquiesce in dismemberment of_that living city.
     So_far as the record is concerned , the Western powers have not acquiesced and should not do so.
     Though Walter_Ulbricht , by grace of Soviet tanks , may be head man in East_Germany , that does not give him any right to usurp the government of East_Berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the Soviet zone.
     The wartime protocol of September 12 , 1944 , designated a special  Greater_Berlin  area , comprising the entire city , to be under joint occupation.
   It was not a part of any one of the three ( later four ) zones for occupation by Soviet , American , British , and French troops respectively.
   After the Berlin blockade and airlift , the Council of Foreign_Ministers in 1949 declared a purpose  to mitigate the effects of the present administrative_division of Germany and of Berlin .
     For_some_time the Communists honored the distinction between the Soviet zone of Germany and the Soviet sector of Berlin by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas.
   Then they moved offices of the East_German puppet government into East_Berlin and began illegally to treat it as the capital of East_Germany.
     That this and the closing of the East_Berlin-West_Berlin border have not been accepted by the Western governments appears in notes which Britain , France , and the United_States sent to Moscow after the latter 's gratuitous protest over a visit of Chancellor_Adenauer and other West German officials to West_Berlin.
   The Chancellor had as much business there as Ulbricht had in East_Berlin - and was certainly less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of Gerhard_Eisler.
     The_British and other replies to_that Moscow note pointed_out efforts of the Communist authorities  to integrate East_Berlin into East_Germany by isolating it from_the_outside and attempting to make it the capital of East_Germany .
   They insisted on the  fundamental fact  that  the whole of Berlin has a quadripartite status .
     This is far from acknowledging or recognizing those efforts as an accomplished_fact.
   There remains , of_course , the question of_what the West can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished_facts.
     One ground of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over into West_Berlin as Communist  vopos  try to gun_down fleeing unarmed residents.
   Another remained when an American_Army car was recovered but with a broken glass.
   The glass may seem trivial but Communist official hooliganism feeds_on such incidents unless they are redressed.
     Remembering the step-by-step fate of Danzig and the West German misgivings about  salami  tactics , it is to be hoped that the dispatch of General_Clay to West_Berlin as President_Kennedy 's representative will mark a stiffening of response not_only to future indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed.
     Thousands of buffalo (  bison  they will never be to the man on the street ) grazing like a mobile brown throw-rug upon the rolling , dusty-green grassland.
   A_horizon even and seamless , binding the vast sun-bleached dome of sky to earth.
     That picture of the American prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of those who have studied the conquest of the American continent as any later cinema image of the West made in live-oak canyons near Hollywood.
   For it was the millions of buffalo and prairie_chicken and the endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of Americans the abundant supply that was to take many_of them westward when the Ohio and Mississippi valleys began to fill.
     The National_Park Service now proposes to preserve an area in Pottawatomie_County , northeast Kansas , as a  Prairie National_Park .
   There the buffalo would roam , to be seen as a tapestry , not as moth-eaten zoo specimens.
   Wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved.
   Grasslands would extend , unfenced , unplowed , unbroken by silo or barn - as the first settlers saw them.
     The Park_Service makes an impressive ecological and statistical case for creating this new park.
   American history should clinch the case when Congress is asked to approve.
     A Philadelphia distiller is currently breaching the customary prohibition against hard-liquor advertising on TV and radio.
   Starting with small stations not members of the National_Association of Broadcasters , the firm apparently is seeking to break_down the anti-liquor barriers in major-market stations.
     Probably the best answer to this kind_of entering wedge is congressional action requiring the Federal Communications Commission to ban such advertising through its licensing power.
     The National_Association of Broadcasters code specifically bars hard-liquor commercials.
   Past polls of public_opinion show popular favor for this policy.
   Even the Distilled_Spirits_Institute has long had a specific prohibition.
     Why , then , with these voluntary barricades and some state laws barring liquor ads , is it necessary to seek congressional action?
   Simply because the subverting action of firms that are not members of the Distilled_Spirits_Institute and of radio and TV_stations that are not members of the NAB tends to spread.
     Soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly from the efforts of non-code competitors.
     Although the false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly no_more fatuous than the pseudo-sophistication with which TV soft-drinks are downed or toothpaste applied , there is a sad difference between enticing a viewer into sipping Oopsie-Cola and gulling him into downing bourbon.
     A law is needed.
     Registered Democrats in New_York_City this year have the opportunity to elect their party 's candidates for Mayor and other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization.
     In the central contest , that for Mayor , they may have found some pertinent points in_what each faction has said about the other.
     Mayor_Robert_F._Wagner must , as his opponents demand , assume responsibility for his performance in office.
   While all citizens share_in blame for lax municipal ethics the Wagner regime has seen serious problems in the schools , law_enforcement and fiscal policies.
   The Mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record.
     State_Controller_Arthur_Levitt , on_the_other_hand , cannot effectively deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than in the city 's welfare.
   They , too , have links with the city 's ills.
     Both men are known to be honest and public-spirited.
   Mayor_Wagner 's shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed than those of Mr._Levitt who left an impression of quiet competence in his more protected state post.
     As Mayor , Mr._Levitt might turn_out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters would like.
   His election , on_the_other_hand , would unquestionably strengthen the  regulars .
     Mr._Wagner might or might not be a  new  Mayor in_this third term , now that he is free_of the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls  bosses .
   These are , of_course , the same people whose support he has only now rejected to seek the independent vote.
     But his reelection would strengthen the liberal Democrats and the labor_unions who back him.
     If this choice is less exciting than New_York Democrats may wish , it nevertheless must be made.
   The vote still gives citizens a voice in the operation of their government and their party.
     Both Mr._K 's have so_far continued to speak softly and carry big sticks over Laos.
     President_Kennedy , already two quiet demands down , still refused Thursday to be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to Moscow.
   But at_the_same_time he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an hour of the fighting.
   And Secretary_Rusk , en_route to Bangkok , doubtless is trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of Australian or Thai_SEATO forces.
     For Mr._Kennedy , speaking softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation.
   The new President is in no position to start_out his dealings with Moscow by issuing callable bluffs.
   He must show at the outset that he means exactly what he says.
     In_this case he has put the alternatives clearly to Mr._Khrushchev for the third time.
   At his press_conference Mr._Kennedy said ,  All we want in Laos is peace not war.
   A truly neutral government not a cold_war pawn .
   At the scene he has just_as clearly shown his military strength in unprovocative but ready position.
     Since Laos is of no_more purely military value to Moscow itself than it is to Washington , this approach might be expected to head_off Mr._Khrushchev for_the_moment.
   But because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in Laos , the Soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride - a course that would appear to cost him little on_the_spot , but would bog Washington in a tactical mess.
     As wars go , Laos is an extremely little one.
   Casualties have been running about a dozen men a day.
   The hard core of the pro-Communist rebel force numbers only some 2000 tough Viet_Minh guerrilla fighters.
   But for the United_States and its SEATO allies to attempt to shore_up a less tough , less combat-tested government army in monsoon-shrouded , road-shy , guerrilla-th ' - wisp terrain is a risk not savored by Pentagon planners.
     But if anything can bring_home to Mr._Khrushchev the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment from watching this Braddock-against-the-Indians contest , it will probably be the fact that SEATO forces are ready to attempt it - plus the fact that Moscow has something to lose from closing_off disarmament and other bigger negotiations with Washington.
     Fortunately both the Republicans and America 's chief Western allies now are joined behind the neutral Laos aim of the President.
   Actually it would be more accurate to say that the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the_British policy of seeking to achieve a neutral Laos via the international bargaining table.
     It is ironic that Washington is having to struggle so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable.
   The State_Department tacitly rejected the neutral Laos idea after the Geneva conference of 1954 , and last year Washington backed the rightist coup that ousted neutral Premier_Souvanna_Phouma.
     But since last fall the United_States has been moving toward a pro-neutralist position and now is ready to back the_British plan for a cease-fire patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of interested powers.
     The road to a guaranteed-neutral , coup-proof Laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on_that nation 's terrain.
   But for the safety of Southeast_Asia , and for the sake of the Laotian people - who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority now engaged in the fighting - this last big effort to seal that country from the cold_war had to be made.
   The world awaits Mr._Khrushchev 's choice of alternatives.
     The Senate 's overwhelming ( 64 - 13 ) vote to support locally controlled educational TV efforts should be emulated in the lower house.
     Twice previously the Senate has approved measures backing ETV and the House has let f die.
   But f year prospects may be better.
   The House communications subcommittee is expected to report_out a good bill calling_for the states to match federal funds.
     This year 's Senate measure would provide each state and the District_of_Columbia with $ 1000000 to be used in support of private , state , or municipal ETV efforts.
   The funds would be used for equipment , not for land , buildings , or operation.
     The relatively few communities that have educational stations have found them of considerable value.
   But , lacking money from commercial sponsors , the stations have had difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service.
   Other communities - the ones to be aided most by the Senate bill - have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial cost of equipment.
    
    Sam_Rayburn was a good man , a good American , and , third , a good Democrat.
     He was all_of these rolled into one sturdy figure ; Mr._Speaker , Mr._Sam , and Mr._Democrat , at one_and_the_same time.
     The House was his habitat and there he flourished , first as a young representative , then as a forceful committee chairman , and finally in the post for which he seemed intended from birth , Speaker of the House , and second most powerful man in Washington.
     Mr._Rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to label.
   He was no flaming liberal , yet the New_Deal , the Fair_Deal and the New_Frontier needed him.
   He was not a rear-looking conservative , yet partisans of_that persuasion will miss him as much_as any.
     Two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence and that he keep his word.
   Sam_Rayburn took unnumbered secrets with him to the grave , for he was never loquacious , and his word , once given , was not subject_to retraction.
   It might be added that as he kept his word so he expected that others keep theirs.
     The demonstration of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical.
   His leadership was not for audiences.
   A growl , a nod , was usually enough.
   When it was not , one of the great dramas of Washington would be presented.
   He would rise in the well of the House , his chin upon his chest , his hands gripping the side of a desk , and the political and legislative chatter would subside into silence.
     He spoke briefly , sensibly , to_the_point and without oratorical flourishes He made good , plain American common_sense and the House usually recognized it and acted upon it.
     These public efforts were rare because Mr._Rayburn normally did his counseling , persuading and educating long before an issue reached its test on the House floor.
   He expected Democrats to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed_out to them.
   With his long service he had a long memory , an excellent thing in a political_leader.
     He was , of_course , in the House for a_very_long_time.
   There are only two men remaining in Congress who , with Rayburn , voted for the declaration of war against Germany in 1917.
   To almost two generations of Americans it must have seemed as though the existence of Mr._Sam coincided with_that of the House.
     And it was the House he loved.
   To be presiding_officer of_it was the end of his desire and ambition.
   The Senate to him was not the  upper body  and he corrected those who said he served  under  the president.
   He served  with  him.
     Sound the roll of those with whom he served and who preceded him in death.
   Woodrow_Wilson , with whom he began his years in Washington , Warren_G._Harding , Calvin_Coolidge , FDR , with whom he managed a social revolution.
   And those still with us , Herbert_C._Hoover , Harry_S._Truman , Dwight_D._Eisenhower and John_F._Kennedy.
     He was a fighter for those of his own party.
   Mr._Truman has only to recall the  hopeless  campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the first experience of Mr._Kennedy with Congress would have been sadder than it was had not Mr._Sam been there.
   As it was , his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration.
     With Republican presidents , he fought fair.
   He was his own man , not an automatic obstructionist.
   He kept his attacks on Republicanism for partisan campaigns , but that is part of the game he was_born to play.
     Under any name - Mr._Speaker , Mr._Democrat , Mr._Sam - he was a good man.
     Thirteen Italian airmen who went_to the Congo to serve the cause of peace under the United_Nations banner have instead met violent_death at the hands of Congolese troops supposedly their friends.
     In 18 months , no_more grisly incident has been reported from_that jungle.
   Simply out of bloodlust , their murderers dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into the river.
   The excuse was offered for them that they had mistaken the Italians for Belgian mercenaries.
   In_other_words , atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central government might be condoned , had the victims been serving the cause of dissident Katanga.
     Does this suggest that the Congo is fit for nationhood or that UN is making any progress whatever toward its goal of so making_it?
   To_the_contrary , through the past six weeks violence has been piled upon violence.
   Mass rapes , troop mutinies , uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures , given no sanction by any political authority , have become almost daily occurrences.
   Yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is not the work of Katanga.
   It happens in the territory of the Leopoldville government , which is itself a fiction , demonstrably incapable_of governing , and commanding only such limited credit abroad as UN support gives it.
     The main question raised by the incident is how much longer will UN bury its head in the sand on the Congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in present terms?
   The probable answer is that it will do so just_as long as Russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young African_nations wake_up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on Central_Africa.
     Right_now , they are pushing a resolution which would have UN use its forces to invade and subjugate Katanga.
   That notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several points_of_view.
   The UN army is too weak , too demoralized for the task.
   Further , it has its work cut_out stopping anarchy where it is now garrisoned.
   Last , it makes no sense to deliver Katanga , the one reasonably solid territory , into the existing chaos.
     The Congo should have been mandated , because it was not_ready for independence.
   The idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed over wisdom.
   It is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism.
   But if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the General_Assembly , it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach.
   Otherwise , UN will march blindly on to certain defeat.
     A recent editorial discussing a labor-management agreement reached between the Southern_Pacific_Co. and the Order of Railroad Telegraphers has been criticized on the grounds that it was not based on complete information.
     The editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed 40 hours ' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction in their number was limited to 2 per_cent per_year.
   Our comment was that this was  featherbedding  in its ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such an agreement.
   The statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers , but that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life.
     Additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of_which it was in need.
   Also , normal personal attrition would make the job reduction provision more_or_less academic.
     The situation with regard_to the Southern_Pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries.
   The solution reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally included in_a_series of union demands.
     Time was when the house of delegates of the American_Bar association leaned to the common_sense side.
   But the internationalists have taken_over the governing body of the bar , and when the lads met in St._Louis , it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the United_Nations was scarcely less_than wonderful , despite an imperfection here_and_there.
     It was , the brief writers decided ,  man 's best hope for a peaceful and law abiding world .
   Peace , it 's wonderful , and  world law  , it 's wonderful , too , and should n't we get an international covenant extending it into space , before the Russians put some claim jumper on the moon?
     Meanwhile , in Moscow , Khrushchev was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build a bomb with a wallop equal_to 100 million tons of TNT , to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can n't see the justice of surrendering West_Berlin to communism.
     A nuclear pacifier of these dimensions - roughly some six and a half_times bigger than anything the United_States has triggered experimentally - would certainly produce a bigger bang , and , just for kicks , Khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from St._Louis to the moon , where there would n't even be any beer to drink.
     While he was at it , the philosopher of the Kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who can n't appreciate coexistence thru suicide.
      Fools  , he bayed ,  what do you think you are doing ?
     The only response we can think_of is the humble one that at_least we are n't playing the marimba with our shoes in the United_Nations , but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort.
     Another evidence of the spreading rule of reason was provided from Mexico_City with the daily hijacking of an American_plane by a demented Algerian with a gun.
   The craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to Havana , where , for some unknown reason , Castro rushed to the airport to express mortification to the Colombian foreign_minister , a passenger , who is not an admirer of old Ten O ' Clock_Shadow.
   The plane was sent back to the United_States , for a change , but Castro kept the crazy gunman , who will prove a suitable recruit to the revolution.
     Less respect for the legal conventions was displayed by Castro 's right_hand man , Che_Guevara , who edified the Inter-American Economic_and_Social_council meeting in Montevideo by reading two secret American documents purloined from the United_States embassy at Caracas , Venezuela.
   The contents were highly embarrassing to American spokesmen , who were on_hand to promise Latin_Americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium.
     Perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing American diplomatic papers and planes , but the Kennedy administration can always file a demurrer to the effect that , but for its own incompetence in protecting American interests , these things would not happen.
   The same can be said about the half-hearted Cuban invasion mounted by the administration last April , which , we trust , is not symptomatic_of the methods to be invoked in holding_off the felonious Khrushchev.
     Pass the iron rations , please , and light another candle , for it 's getting dark down here and we 're minded to read a_bit of world law just to pass the time away.
     The board of suspension of the Interstate_Commerce commission has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight_rates on grain , as they had planned to do this month.
     The request for lower rates originated with the Southern railway , which has spent a good_deal of time and money developing a 100 - ton hopper car with which it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional , smaller car.
   By reducing rates as much_as 60 per_cent , it and its associated railroads hope to win_back some of the business they have lost to truckers and barge lines.
     The board 's action shows what free_enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws.
    
    Word OF Dag_Hammarskjold 's death in an African plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe.
   As head of the United_Nations he was the symbol of world peace , and his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously.
   It was on the eve of a momentous U._N. session to come_to_grips with cold_war issues.
   His firm hand will be desperately missed.
     Mr._Hammarskjold was in Africa on a mission of peace.
   He had sought talks with Moise_Tshombe , the secessionist president of Congo 's Katanga province where recent fighting had been bloody.
   He earnestly urged a cease-fire.
     The story of the fatal crash is not fully known.
   The U._N. - chartered plane which was flying from the conference city of Ndola in Northern_Rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun bullets last weekend and was newly repaired.
   Whether this , or overt action , was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined.
     The death of Mr._Hammarskjold removes the United_Nations ' most controversial leader.
   He was controversial because he was uncompromising for peace and freedom with justice.
   He courageously defended the rights of small nations , and he stood his ground against the savage attacks of the Communist bloc.
     The Congo , in whose cause he died , was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs.
   His policies had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold_war and workable solutions were beginning to take_shape.
   When the recent Katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions Mr._Hammarskjold , despite the danger , flew to exert a calming influence.
   He gave his life for his beliefs.
     The U._N. session scheduled for today will meet under the cloud of his passing.
   It is a crucial session with the world on the edge of momentous developments.
     If the manner of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with_reason and justice.
   That is the hope of mankind.
     Reaching agreement on projects of value to the whole community has long been one of Greater_Miami 's hardest tasks.
   Too many have bogged_down in bickering.
   Even when public bodies arrived at a consensus , at_least one dissenting vote has been usual.
     So we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity.
   All nine members of the Inter-American_Center_Authority voted for Goodbody + Company 's proposal to finance the long-awaited trade and cultural center.
     The widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell_out the terms of its contract.
   If the indenture is accepted , the authority will proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue.
   Then Goodbody will hand_over a minimum of $ 15.5 million for developing the spacious Graves_Tract to house the center.
     The next step awaits approval today by the Metro commissioners as the members of the Dade_County_Port_Authority.
   They allotted $ 500000 three years ago to support Interama until its own financing could be arranged.
   Less_than half the sum has been spent , since the Interama board pinched_pennies during that period of painstaking negotiations.
   The balance is being budgeted for the coming year.
     Unanimity on Interama is not surprising.
   It is one of the rare public ventures here on_which nearly everyone is agreed.
   The City of Miami recently yielded a prior claim of $ 8.5 million on the Graves_Tract to clear the way for the project.
   County officials have cooperated consistently.
   So have the people 's elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels.
     Interama , as it rises , will be a living monument to Greater_Miami 's ability to get together on worthwhile enterprises.
     Progress , or lack of_it , toward civil_rights in the 50 states is reported in an impressive 689 - page compilation issued last week by the United_States Commission on Civil_Rights.
     Much happened in_this field during the past 12 months.
   Each state advisory committee documented its own activity.
   Some accounts are quite lengthy but Florida 's is the shortest of all , requiring only four paragraphs.
      The established pattern of relative calm in the field of race relations has continued in_all areas  , reported this group headed by Harold_Colee of Jacksonville and including two South_Floridians , William_D._Singer and John_B._Turner of Miami.
      No complaints or charges have been filed during the past year , either verbally or written , from any individual or group.
      The committee continues to feel that Florida has progressed in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from_time_to_time in the entire spectrum of civil_rights .
     Problems have arisen in_this sensitive field but have been handled in most cases with_understanding and restraint.
   The progress reported by the advisory committee is real.
   While some think we move too fast and_others too slowly , Florida 's record is a good one and stands_out among the 50.
     West_Germany will face the crucial tests that lie ahead , on Berlin and unification , with a coalition government.
   This is the key fact emerging from Sunday 's national election.
     Chancellor_Adenauer 's Christian Democratic_Party slipped only a_little in the voting but it was enough to lose the absolute Bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957.
   In_order_to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival parties which gained strength.
   Inevitably this means some compromise.
     The aging chancellor in_all likelihood will be retired.
   Both Willy_Brandt 's Social Democrats , who gained 22 seats in the new parliament , and the Free Democrats , who picked_up 23 , will insist on_that before they enter the government.
     Moon-faced Ludwig_Erhart , the economic_expert , probably will ascend to the leadership long denied him.
     If he becomes chancellor , Dr._Erhart would make few changes.
   The wizard who fashioned West_Germany 's astonishing industrial rebirth is the soul of free_enterprise.
   He is dedicated_to building the nation 's strength and , as are all West Germans , to a free Berlin and to reunion with captive East_Germany.
     What is in doubt as the free Germans and their allies consider the voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result.
     If the party of Adenauer and Erhart , with 45 per_cent of the vote , approaches the party of Willy_Brandt , which won 36 per_cent , the result would be a stiffening of the old resolve.
   West_Berlin 's Mayor_Brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his city and won votes by it.
     The Free Democrats ( 12 per_cent of the vote ) believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with the Soviet_Union , and more dealings with the Communist bloc.
     The question left by the election is whether West_Germany veers slightly toward more firmness or more flexibility.
   It could go either way , since the gains for both points_of_view were about the same.
     Regardless_of the decision two facts are clear.
   West_Germany , with its industrial and military might , reaffirmed its democracy and remains_firm with the free nations.
   And the career of Konrad_Adenauer , who upheld Germany 's tradition of rock-like leaders which Bismarck began , draws_near the end.
     Americans are a nation of joiners , a quality which our friends find endearing and sometimes amusing.
   But it can be dangerous if the joiner does n't want to make a spectacle of himself.
     For_instance , so-called  conservative  organizations , some of them secret , are sprouting in the garden of joining where  liberal  organizations once took_root.
     One specific example is a secret  fraternity  which will  coordinate anti-Communist efforts .
   The principle is commendable but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going_to get gulled.
     According to The Chicago_Tribune_News_Service , State_Atty._Gen._Stanley_Mosk of California has devised a series of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization seeking his money and his name :     Does it assail schools and churches with blanket accusations?
     Does it attack other traditional American institutions with unsupportable and wild charges?
     Does it put the label of un-American or subversive on everyone with whom it disagrees politically?
     Does it attempt to rewrite modern history by blaming American statesmen for wars , communism , depression , and other troubles of the world?
     Does it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone_calls and letter writing campaigns?
     Do its spokesmen seem more interested in the amount_of_money they collect than in the principles they purport to advocate?
     In some instances a seventh question can be added :     Does the organization show an affinity for a foreign government , political_party or personality in_opposition or preference to the American system?
     If the would-be joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic apprehensions of Americans in a troubled time.
   Falling somewhere in a category between Einstein 's theory and sand_fleas - difficult to see but undeniably there , nevertheless - is the tropical green  city  of Islandia , a string of offshore islands that has almost_no residents , limited access and an unlimited future.
   The latter is what concerns us all.
   Whatever land you can see here , from the North tip end of Elliott_Key looking southward , belongs to someone - people who have title to the land.
   And what you can n't see , the land underneath the water , belongs to someone , too.
   The public.
   The only real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment.
   In the fairly brief but hectic history of Florida , the developers of waterfront land have too often wound_up with both their land and ours.
   In_this instance , happily , insistence is being made that our share is protected.
   And until this protection is at_least as concrete as , say , the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at Miami_Beach , those who represent us all should agree to nothing.
     The reaction of certain City_Council members to California 's newest anti-secrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing.
     We had assumed that at_least this local legislative body had nothing to hide , and , therefore , had no objections to making the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available to the public.
     In the preamble to the open-meeting statutes , collectively known as the Brown_Act , the Legislature declares that  the public commissions , boards and councils and other public agencies in_this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people 's business.
   It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly.
      The people of_this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them.
   The people , in delegating authority , do not give their public_servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know.
     The full implementation of these noble words , however , has taken the efforts of five sessions of the Legislature.
   Since 1953 California has led the nation in enacting guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted , but not until this year did the lawmakers in Sacramento plug the remaining loopholes in the Brown_Act.
     Despite the lip_service paid by local_governments , the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted by reservations and rationalizations.
   When all else fails , it is argued that open sessions slow_down governmental operations.
     We submit that this is a most_desirable effect of the law - and one of its principal aims.
   Without public scrutiny the deliberations of public agencies would no_doubt be conducted more speedily.
   But the citizens would , of_course , never be sure that the decisions that resulted were as correct as they were expeditious.
    
    If THE Dominican_Republic achieves free , democratic government , it will be_due in large part to the U._S. show of force that enabled President_Balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of Trujillo dictatorship.
     Outwardly , Ciudad_Trujillo is calm.
   None of the Trujillo family remains.
   Mr._Balaguer is in control , and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring.
     Had U._S. warships not appeared off the Dominican coast , there is every possibility that the country would now be wracked by civil_war.
   Ultimately either the Trujillos would have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions favorable to a takeover by Dominican elements responsive to Castro in Cuba.
     Within the Organization_of_American_States , there may be some criticism of_this unilateral American intervention which was not without risk obviously.
   But there was no complaint from the Dominican crowds which lined Ciudad_Trujillo 's waterfront shouting ,  Vive Yankees !
   More , the U._S. action was hailed by a principal opposition leader , Dr._Juan_Bosch , as having saved  many lives and many troubles in the near future .
     Mr._Balaguer 's troubles are by_no_means over.
   He will need the help of all OAS members to eradicate , finally , the forces of authoritarianism , pro-Trujillo and pro-Castro alike.
   In cooperating toward that objective , OAS might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated by the United_States.
     Those watching the growing rivalry between craft_unions and industrial_unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor split in 1935.
     Now , as then , it is a matter of jobs.
   Craft_unions seek work that industrial_unions claim , such_as factory maintenance.
     The issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession from the American_Federation of Labor of its industrial_union members.
   That breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the American_Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial_Organizations.
   Or that 's what it looked_like at_the_time.
     But automation and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition for jobs.
   Walter_Reuther , leader of the industrial_union faction of the AFL - CIO , says another two years of_this squabbling will be disastrous for all American labor.
     Whether it could be as disastrous for American labor as , say , Jimmy_Hoffa of the Teamsters , is a matter of conjecture.
   But the jurisdictional disputes that result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win friends for labor.
     Engaged as_it_is in a battle for world trade as a condition of national survival , this country can have little patience with labor 's family feuds.
   The concept of labor as a special class is outmoded , and in the task confronting America as bastion of the free_world , labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself to survive.
     The Army , Navy and Air_Force , among others , may question Secretary_Freeman 's claim that the high estate of United_States agriculture is the  strongest deterrent  to the spread of communism.
   But the secretary insists that the success of the American farmer is the  greatest single source of strength  in the struggle to insure freedom around the world.
     Mr._Freeman said that in many_of the countries he visited on a recent world trade trip people were more awed by America 's capacity to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production - or even by the Soviet 's successes in space.
   This should n't surprise the secretary ; American taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses for a long , long_time.
     In_fact , over the years , the American farmer 's capacity to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large dollar.
   And thus_far , Mr._Freeman has offered very little relief.
     The 1961 feed_grain program , which the secretary sponsored , has been declared a_billion dollar fiasco.
   In exchange for higher price_supports , growers pledged reduction in planted acreage.
   But the farmers outsmarted Washington by shortening the distance between the rows and pouring on the fertilizer.
     The result : $ 1.1 billion added to the deficit in the federal budget.
   Perhaps , as Mr._Freeman says , American agriculture may stop the Communists , but it is also swindling the American taxpayer.
     A Senate subcommittee headed by Sen._Jackson of Washington has been going_over the State_Department and has reached some predictable conclusions.
   The department needs a clearer  sense_of_direction  at the top and it needs fewer , but better , people , Sen._Jackson says.
     The subcommittee is not alone in questioning the effectiveness of the department.
   President_Kennedy has indicated his dissatisfaction with its performance.
     But those who would revitalize so complex an organization must , first_of_all , overcome the resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures , suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes.
     Nor does Sen._Jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in the White_House of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the study of foreign_policy.
   This tends to create friction and confusion and has not made it easier for Secretary_Rusk to restore vigor and initiative among his subordinates.
     But competent observers believe he is making progress , particularly toward what Sen._Jackson lists as the primary need -  a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them .
     The Jackson report will provide some of the political support Mr._Rusk will need if he is to get_rid_of department personnel engaged , as Sen._Jackson puts it ,  in work that does not really need doing .
   Mr._Rusk should also draw comfort from Sen._Jackson 's recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national security problems be improved.
   Self-criticism is a rare but needed commodity in Congress.
     Forecasting economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist.
   But now apparently the job of Secretary of Labor requires that he be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment trends.
     James_P._Mitchell , when he was the head of the department , promised to eat his hat if unemployment did n't drop below three million a_couple_of years ago.
   He lost , but settled for a cake in the shape of a fedora.
     His successor , Secretary_Goldberg , also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which has been holding just under 7 per_cent for the last 11 months.
   No betting man , Mr._Goldberg says he 's merely  putting my neck out again  by predicting the rate will go_down this month.
   He is basing his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened its stride - a new record high in personal_income , an increase in housing starts , a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for durable_goods.
     Mr._Mitchell had an excuse for losing - the steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated.
   Mr._Goldberg has less reason for missing.
   The economy seems to be sailing along on an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an end so they can n't be blamed in November.
   The odds thus appear favorable that the secretary 's neck may be spared.
     Cambodia 's chief_of_state , who has been accused of harboring Communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for neighboring South Viet_Nam and Thailand , insists he would be very unhappy if communism established its power in Southeast_Asia.
     But so convinced of communism 's inevitable triumph is Prince_Sihanouk that he is ready to throw_in_the_towel.
    I have to see the facts  , is the way the prince puts it.
   And from_that point of vantage he concedes another two years_of_grace to nations maintaining a pro-Western posture.
     Prince_Sihanouk 's powers of prognostication some_day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the courage of his convictions.
     Commerce_Secretary_Hodges seems to have been cast in the role of pacemaker for official Washington 's economic forecasters.
   Weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second quarter of_this year while his colleagues in the Cabinet were shaking their heads in_disagreement.
   Recently Treasury_Secretary_Dillon and Labor_Secretary_Goldberg fell into line with Mr._Hodges ' appraisal , though there has been some reluctance to do so at the White_House.
     And now Mr._Hodges has pioneered further into the economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped sliding and that it should start going upward from this point.
   He is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump.
     The secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail sales.
   February 's volume was 1 per_cent above January 's for the first pickup since last October , although it is still 1.5 per_cent off from February 1960.
     Corroborating Mr._Hodges ' figures was the Federal_Reserve_Board 's report of the large sales increase in the nation 's department_stores for the week ending March 4.
   In Newark , for_example , this gain was put at 26 per_cent above the year-earlier level.
   Of_course , some of the credit for the sale boost must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that Easter comes more_than two_weeks earlier than in 1960.
     Another optimistic sign , this one from the Labor_Department , was the report that the long rise in unemployment_compensation payments  was interrupted for_the_first_time in the week ending Feb. 25 .
   Initial claims for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8100 in the week ending March 4.
     Mr._Hodges is so hopeful over the outlook that he does n't think there will be any need of a cut in income_taxes.
   Well , we can n't have everything.
   Prosperity for the whole nation is certainly preferred to a tax cut.
     New_Jersey folk need not be told of the builder 's march to the sea , for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles of our shoreline and presses_on to develop the few open spaces that remain.
   Now the Stone_Harbor bird_sanctuary , 31 acres of magic attraction for exotic herons , is threatened , but the battlefront extends far beyond our state.
     Against the dramatic fight being waged for preservation of 30 miles of Cape_Cod shoreline , the tiny tract at Stone_Harbor may seem unimportant.
   But Interior_Secretary_Udall warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment of all as public preserves.
     The move for establishment of a national seashore park on 30000 acres of Cape_Cod , from Provincetown to Chatham , is strengthened by President_Kennedy 's interest in_that area.
   But preservation of the natural beauty of the Cape is of more_than regional concern , for the automobile age has made it the recreation spot of people from all_over the country.
     By comparison , Stone_Harbor bird_sanctuary 's allies seem less formidable , for aside from the Audubon_Society , they are mostly the snowy , common and cattle_egrets and the Louisiana , green , little blue and black-crowned herons who nest and feed there.
   But there is hope , for Conservation_Commissioner_Bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the kind_of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its park space.
     The desirability of preserving such places as the Cape dunes and Stone_Harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every_year.
   Public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is growing.
   But that heritage is shrinking even faster.
     Much of the glamor President_Kennedy 's Peace_Corps may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by Sargent_Shriver , the head corpsman.
   Anybody who is expecting a joyride should , according to Mr._Shriver , get_off the train right_now.
     First_of_all , the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling.
   It will be a 16 - hour training day.
   Then off to a remote place in an underdeveloped country where the diet , culture , language and living conditions will be different.
   And the pay , of_course , will be nil.
     Despite all this , the idea apparently has captured the imagination of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by the response than anybody else.
    
    The study of the St._Louis area 's economic prospects prepared for the Construction_Industry Joint_Conference confirms and reinforces both the findings of the Metropolitan St._Louis Survey of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the Missouri-Illinois countryside.
     St._Louis sits in_the_center of a relatively slow-growing and in some places stagnant mid-continent region.
   Slackened regional demand for St._Louis goods and services reflects the region 's relative lack of purchasing power.
   Not all St._Louis industries , of_course , have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood.
   But for those which do , the slow growth of the area has a retarding effect on the metropolitan core.
   The city has a stake in stimulating growth and purchasing power throughout outstate Missouri and Southern_Illinois.
     Gov._Dalton 's new Commerce and Industry Commission is moving to create a nine-state regional group in a collective effort to attract new industry.
   That is one approach.
   Another would be to take the advice of Dr._Elmer_Ellis , president of the University of Missouri , and provide_for an impartial professional analysis of Missouri 's economy.
   He says the state , in_order_to proceed with economic development , must develop an understanding of how the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the national economy.
     The research_center of the University 's School of Business and Public_Administration is prepared to undertake the analysis Dr._Ellis has been talking_about.
   He and Dean_John_W._Schwada of the Business_School outlined the project at a recent conference.
   The University can make a valuable contribution to the state 's economic development through such a study.
     In Southern_Illinois , the new federal program of help to economically depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth.
   The Carbondale_Industrial_Development_Corp. has obtained a $ 500000 loan to help defray the cost of remodeling a city-owned factory to accommodate production that will provide 500 new jobs.
   Carbondale is in the Herrin-Murphysboro-West_Frankfort labor_market , where unemployment has been substantially higher than the national average.
   The Federal program eventually should have a favorable impact on Missouri 's depressed areas , and in_the_long_run that will benefit St._Louis as_well.
     Politics-ridden St._Clair county in Illinois presents another piece of the problem of metropolitan development.
   More industrial acreage lies vacant in St._Clair county than in any other jurisdiction in the St._Louis area.
   The unstable political situation there represents one reason new plants shy_away_from the East_Side.
     And_then there is St._Louis county , where the Democratic leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound zoning , of the important relationship between proper land use and economic growth.
   St._Louis county under its present leadership also has largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform , and permitted parochial interests to take priority over area-wide interests.
   Some plant-location specialists take these signs to mean St._Louis county does n't want industry , and so they avoid the area , and more jobs are lost.
     Metropolitan St._Louis 's relatively slow rate_of_growth ought to be a priority concern of the political , business , civic and other leaders on both sides of the Mississippi.
   Without a great acceleration in the metropolitan area 's economy , there will not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters , and St._Louis will slip into second-class status.
     Many_of our very best friends are reformers.
   Still we must confess that sometimes some of them go too far.
   Take , for_example , the reformers among New_York_City 's Democrats.
   Having whipped Mr._De_Sapio in the primaries and thus come_into control of Tammany_Hall , they have changed the name to Chatham_Hall.
   Even_though headquarters actually have been moved_into the Chatham building , do they believe that they can make the new name stick?
     Granted that the Tammany name and the Tammany tiger often were regarded_as badges of political shame , the sachems of the Hall also have a_few good marks to their credit.
   But it is tradition rather_than the record which balks at the expunging of the Tammany name.
   After_all , it goes_back to the days in_which sedition was not un-American , the days in_which the Sons of St._Tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force and violence - the_British government that_is.
     Further , do our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo?
   They will - when they give_up the donkey and the elephant.
   Instead of attempting the impossible , why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger 's stripes are not black?
   That might go_over.
     The White_House itself has taken steps to remove a former Batista official , Col._Mariano_Faget , from his preposterous position as interrogator of Cuban refugees for the Immigration_Service.
     The Faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds.
   The Kennedy_Administration had assured anti-Castro Cubans that it would have nothing to do with associates of Dictator_Batista.
   Using a Batista man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic forces which alone can effectively oppose Castro.
     Moreover , Col._Faget 's information on Cuba was too outdated to be useful in  screening  Castro agents ; the Colonel fled to the friendly haven of the Dominican dictatorship as soon as Castro seized power.
   And while he had headed Batista 's anti-Communist section , the Batista regime did not disturb the Communists so_much as more open opponents who were alleged to be Communists.
     Responsibility for the Faget appointment rests with Gen._J._M. swing , an Eisenhower appointee as head of the Immigration_Service.
   Gen._Swing has received public attention before_this for abuse of some of the prerogatives of his office.
   His official term expired last summer.
   Some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend , Congressman_Walter of Pennsylvania , at a moment when the Kennedy_Administration was diligently searching for all the House votes it could get.
     Congressman_Walter has been all-powerful in immigration matters , but he has announced plans to retire in 1962.
   At that point the Administration will have little reason to hang_on to Gen._Swing.
   The Faget case was the kind_of salvage job the Administration should not have to repeat.
     As President , Dwight_D._Eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from the strife of partisan politics.
   As a former President , however , Mr._Eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during a New_York Republican rally , and generally missed his target.
     Mr._Eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost by a Peace_Corps girl in Nigeria to attack the entire Corps as a  juvenile experiment  and to suggest sending a Corps member to the moon.
   This was juvenile ridicule.
   Nowhere did the speaker recognize the serious purpose of the Corps or its welcome reception abroad.
   His words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name to the Eisenhower_Exchange Fellowships dedicated_to the same goal of international understanding.
     The former President blithely ignored recent history in speaking of  dollarette  dollars under Kennedy_Administration fiscal policies.
   It was the Eisenhower_Administration which produced the largest peacetime deficit.
     Finally , Mr._Eisenhower found nothing but confusion in Washington.
   This statement recalls the 1959 Berlin crisis , when President_Eisenhower first told reporters that Berlin could not be defended with conventional weapons and_then added that a nuclear defense was out of the picture too.
   The crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion has hardly been compounded.
     Ex-Presidents , relieved of accountability for policy , sometimes seem to feel free_of accountability for their words.
   Some of former President_Truman 's off-the-cuff discourses have been in_that vein.
   Nobody can deny the right of former Chief_Executives to take_part in politics , but the American people expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership and to treat issues with a sense_of_responsibility.
   This is a matter of respect for the Presidency.
   Mr._Eisenhower 's New_York speech does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship.
     The Queen_Mary has long been a symbol of speed , luxury , and impeccable British service on the high seas.
   Reports that the venerable liner , which has been in_service since 1936 , was to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many_of us.
   But the Cunard line , influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment , has decided to keep the Queen_Mary in_service until next Spring at_least.
     A new queen , with the prosaic title of Q3 , had been planned for several years to replace the Queen_Mary.
   The_British government , concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding_industry , had put_through a bill to give Cunard loans and grants totaling $ 50400000 toward the $ 84000000 cost of a new 75000 - ton passenger liner.
     Since 1957 , more_and_more trans-Atlantic passengers have been crossing by air.
   Economy class fares and charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines.
   Competition from other steamship_lines has cut Cunard 's share of sea passengers from one-third to one-fourth and this year the line showed a marked drop of profits on the Atlantic run.
     The Cunard line has under_consideration replacing the Queen_Mary with a ship smaller than 75000 tons.
   This would be cheaper to operate and could be used for cruises during the lean winter months.
   Also under_consideration is an increased investment in Cunard_Eagle Airways which has applied to serve New_York.
     The decline of the Cunard line from its position of dominance in Atlantic travel is a significant development in the history of transportation.
     Gen._Maxwell_Taylor 's statement in Saigon that he is  very_much encouraged  about the chances of the pro-Western government of Viet_Nam turning_back Communist guerrilla attacks comes_close to an announcement that he will not recommend dispatching United_States troops to bolster the Vietnamese Army.
   Gen._Taylor will report to President_Kennedy in a_few days on the results of his visit to South Viet_Nam and , judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the Far_East , he is likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of Vietnamese military , economic , political and other resources.
     There was good reason for Gen._Taylor to make an inspection trip at this time.
   Communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their activities and the great flood of the Mekong_River has interposed a new crisis.
   South Viet_Nam 's rice surplus for next year - more_than 300000 tons - may have been destroyed.
   The Viet_Cong , the Communist rebels , may have lost their stored grain and arms factories.
   The rebels may try to seize what is left of the October harvest when the floods recede and the monsoon ends in November.
     Nothing that is likely to happen , however , should prompt the sending of United_States soldiers for other_than instructional missions.
   The Indochina struggle was a war to stay out of in 1954 , when Gen._Ridgway estimated it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions at the outset to win a war the_French were losing.
   It is a war to stay out of today , especially in_view of the fact that President_Ngo_Dinh_Diem apparently does not want United_States troops.
   He may want additional technical help , and this should be forthcoming.
   South Viet_Nam has received $ 1450000000 in United_States aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance has been stepped_up since Vice_President Lyndon_B._Johnson 's visit last May.
     Gen._Taylor , the President 's special military adviser , is a level-headed officer who is not likely to succumb to propaganda or pressure.
   It is probable that his recommendations will be informed and workable , and that they will not lead to involving the United_States in an Asian morass.
     Gov._John_M._Dalton , himself a lawyer and a man of long service in government , spoke with rich background and experience when he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the Missouri General_Assembly , or quit accepting fees from individuals and corporations who have controversies with or axes_to_grind with the government and who are retained , not because of their legal talents , but because of their government influence.
    
    Ambassador_Stevenson yesterday described the U. N.
 's problem of electing a temporary successor to the late Dag_Hammarskjold as  the gravest crisis the institution has faced .
   Of_course it is.
   If the decision goes_wrong , it may be - as Mr._Stevenson fears -  the first_step on the slippery path downhill  to a U._N. without operational responsibilities and without effective meaning.
     The integrity of the office not merely requires that the Secretary_General shall be , as the Charter puts it ,  the chief administrative officer of the Organization  , but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority  external to the Organization .
   In_other_words , the Secretary_General is to be a nonpartisan , international servant , not a political , national one.
   He should be , as Dag_Hammarskjold certainly was , a citizen of the world.
     The Charter does stipulate that  due regard  shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on  as wide a geographical basis as possible .
   The United_States and its allies have had no objection to this.
   What they have objected to is the attempt of the Russians to make use of the tragedy of Dag_Hammarskjold 's death to turn the entire U._N. staff from the Secretary down into political agents of the respective countries from which they come.
     The controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic origin of the deputies of the Secretary_General and , more particularly , around the nature of his relationship with them.
   Although the United_States and the U._S._S._R. have been arguing whether there shall be four , five or six top assistants , the_most important element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the manner in_which these deputies are to do their work.
     If any one of them has any power to veto the Secretary_General 's decisions the nature of the organization will have changed.
   If they give him advice when he asks it , or if they perform specified duties under his direction , the nature of the U._N. will not of_necessity change.
   The Secretary_General must have , subject_to the constitutional direction of the Security_Council and the General_Assembly , the power to act , to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled by advisers and assistants acting_on someone else 's instructions.
     This is the root issue for which the United_States should stand.
   We should not become confused or let our public become confused over irrelevant questions of number or even of geography.
   What we must have , if the United_Nations is to survive , is as nonpolitical , nonpartisan an organization at the top as human_beings can make it , subject_to no single nation 's direction and subservient to no single nation 's ambition.
     The new City_Charter , which should get a Yes vote as Question No. 1 on Nov. 7 , would not make a good Mayor out of a bad one.
   There is no such magic in man-made laws.
   But it would greatly strengthen any Mayor 's executive powers , remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of inaction in the Board of Estimate , increase his budget-making authority both as to expense and capital budgets , and vest in him the right to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy.
     Lawmaking power is removed from the Board of Estimate and made a partnership responsibility of the City_Council and the Mayor.
   Thus there is a clearer division of authority , administrative and legislative.
   The board is diminished in both respects , while it retains control over zoning , franchises , pier leases , sale , leasing and assignment of property , and other trusteeship functions.
   The board will be able to increase , decrease , add or eliminate budget_items , subject_to the Mayor 's veto ; but the City_Council will now share fully this budget-altering power.
   Overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes will require concurrence by board and Council , and a two-thirds vote.
     The Controller retains his essential  fiscal watchdog  functions ; his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed.
   He loses now-misplaced tax_collection duties , which go to the Finance_Department.
   On net balance , in_spite_of Controller_Gerosa 's opposition to the new Charter as an invasion of his office , the Controller will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government than he has now.
     Borough Presidents , while retaining membership in the Board of Estimate , lose their housekeeping functions.
   Highways go to a new Department of Highways , sewers to the Department of Public_Works , such street cleaning as Borough Presidents now do ( in Queens and Richmond ) to the Sanitation_Department.
     Some fiscal changes are important.
   The expense ( operating ) budget is to be a program budget , and red_tape is cut to allow greater autonomy ( with the Mayor approving ) in fund transfers within a department.
   The capital budget , for construction of permanent improvements , becomes an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises ; but , as a second-look safeguard , each new project must undergo a Board of Estimate public hearing before construction proceeds.
     A road block to desirable local or borough improvements , heretofore dependent_on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on progress , is removed by making these a charge against the whole city instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected.
   This will have a beneficial effect by expediting public business ; it will also correct some injustices.
     Enlargement of the City_Council and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow.
     The Inter-american_Press_Association , which blankets the Western_Hemisphere from northern Canada to Cape_Horn , is meeting in New_York_City this week for_the_first_time in eleven years.
   The I._A._P._A. is a reflection of the problems and hopes of the hemisphere ; and in these days this inevitably means a concentration on the effects of the Cuban revolution.
     As the press in Cuba was gradually throttled by the Castro regime , more_and_more Cuban publishers , editors and correspondents were forced into exile.
   The I._A._P._A. found itself driven from journalism into politics as it did its best to bring_about the downfall of the Castro_Government and the return of the Cuban press to the freedom it knew before Batista 's dictatorship began in 1952.
     Freedom_of_the_press was lost in Cuba because of decades of corruption and social imbalances.
   In such conditions all freedoms are lost.
   This , in more diplomatic language , is what Adlai_Stevenson told the newspaper men of Latin_America yesterday on behalf of the United_States_Government.
   He felt able to end on a note of hope.
   He sees evidence of fair winds for the ten-year Alliance for Progress plan with its emphasis on social reforms.
   No group can contribute more to the success of the program than the editors and publishers of the Inter-American_Press_Association.
     The Twenty-second Soviet Communist_Party Congress opens in Moscow today in a situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago when this meeting was first announced.
   According to the original program , Premier_Khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the Kremlin this morning to be filled with_admiration or rage - depending_upon individual or national politics - because of the  bold program for building communism in our time  which the Congress will adopt.
   But far from being concerned about whether or not Russia will have achieved Utopia by 1980 , the world is watching Moscow today primarily for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear Armageddon in the immediate future.
     The evident contradiction between the rosy picture of Russia 's progress painted by the Communist_party 's program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by Premier_Khrushchev 's Berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that the program may be severely altered.
   Whether it is or not , the propaganda impact on the free_world of the document scheduled to be adopted at this meeting will be far less_than had been originally anticipated.
   And there must be many Soviet citizens who know what is going_on and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised for 1980 they and their children must first survive.
     This Congress will see Premier_Khrushchev consolidating his power and laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness remove him from the scene in the next few years.
   The widespread purge that has taken_place the past twelve months or_so among Communist leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who will dominate the Congress , and the Central_Committee it will elect , will all have passed the tightest possible Khrushchev screening , both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on_the_job.
     Dr._James_B._Conant has earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer.
   His earlier reports considered the American public_schools basically sound and not in need of drastic change.
   Now , a close look at the schools in and around the ten largest cities , including New_York , has shattered this optimism.
   Dr._Conant has come_away shocked and angry.
   His new book , entitled  Slums and Suburbs  , calls_for fast and drastic action to avert disaster.
     There is room for disagreement concerning some of Dr._Conant 's specific views.
   His strong opposition to the transfer of Negro children to schools outside their own neighborhood , in the interest of integration , will be attacked by Negro leaders who have fought for , and achieved , this open or permissive enrollment.
   Dr._Conant may underestimate the psychological importance of even token equality.
     His suggestion that the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical , law and graduate_schools will run_into strong opposition from these colleges themselves - even_though what he is recommending is already taking_shape as a trend.
     But these are side issues to a powerful central theme.
   That theme cuts through hypocrisies , complacency and double-talk.
   It labels the slums , especially the Negro slums , as dead-end_streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters.
   The villains of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters , and Dr._Conant accuses employers and labor_unions alike.
   The facts , he adds , are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling bad_conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration rather_than on real improvement of the schools , regardless_of the color of their students.
     A call for action  before it is too late  has alarming implications when it comes from a man who , in his previous reports on the schools , cautioned so strongly against extreme measures.
   These warnings must_not be treated lightly.
   Dr._Conant 's conscientious , selfless efforts deserve the nation 's gratitude.
   He has served in positions of greater glamour , both at_home and abroad ; but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward report on the state of the public_schools.
     A fascinating letter has just reached this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive so-called junk mail.
   He was delighted to learn that the Post_Office_Department is now going_to expand this service to deliver mail from Representatives in Congress to their constituents without the use of stamps , names , addresses or even zone numbers.
   In_accordance_with legislation passed at the last session of Congress , each Representative is authorized to deliver to the Post_Office in bulk newsletters , speeches and other literature to be dropped in every letter_box in his district.
   This means an added burden to innumerable postmen , who already are complaining of heavy loads and low pay , and it presumably means an increased postal deficit , but , our correspondent writes , think_of the additional junk mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on_a_regular_basis.
     Letter writing is a dying art.
   Occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and many are written by companies to one another , but these are mostly typewritten.
   Most mail these days consists_of nothing that could truly be called a letter.
    
    Old , tired , trembling the woman came to the cannery.
   She had , she said , heard that the plant was closing.
   It could n't close , she said.
   She had raised a calf , grown it beef-fat.
   She had , with her own work-weary hands , put seeds in the ground , watched them sprout , bud , blossom , and get ready to bear.
   She was ready to kill the beef , dress it out , and with vegetables from her garden was going_to can soup , broth , hash , and stew against the winter.
   She had done it last year , and the year before , and the year before that , and she , and her people were dependent upon these cans for food.
     This did not happen in counties of North_Georgia , where the rivers run and make rich the bottom land.
   Nor in South_Georgia , where the summer sun shines warmly and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields.
     This happened in Decatur , DeKalb_County , not 10 miles from_the_heart of metropolitian Atlanta.
     And now , the woman , tired and trembling , came here to the DeKalb_County cannery.
    Is it so the cannery is going_to close ?
     O._N._Moss , 61 , tall , grey as a possum , canning plant chief since 1946 , did n't know what to say.
   He did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this summer.
   He did say he was out of cans , the No.
3 's , but  I requisitioned 22000 .
   He said he had No.
2 's enough to last two_weeks more.
     Threat of closing the cannery is a recent one.
   A three-man committee has recommended to Commission_Chairman_Charles_O._Emmerich that the DeKalb_County cannery be closed.
   Reason : the cannery loses $ 3000 yearly.
     But DeKalb citizens , those who use the facilities of the cannery , say the cannery is not supposed to make any money.
      The cannery  , said Mrs._Lewellyn_Lundeen , an active booster of the cannery since its opening during the war and rationing years of 1941 , to handle the  victory_garden  produce ,  is a service to the taxpayer.
   And one of the best services available to the people who try to raise and can meat , to plant , grow vegetables and put them up.
   It helps those people who help themselves.
      The county , though , seems more interested in those people who do n't even try , those who sit and draw welfare checks and line_up for surplus food .
     A driver of a dairy truck , who begins work at 1 a. m. finishes before breakfast , then goes_out and grows a garden , and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family of five , asked ,  What in the world will we do ?
      What in the world  , echoed others , those come with the beans , potatoes , the tomatoes ,  will any of us do ?
     Moss , a man who knows how much the cannery helps the county , does n't believe it will close.
   But he is in_the_middle , an employe of DeKalb , but on_the_side of the people.
     The young married people ; the old couples.
   The dairy truck_driver ; the old_woman with the stew.
      Do n't ask me if I think the cannery helps  , he said.
    Sir , I know the cannery helps .
     Most_of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard.
   When a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or hardship it is not always easy to say ,  Just forget it .
   There is one thing I know ; a person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace as long as the heart holds a grudge.
   I know a man who held resentment against a neighbor for more_than three decades.
   Several years ago I was his pastor.
   One night , at the close of the evening service , he came_forward , left his resentment at the altar and gave his heart to God.
   After almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a_few feet over on his land.
      We tried to settle this dispute  , he said ,  but could never come_to an agreement.
   I settled it tonight  , he continued.
    I leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has been lifted off my heart , I have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven my neighbor .
     Forgiveness is the door through which a person must pass to enter the Kingdom_of_God.
   You cannot wear the banner of God and at_the_same_time harbor envy , jealousy and grudges in your heart.
   Henry_van_Dyke said ,  Forgive and forget if you can ; but forgive anyway .
     Jesus made three things clear about forgiveness.
   We must , first_of_all , be willing to forgive others before we can secure God 's forgiveness.
    For if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you : but if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses .
   Matthew 6 : 14 - 15.
   It will do no good to seek God 's forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong.
     Then , Jesus indicated that God 's forgiveness is unlimited.
   In the prayer Jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these words ,  Forgive us our debts .
   When a person meets God 's requirements for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven.
   God 's mercy and patience will last forever.
   Forgiveness implies more_than a person wanting his past sins covered by God 's love.
   It also implies that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past.
   We want the past forgiven , but at_the_same_time we must be willing for God to direct the future.
     Finally , we must be willing to forgive others as_many times as they sin against us.
   Once Peter asked ,  How oft shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him?
   Till seven times?
   Jesus saith unto him , until seventy times seven .
   Matthew 18 : 21 - 22.
     Jesus not_only taught forgiveness , He gave us an example of_it on the cross.
   With all the energy of his broken body he prayed ,  Father , forgive them , for they know not what they do .
   Luke 23 : 34.
     She 's been in and out of my house for a dozen years now , although she 's still a teen-ager who looks_like a baby , she is getting_married.
   Her mother , now dead , was my good friend and when she came to tell us about her plans and to show_off her ring I had a sobering wish to say something meaningful to her , something her mother would wish said.
   For_a_while there was such shrill girlish commotion I could n't have made myself heard if I 'd had the equivalent of the message to Garcia.
   But when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young female - six girls sprawled on one bed , drinking Cokes and giggling - she came_back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute.
      How do you know you love somebody enough to get_married ?
 she asked.
     It was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have ever asked : How can you be sure?
      Are n't you sure ?
   I asked , looking at her searchingly.
   I wanted to grab her by the arm and beg her to wait , to consider , to know for_certain because life is so_long and marriage is so important.
   But if she were just having a normal case of pre-nuptial jitters such a question might frighten her out of a really good marriage.
   Besides , in_all honesty , I do n't know how you can be sure.
   I do n't know any secret recipe for certainty.
   In the fevered , intoxicating , breathless state of being in_love the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships are sometimes obscured.
   I knew of but one test and I threw it out to her for what it was worth.
      Does he ever bore you ?
   I asked.
      Bore me ?
 she was shocked.
   Oh , no-o!
   Why , he 's so darling and & & & .
      I mean  , I went_on ruthlessly ,  when he 's not talking_about you or himself or the wonders of love , is he interesting?
   Does he care about things that matter_to you?
   Can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island for years and years and still find him fascinating?
     Because , honey , I thought silently , there are plenty of desert islands in every marriage - long periods when you 're hopelessly stranded , together.
   And if you bore each other then , heaven help you.
     She came_back the other day to reassure me.
   She has studied and observed and she is convinced that her young_man is going_to be endlessly enchanting.
     She asked if I had other advice and , heady with_success , I rushed it in , I hope not too late.
   Be friends with your mother-in-law.
   Jokes , cartoons and cynics to_the_contrary , mothers-in-law make good friends.
     I do not know Dr._Wilson_Sneed well.
   But I was deeply moved by his letter of resignation as rector of St._Luke 's Church in Atlanta.
   It was the cry of not just one heart ; it spoke_for many in the clergy , I suspect.
   The pulpit is a lonely place.
   Who stops to think_of that?
     Imagine the searching and the prayer that lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service to this majestic church.
    Such a church needs vigor and vitality in its rector and one man has only so_much of these endowments  , he told his members.
     A minister should not stay  beyond the time that his leadership should benefit  his church , he wrote ,  for he becomes ordinary .
     And so the young minister resigned , to go and study and pray , having never passed a day , he told his parishioners , when  I did not gain from you far more_than I ever gave to you .
     His very honest act called_up the recent talk I had with another minister , a modest Methodist , who said :  I feel so deeply blessed by God when I can give a message of love and comfort to other men , and I would have it no other way : and it is unworthy to think_of self.
   But oh , how I do sometimes need just a moment of rest , and peace , in myself .
     A man who gives himself to God and to the believers of his church takes upon himself a life of giving.
   He does not expect to get great riches or he would not have chosen to answer the call to preach.
   The good ones are not motivated to seek vainly , nor are they disposed to covet comfort , or they would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity.
   Theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards.
     Yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation of the infinite through him - we who readily accept his sacrifice as our due , we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul.
   We press him to conform_to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions with his word , and God 's.
   We do not defeat the good ones with this cruelty , but we add to their burden , while expecting them to bestow saintliness upon us in_return for ostentatious church attendance and a_few bucks a week , American cash.
   If we break the minister to our bit , we are buying back our own sins.
   If he won n't break , we add to the stress he bears.
     And a minister of all men is most conscious that he is mere man - prone to the stresses that earthly humanity is heir to.
   We expect him to be noble , and to make us so - yet he knows , and tries to tell us , how very humble man must be.
     We expect bestowal of God 's love through him.
   But how little love we give him.
   The church truly is not a rest_home for saints , but a hospital for sinners.
   Yet every Sunday we sinners go_to that emergency_room to receive first_aid , and we leave unmindful that the man who ministered to us is a human_being who suffers , too.
    
    Mr._Podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at Loon_Lake.
   The narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure.
     The evening was not always spent in the same way.
   This year , on a night cool with the front of September moving_in , but with plenty of summer still about , the Podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the Pod.
   The little cottage was bursting with people of all ages.
     In_the_midst of_it all , Mr._Podger came_out on the Pod porch , alone.
   He had that day attended a country auction , and he had come_back with a prize.
     The prize was an old-fashioned , woven cloth hammock , complete with cross-top pillow , fringed side pieces , and hooks for hanging.
   Mrs._Podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it , and there it was , slung in a vine-shaded corner , the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow , caressing movement.
     Mr._Podger sat_down in it , pushed himself back_and_forth in one or two slow , rhythmic motions , and_then swung his feet up into it.
   He closed his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly over him.
   Suddenly one young voice rose above the others.
    But  , it said ,  do you always know when you 're happy ?
     The voice sank back into the general tangle of sound , but the question stayed in Mr._Podger 's mind.
   Here , in the cool , autumn-touched evening , Mr._Podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly contented and at_peace.
     It had begun with the_blue jay feather.
   Walking along the lake before breakfast , Mr._Podger had seen the feather , and the_bird that had lost it in flight.
   The winging spread of blue had gone_on , calling harshly , into the wood.
   The small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet.
   All_day_long Mr._Podger , who was a straw-hat man in the summer , had worn the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield.
   Would a blue feather in a man 's hat make him happy all day?
   Hardly.
   But it was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning sunshine , linking the_blue of the sky with the_blue of the asters by the lake.
     Then , since the auction was being held nearby , he had walked to_it.
   And there , on_the_way , had been the box_turtle , that slow , self-contained , world-ignoring relic of pre-history , bent , for reasons best known to itself , on crossing the road.
   It was doing very_well , too , having reached the center , and was pursuing its way with commendable singleness of purpose when Mr._Podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a flashy little sports_car.
   Would the driver see the turtle?
   Would he take_pains to avoid it?
     Mr._Podger took_no_chances.
   Taking_off his hat and signaling the driver with_it , Mr._Podger stepped into the road , lifted the surprised turtle and consummated its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking suddenness.
     The turtle immediately withdrew into its private council room to study the phenomenon.
   But Mr._Podger and the driver of the sports_car waved at each other.
   Here in the cool darkness Mr._Podger could still feel the warmth of midday , could still see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road , could still see the friendly grin on the young , sun-browned face as the driver looked_back over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out_of_sight.
     Where was the driver now?
   What was he doing?
   And the turtle?
   Mr._Podger smiled.
   For a_few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama.
   The three would never meet again , but for_some_reason or other Mr._Podger was sure he would always remember the incident.
     Then there had been the auction itself.
   Mr._Podger heard again , at_will , the voice of the auctioneer , the voices of the bidders , and finally the small boy who had been so interested in Mr._Podger 's hammock purchase.
      I like them things , too  , he had said.
    We got one at_home.
   You know what?
   If you 're lyin ' out in the hammock at night , and it gets kinda cool - you_know - you just take these sides with the fringe on - see - and wrap ' em right over you.
   I do it , lots o ' times - I like to lie in a hammock at night , by myself , when it 's all quiet.
   The wind moves it a_little bit - you know .
     Mr._Podger had thanked him gravely , and now he made use of the advice.
   As he pulled the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon , Mr._Podger saw that thin , attractive , freckled little face again , and hoped that the boy , too , was lying in a cool , fringed-wrapped quiet.
     Alacrity , the Podger cat , came by the hammock , rubbed her back briefly against it , and_then , sure of a welcome , hopped up.
   She remarked that she found the night wind a_little chilly , and Mr._Podger took her inside the fringe.
   Soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree_crickets , rivaled the hum of voices from inside the Pod.
     Mr._Podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen_door opened and Pam burst_out.
    Dad !
 she said.
    It 's getting so chilly we 've lighted a fire , and we 're going_to tell a round_robin story - a nice , scary one.
   We need you to start it.
   Why are you out here all by yourself?
   Are n't you happy ?
     Mr._Podger opened his cocoon and emerged , tucking Alacrity under his arm to bring her in by the fire.
    Of_course I am  , he said.
    Never happier in my life.
   I just came out here to know it .
     As the South begins another school_year , national and even world attention is directed at the region 's slow progress toward racial equality in the public_schools.
     Desegregation is beginning in two more important Southern cities - Dallas and Atlanta.
   In each city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public_opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment.
     These programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully.
   The programs do not take sides on the issue itself.
   They point_out simply that  it is the law of the land .
     The two cities have the examples of Little_Rock and New_Orleans to hold_up as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation.
   Even better , they have the examples of Nashville and Houston to hold_up as peaceful and progressive programs.
     In each case there was an initial act of violence.
   In Nashville , a school was dynamited.
   In Houston , there were a_few incidents of friction between whites and Negroes , none of_which were serious.
     In each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government halted the threats of more serious incidents.
     The Nashville plan , incidentally , has become recognized as perhaps the_most acceptable and thus the_most practical to put into effect in the troubled South.
   It is a  stair-step  plan , in_which desegregation begins in the first_grade.
   Each_year another grade is added to the process , until finally all 12 grades are integrated.
   The schedules are flexible so_that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant or realizes that it is something that has to be done ,  so why not now .
     The program has worked well in both Nashville and Houston.
   It met a serious rebuff in New_Orleans , where the two schools selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by white parents.
   Another attempt will be made this year in New_Orleans to resume the program.
     Generally , throughout the South , there is a growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation is met.
     Perhaps the_most eloquent move toward removal of racial barriers has been in Dallas.
   During the summer , Negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments.
   It was part of a citywide move toward full integration.
     So successful has been this program , worked_out by white and Negro civic_leaders , that further extensions are expected in the next few months.
   Hotels , for_example , are ready to let_down the bars.
   Already , at_least one hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis.
   Several conventions have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis.
     This is a radical change in attitude from the conditions which prevailed several years ago , when a series of bombings was directed against Negroes who were moving_into previously all-white neighborhoods of Dallas.
     It is also symptomatic_of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the South.
   Southern whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence to try to stop Negroes from claiming equal rights.
   They insist they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in Alabama when the Freedom Riders sought to break_down racial discrimination in local bus_depots.
     All across the South there are signs that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant attitude toward it.
     There are many causes for this change.
   One of the_most important is economic.
   Business_leaders are aware now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence.
   They are putting strong pressure on their police_departments to keep order.
   In_the_past these same Southerners were inclined to look_the_other_way.
     And as the businessmen have begun to act , a real sense of co-operation has sprung_up.
   This co-operation has emboldened other Southern whites to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation.
   They realize that by acting in_concert , rather_than individually , they will not be picked_out as objects of retaliation - economic and otherwise.
     Since moving from a Chicago suburb to Southern_California a_few months ago , I 've been introduced to a new game called Lanesmanship.
   Played mostly on the freeways around Los_Angeles , it goes like this :     A driver cruising easily at 70 m. p. h. in Lane A of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic_jam ahead.
   Traffic in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes a tentative fender into Lane_B , which is heavily populated by cars also moving at 70 m. p. h..
     The adjacent driver in Lane_B has three choices open_to him.
   He can ( 1 ) point his car resolutely at the invading fender and force the other driver back into Lane A ; ( 2 ) slow_down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes ; or ( 3 ) alternately accelerate and decelerate , thus keeping the first driver guessing as to his intentions , thereby making a fascinating sport of the whole affair.
     The really remarkable thing to me is that most California natives unhesitatingly elect to slow_down and permit the invading car free access.
   Whether or not this is done out of enlightened self-preservation , I do n't know.
   But it is done , consistently and I 'm both surprised and impressed.
     This could never happen in my native Chicago.
   There such soggy acquiesence would be looked_upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood.
   In Chicago , the driver cut_out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor in an effort to force the other car back.
   Failing this , he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly.
     This negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways , however , does an injustice to Southern_California drivers.
   At the risk of losing my charge-a-plate at Marshall_Field and Company , I would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype.
   After three months of research , I can state unequivocally that Los_Angeles drivers are considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers I 've ever encountered.
     During one recent day of driving about Los_Angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull_out of an impossible side street.
    
    An out-of-town writer came_up_to Paul_Richards today and asked the Oriole manager if he thought his ball_club would be improved this year.
     Now Richards , of_course , is known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go.
   He can often make the complex ridiculously simple , and vice_versa.
   This happened to be vice_versa , but even_so , the answer was a masterpiece.
      It 's a whole lot easier  , he said ,  to increase the population of Nevada , than it is to increase the population of New_York_city .
   And with_that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher.
      That is undoubtedly a hell of a quote  , said the writer , scratching his head.
    Now , if I can just figure_out what he 's talking_about , I 'll use it .
     This was just Richard 's way of saying that last year the_Birds opened spring_training with a_lot_of jobs wide_open.
   Some brilliant rookies nailed them down , so_that this spring just two spots , left and right field , are really up for grabs.
     It should be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots that were open last year , but so_far it has n't worked that way.
     This angle of just where the Orioles can look_for improvement this year is an interesting one.
   You 'd never guess it from the way they 've played so_far this spring , but there remains a feeling among some around here that the Orioles still have a chance to battle for the pennant in 1961.
     Obviously , if this club is going_to move from second to first in the American_League , it will have to show improvement someplace.
   Where can that improvement possibly come from?
     You certainly can n't expect the infield to do any better than it did last year.
     Brooks_Robinson is great , and it is conceivable that he 'll do even better in 1961 than he did in 1960.
   You can n't expect it , though.
   Robby 's performance last year was tremendous.
     It 's the same with Ron_Hansen and jim Gentile.
   If they do as_well as they did in 1960 there can be no complaint.
   They should n't be asked to carry any_more of the burden.
     Hansen will be getting a late spring_training start , which might very_well set him back.
   He got_off to an exceptional start last season , and under_the_circumstances probably won n't duplicate it.
     There are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching to him last year.
   They do n't expect to stop him , just slow him down some with the bat.
   He 'll still be a top player , they concede , because he 's got a great glove and the long ball going_for him.
   But they expect to reduce his over-all offensive production.
     Gentile can hardly do better than drive_in 98 runs.
   Do n't ask him more.
     I have a hunch Marv_Breeding might move_up a notch.
   But even_so , he had a good year in 1960 and won n't do too_much better.
     So , all_in_all , the infield can n't be expected to supply the added improvement to propel the_Birds from second to first.
     And the pitching will also have trouble doing better.
   Richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and experience last season.
     Where , then , can we look_for improvement?
      From Triandos , Brandt and Walker  , answers Richards.
    They 're the ones we can expect to do better .
     The man is right , and at this time , indications are that these three are ready for better seasons.
     Triandos has n't proved it yet , but he says he 's convinced his thumb is all_right.
   He jammed it this spring and has had to rest it , but he says the old injury has n't bothered him.
   If he can bounce_back with one of those 25 home_runs years , the club will have to be better off offensively.
     I 'm still not convinced , though , I 'll have to see more of him before predicting that big year for him.
   Hank_Foiles , backed_up by Frank_House who will be within calling distance in the minors , make_up better second line catching than the_Birds had all last year , but Gus is still that big man you need when you start talking pennant.
     To me , Brandt looks as though he could be in_for a fine year.
   He has n't played too_much , because Richards has been working_on him furiously in batting practice.
   He 's hitting the ball hard , in the batting_cage , and his whole attitude is improved over this time last year.
     When he came to Baltimore , he was leaving a team which was supposed to win the National_League pennant , and he was joining what seemed to be a second division American_League club.
   He was down , hard to talk to , and far too nonchalant on the field.
   As of now , that all seems behind him.
   He 's been entirely different all spring.
     And Walker looks stronger , seems to be throwing better than he did last year.
   Let him bounce_back , and he could really set_up the staff.
     So , if the Orioles are to improve , Brandt , Triandos and Walker will have to do it.
     So_far the platoons on left and right_fielders do n't seem capable_of carrying the load.
     Of_course , this is n't taking into consideration the population of Nevada and New_York_city , but it 's the way things look from here at this point.
     Is the mother of an  autistic  child at_fault?
   ( The  autistic  child is one who seems to lack a well-defined sense of self.
   He tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects - and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people.
 )   Did his mother make him this way?
     Some people believe she did.
     We think differently.
   We believe that autism , like so many other conditions of defect and deviation , is to a large extent inborn.
   A mother can help a child adapt to his difficulties.
     Sometimes she can - to a large extent - help him overcome them.
   But we do n't think she creates them.
   We do n't think she can make her child defective , emotionally disturbed or autistic.
     The mother of a difficult child can do a great_deal to help her own child and often , by sharing her experiences , she can help other mothers with the same problem.
   Since little is known about autism , and almost nothing has been written for the layman , we 'd like to share one experienced mother 's comments.
   She wrote :      As the mother of an autistic child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything , I have to manipulate my son 's fingers for him when he first plays with a new toy.
   He wants me to do everything for him.
      You do n't believe that autistic children become autistic because of something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats them.
   But I do and my psychiatrist does , too.
   I know , that my son wants control and direction , but being autistic myself I cannot give full control or direction.
      One thing I notice which I have seldom heard mentioned.
   This is that autistic people do n't enjoy physical contact with others - for_instance , my children and I.
   When I hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is as straight and stiff as a board.
   He pushes and straightens himself as if he can n't stand the feeling of being held.
   Physical contact is uncomforatble for him !
     This mother is quite correct.
   As a rule , the autistic child does n't enjoy physical contact with others.
   Parents have to find other ways of comforting him.
   For the young child this may be no_more_than providing food , light or movement.
   As he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object ( his  magic  thing ).
   Or certain words or rituals that child and adult go_through may do the trick.
   The answer is different for each autistic child , but for most there is an answer.
   Only ingenuity will uncover it.
      Dear Doctors : We learned this year that our older son , Daniel , is autistic.
   We did not accept the diagnosis at_once , but gradually we are coming_to.
   Fortunately , there is a nursery_school which he has been able to attend , with a group of normal children.
      I try to treat Daniel as if he were normal , though of_course I realize he is far from_that at_present.
   What I do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as_much_as_possible.
   I try to give him as_many normal experiences as possible.
      What is your experience with autistic children?
   How do they turn_out later ?
     Many autistic children grow_up to lead relatively normal lives.
   Certainly , most continue to lack a certain warmth in communication with other people , but many adjust to school , even college , to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood.
     A first grader colors pictures one solid color , everything - sky , grass , boy , wagon , etc..
   When different colors are used , she is just_as likely to color trees purple , hair green , etc..
     The other children in the class use this same coloring_book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color.
   Should I show my daughter how things should be colored?
   She is an aggressive , nervous child.
   Is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow these traits?
     Her choice of one color means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring , without having reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects.
   This immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a_little immature for the first_grade.
     No , coloring is n't exactly something you teach a child.
   You sometimes give them a_little demonstration , a_little guidance , and suggestions about staying inside the lines.
   But most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only a very little demonstration.
     Seen in decorating circles of_late is a renewed interest in an old art : embroidery.
   Possibly responsible_for this is the incoming trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms , which seems slated to replace the one-color look to which we have been accustomed.
   Just_as a varitinted Oriental rug may suggest the starting_point for a room scheme , so may some of the newest versions of embroidery.
     One such , in_fact , is a rug.
   Though not actually crewel embroidery , it has that look with its over-stitched raised pattern in blue , pink , bronze and gold and a sauterne background.
   The twirled , stylized design of winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the embroidered patterns used so extensively for upholstery during the Jacobean period in England.
     Traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be appearing more_frequently this fall than in_the_past few years is still available in_this country.
   The work is executed in England ( by_hand ) and can be worked in any desired design and color.
     Among some recent imports were seat covers for one series of dining_room chairs on_which were depicted salad_plates overflowing_with tomatoes and greens and another set on which a pineapple was worked in naturalistic color.
     For a particularly fabulous room which houses a collection of fine English_Chippendale furniture , fabric wall panels were embroidered with a typically Chinese-inspired design of_this revered Eighteenth_Century period.
   Since the work is done by_hand , the only limitation , it is said ,  is that of human conception .
     Modern embroidered panels , framed and meant to be hung on the wall , are another aspect of_this trend.
   These have never gone_out of style in Scandinavian homes and now seem to be reappearing here_and_there in shops which specialize in handicrafts.
   An amateur decorator might try_her_hand_at a pair during the long winter evenings , and , by picking_up her living_room color_scheme , add a decorative do-it-yourself note to the room.
    
    California_Democrats this weekend will take the wraps off a 1962 model statewide campaign vehicle which they have been quietly assembling in a_thousand district headquarters , party clubrooms and workers ' backyards.
     They seem darned proud_of it.
     And they 're confident that the GOP , currently assailed by dissensions within the ranks , will be impressed by the purring power beneath the hood of_this grassroots-fueled machine.
     Their meeting at San_Francisco is nominally scheduled as a conference of the California_Democratic_Council directorate.
   But it will include 200 - odd officeholders , organization leaders and  interested party people .
     Out of_this session may come :     Plans for a dramatic , broad-scale party rally in Los_Angeles next December that would enlist top-drawer Democrats from all_over the country.
     Blueprints for doubling the CDC 's present 55000 enrollment.
     Arrangements for a statewide pre-primary endorsing convention in Fresno next Jan. 26 - 28.
     And proposals for a whole series of lesser candidate-picking conventions in the state 's 38 new Congressional_districts.
     At the head of the CDC is an unorthodox , 39 - year-old amateur politico , Thomas_B._Carvey_Jr. , whose normal profession is helping develop Hughes_Aircraft 's moon missiles.
   He 's approached his Democratic duties in hard-nosed engineering fashion.
     Viewed from afar , the CDC looks_like a rather stalwart political pyramid : its elected directorate fans_out into an array of district leaders and standing_committees , and thence into its component clubs and affiliated groups - 500 or_so.
     Much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every  volunteer  Democratic organization of any consequence belongs_to the CDC.
     Moreover , the entire state Democratic hierarchy , from Gov._Brown on down to the county chairmen , also participates in_this huge operation.
     Contrarily , Republican  volunteers  go their separate ways , and thus_far have given no indication that they 'd be willing to join_forces under a single directorate , except in the_most loose-knit fashion.
     Carvey believes that reapportionment , which left many Democratic clubs split by these new district boundaries , actually will increase CDC membership.
   Where only one club existed before , he says , two will flourish henceforth.
     Biggest organizational problem , he adds , is setting_up CDC units in rock-ribbed Democratic territory.
   Paradoxically the council is weakest in areas that register 4 - and 5 - to-1 in the party 's favor , strongest where Democrats and Republicans compete on a fairly even basis.
     Like most Democratic spokesmen , Carvey predicts 1962 will be a tremendously  partisan year .
   Hence the attention they 're lavishing on the CDC.
     In_all_probability , the council will screen and endorse candidates for the Assembly and for Congress , and_then strive to put its full weight behind these pre-primary favorites.
   This bodes heated contests in several districts where claims have already been staked out by Democratic hopefuls who do n't see eye-to-eye with the CDC.
     Naturally , the statewide races will provide the major test for the expanding council.
     Shunted aside by the rampant organizers for John_F._Kennedy last year , who relegated it to a somewhat subordinate role in the Presidential campaign , the CDC plainly intends to provide the party 's campaign muscle in 1962.
   There is evidence that it will be happily received by Gov._Brown and the other constitutional incumbents.
     Carvey considers that former Vice_President Nixon would be Brown 's most formidable foe , with ex-Gov._Knight a close second.
   But the rest of the GOP gubernatorial aspirants do n't worry him very_much.
     In his CDC work , Carvey has the close-in support and advice of one of California 's shrewdest political strategists : former Democratic National_Committeeman_Paul_Ziffren , who backed him over a Northland candidate espoused by Atty._Gen._Stanley_Mosk.
   ( Significantly , bitter echoes of the 1960 power struggle that saw Mosk moving_into the national committee post over Ziffren are still audible in party circles ).
     Note : We 've just received an announcement of the 54 th Assembly district post-reapportionment organizing convention Wednesday night in South_Pasadena 's War_Memorial_Bldg. , which graphically illustrates the CDC 's broad appeal.
   State_Sen._Dick_Richards will keynote ; state and county committeemen , CDC directors and representatives , members of 16 area clubs , and  all residents  have been invited.
     This is going_to be a language_lesson , and you can master it in a_few minutes.
   It is a short course in Communese.
     It works with English , Russian , German , Hungarian or almost any other foreign tongue.
   Once you learn how to translate Communese , much of each_day 's deluge of news will become clearer.
   At_least , I have found it so.
     For some compulsive reason which would have fascinated Dr._Freud , Communists of all shapes and sizes almost invariably impute to others the very motives which they harbor themselves.
   They accuse their enemies of precisely the crimes of_which they themselves are most guilty.
     President_Kennedy 's latest warning to the Communist world that the United_States will build_up its military strength to meet any challenge in Berlin or elsewhere was somewhat surprisingly , reported in full text or fairly accurate excerpts behind the Iron_Curtain.
   Then the Communese reply came_back from many mouthpieces with striking consistency.
     Now listen closely.
     Moscow radio from the Literary_Gazette in English to England.
      President Kennedy once_again interpreted the Soviet proposals , to sign a peace_treaty with Germany as a threat , as part of the world menace allegedly looming over the countries of capitalism.
   Evidently the war drum beating and hysteria so painstakingly being stirred_up in the West have been planned long in_advance.
   The West_Berlin crisis is being played_up artificially because it is needed by the United_States to justify its arms drive .
     The Soviet news_agency TASS datelined from New_York in English to Europe :      President Kennedy 's enlargement of the American military program was welcomed on Wall_Street as a stimulus to the American munitions_industry.
   When the stock_exchange opened this morning , many dealers were quick to purchase shares in Douglas , Lockheed and United_Aircraft and prices rose substantially.
   Over 4 million shares were sold , the highest figures since early June.
   ( Quotations follow .
 )     TASS datelined Los_Angeles , in English to Europe :      Former Vice_President Nixon came_out in support of President_Kennedy 's program for stepping_up the arms_race.
   He also demanded that Kennedy take additional measures to increase international tension : specifically to crush the Cuban revolution , resume nuclear testing , resist more vigorously admission of China to its lawful seat in the United_Nations , and postpone non-military programs at_home .
     TASS from Moscow in English to Europe :      The American press clamored for many days promising President_Kennedy would reply to the_most vital domestic and foreign problems confronting the United_States.
   In_fact , the world heard nothing but sabre-rattling , the same exercises which proved futile for the predecessors of the current President.
   If there were no West_Berlin problem , imperialist quarters would have invented an excuse for stepping_up the armaments race to try to solve the internal and external problems besetting the United_States and its NATO partners.
   Washington apparently decided to use an old formula , by injecting large military appropriations to speed the slow revival of the U._S. economy after a prolonged slump .
     And now , for Communist listeners and readers :     Moscow_Radio in Russian to the USSR :      The U._S._President has shown once_again that the United_States needs the fanning of the West_Berlin crisis to justify the armaments race.
   As_was_to_be_expected Kennedy 's latest speech was greeted with_enthusiasm by revenge-seeking circles in Bonn , where officials of the West German government praised it .
     Moscow_Novosti article in Russian , datelined London :      U._S. pressure on Britain to foster war hysteria over the status of West_Berlin has reached its apogee.
   British common_sense is proverbial.
   The present attempts of the politicians to contaminate ordinary Britons shows that this British common_sense is unwilling to pull somebody else 's chestnuts out of the fire by new military adventures .
     East_Berlin ( Communist ) radio in German to Germany :      A better position for negotiations is the real point of_this speech.
   Kennedy knows the West will not wage war for West_Berlin , neither conventional nor nuclear , and negotiations will come as certainly as the peace_treaty.
   Whenever some Washington circles were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they have always succumbed to pressure from the war clique in the Pentagon and in Bonn.
   In Kennedy 's speech are cross currents , sensible ones and senseless ones , reflecting the great struggle of opinions between the President 's advisers and the political and economic forces behind them.
   Well , dear listeners , despite all the shouting , there will be no war over West_Berlin .
     Moscow_TASS in Russian datelined Sochi :      Chairman Khrushchev received the U._S._President 's disarmament adviser , John_McCloy.
   Their conversation and dinner passed in a warm and friendly atmosphere .
     Now , to translate from the Communese , this means :     The  West_Berlin  crisis is really an East_Berlin crisis.
     The crisis was artificially stirred_up by the Kremlin ( Wall_Street ) and the Red_Army ( Pentagon ) egged_on by the West Germans ( East_Germans ).
     The reason was to speed_up domestic production in the USSR , which Khrushchev promised upon grabbing power , and try to end the permanent recession in Russian living standards.
     Chairman_Khrushchev ( Kennedy ) rattles his rockets ( sabre ) in_order_to cure his internal ills and to strengthen his negotiating position.
   His advisers in the Politburo ( White_House ) are engaged in a great struggle of opinions , so he is not always consistent.
     The Soviet_Union will fight neither a conventional nor a nuclear war over Berlin , and neither will its Warsaw_Pact allies.
   The West has no intention of attacking Russia.
     Chairman_Khrushchev and John_McCloy had a terrible row at Sochi.
     See , Communese is easy - once you get_onto it.
     Aug. 4 , 1821 , nearly a century after Benjamin_Franklin founded the Pennsylvania_Gazette - a century during which it had undergone several changes in ownership and a_few brief suspensions in publication - this paper made its first_appearance as the Saturday_Evening_Post.
   The country was now full_of Gazettes and Samuel_C._Atkinson and Charles_Alexander , who had just taken_over Franklin 's old paper , desired a more distinctive name.
     When founded by Franklin the Gazette was a weekly family newspaper and under its new name its format remained that of a newspaper but its columns gradually contained more_and_more fiction , poetry , and literary essays.
   In_the_middle of the century , with a circulation of 90000 , the Post was one of the_most popular weeklies in the country.
   But during the second_half of the century its fortunes reached a low point and when in 1897 Cyrus_H._K._Curtis purchased it -  paper , type , and all  - for $ 1000 it was a 16 - page weekly filled with unsigned fiction and initialed miscellany , and with only some 2000 subscribers.
     Little more_than a fine old name , valuable principally because of the Franklin tradition , the Saturday_Evening_Post was slow to revive.
   But Curtis poured over $ 1 million into it and in_time it again became one of the_most popular weeklies of the country.

     The 350 th anniversary of the King_James_Bible is being celebrated simultaneously with the publishing today of the New_Testament , the first part of the New_English_Bible , undertaken as a new translation of the Scriptures into contemporary English.
     Since it was issued in the spring of 1611 , the King_James_Version has been most generally considered the_most poetic and beautiful of all translations of the Bible.
   However , Biblical scholars frequently attested to its numerous inaccuracies , as old manuscripts were uncovered and scholarship advanced.
     This resulted in revisions of the King_James_Bible in 1881 - 85 as the_English Revised_Version and in 1901 as the American_Standard_Version.
   Then in 1937 America 's International_Council of Religious Education authorized a new revision , in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient manuscripts and languages.
   Undertaken by 32 American scholars , under the chairmanship of Rev._Dr._Luther_A._Weigle , former dean of Yale_University Divinity_School , their studies resulted in the publishing of the Revised_Standard_Version , 1946 - 52.
     The New_English_Bible ( the Old_Testament and Apocrypha will be published at a future date ) has not been planned to rival or replace the King_James_Version , but , as its cover states , it is offered  simply as the Bible to all those who will use it in reading , teaching , or worship .
     Time , of_course will testify whether the new version will have achieved its purpose.
   Bible reading , even more so than good classical_music , grows in_depth and meaning upon repetition.
     If this new Bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout the years , it will not survive the ages as has the King_James_Version.
     However , an initial perusal and comparison of some of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to speak well of the efforts of the_British Biblical scholars.
   One is impressed with the dignity , clarity and beauty of_this new translation into contemporary English , and there is no_doubt that the meaning of the Bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary language than in the frequently archaic words and phrases of the King_James.
     For_example , in the third chapter of Matthew , verses 13 - 16 , describing the baptism of Jesus , the 1611 version reads :      Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John , to be baptized of him.
      But John forbad him , saying , I have need to be baptized of thee , and comest thou to me?
      And Jesus answering said unto him , Suffer it to be so now : for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.
   Then he suffered him.
      And Jesus , when he was baptized went_up straightway out of the water : and lo , the heavens were opened unto him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove , and lighting upon him .
     Certainly , the meaning is clearer to one who is not familiar_with Biblical teachings , in the New_English_Bible which reads :  Then Jesus arrived_at Jordan from Galilee , and he came to John to be baptized by him.
   John tried to dissuade him.
   ' Do you come to me '?
   he said ; ' I need rather to be baptized by you '.
   Jesus replied , ' let it be so for the present ; we do_well to conform this way with all that God requires '.
   John then allowed him to come.
   After baptism Jesus came_up out of the water at_once , and at that moment heaven opened ; he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove to alight upon him  ;     ( the paragraphing , spelling and punctuation are reproduced as printed in each version.
 )     Among the_most frequently quoted Biblical sentences are the Beatitudes and yet so few persons , other_than scholars , really understand the true meaning of these eight blessings uttered by Jesus at the beginning of the Sermon_on_the_Mount.
     To illustrate , the first blessing in the King_James_Bible reads :  Blessed are the poor in spirit ; for their 's is the kingdom of heaven .
   The new version states :    How blest are those who know that they are poor ; the kingdom of Heaven is theirs .
     Some of the poetic cadence of the older version certainly is lost in the newer one , but almost anyone , with a fair knowledge of the_English language , can understand the meaning , without the necessity of interpretation by a Biblical scholar.
   To a novice that is significant.
     In the second and third chapters of Revelation the new version retains , however , the old phrase  angel of the church  which Biblical scholars have previously interpreted as meaning bishop.
   This is not contemporary English.
     For_the_most_part , however , the new version is contemporary and , as_such , should be the means for many to attain a clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds of years ago by the first followers of Christ.
     Originally recorded by_hand , these words have been copied and recopied , translated and retranslated through the ages.
   Discoveries recently made of old Biblical manuscripts in Hebrew and Greek and other ancient writings , some by the early church_fathers , in themselves called_for a restudy of the Bible.
   To have the results recorded in everyday usable English should be of benefit to all who seek the truth.
     There is one danger , however.
   With contemporary English changing with the rapidity that marks this jet age , some of the words and phrases of the new version may themselves soon become archaic.
   The only answer will be continuous study.
     The New_Testament offered to the public today is the first result of the work of a joint committee made_up of representatives of the Church_of_England , Church of Scotland , Methodist_Church , Congregational_Union , Baptist_Union , Presbyterian_Church of England , Churches in Wales , Churches in Ireland , Society_of_Friends , British and Foreign_Bible_Society and National_Society of Scotland.
     Prof._C._H._Dodd , 76 , a Congregational minister and a leading authority on the New_Testament , is general director of the project and chairman of the New_Testament panel.
    
    This is the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities and colleges schedule what they call  Homecoming Day .
   They seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes.
     The football opponent on homecoming is , of_course , selected with the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a Christian when thrown to one of the emperor 's lions.
   It is true , of_course , the uncertainties of life being what they are , that as now_and_then the Christian killed the lion , homecoming days have been ruined by a visiting team.
     Even with all possible precaution , homecomings are usually rather cruel and sad , and only the perpetually ebullient and the continually optimistic are made happy by them.
     More_often_than_not , as the Old_Grad wanders along the old paths , his memory of happy days when he strolled one of the paths with a coed beside him becomes an ache and a pain.
   He can smell again the perfume she wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter , and can smell again the aroma of autumn - fallen leaves , the wine of cool air , and the nostalgia of woodsmoke which blows through all the winds of fall.
     It is at precisely such moments that he encounters a_couple_of undergraduates , faces alight , holding hands and talking happily as they come_along , oblivious_of him , or throwing him the_most fleeting and casual of glances , such_as they would give a tethered goat.
   Usually , they titter loudly after they have passed_by.
     His dream goes.
   He feels , suddenly , the weight of the fat is on him.
   His bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous.
   His bifocals blur.
   His legs suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary , as if he had walked for miles , instead of strolling a_few hundred yards along the old campus paths.
   Bitterness comes_over him and the taste of time is like unripe persimmons in his mouth.
     It is not_much better if he meets with old classmates.
   Too often , unless he hails them , they pass him by.
   He recalls with a wry smile the wit who said , on returning from a homecoming reunion , that he would never go again because all his class had changed so_much they did n't even recognize him.
     If they do meet and recognize one another , slap backs and embrace , the moment soon is done.
   After_all , when one has asked whatever became of old Joe and Charlie ; when one has inquired who it was Sue_Brown married and where it is they now live ; when questions are asked and answered about families and children ; and old professors ; when the game and its probable outcome has been exhausted ; that does_it.
     By then one begins to notice the middle-age spread ; the gray hairs , the eyeglasses , bodies that are too thin or too heavy ; the fading signs of old beauty ; the athlete of by-gone years who wears a size 46 suit and puffs when he has finished a sentence of any length ; then , it is time to break it up and move_on.
     It is , if anything , worse on the old player.
     He sits in the stands and he does n't like that.
   Enough of his life was spent there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a spectator in the crowd.
   He always feels lonely.
   A team feels something.
   On a team a man feels he is a part of_it and akin to the men next to him.
   In the stands he is lonely and lost , no_matter_how many are about him.
     He sits there remembering the tense moment before the ball was snapped ; the churning of straining feet , the rasp of the canvas pants ; the smell and feel of hot , wet woolen sleeves across his face.
   He remembers the desperate , panting breath ; the long_runs on the kick-offs ; the hard , jolting tackles ; the breakthrough ; the desperate agony of goal-line stands.
   And so , he squirms with each play , remembering his youth.
     But it is no use.
   It is gone.
     No_matter_how often a man goes_back to the scenes of his youth and strength , they can never be recaptured again.
     Since the obvious is not always true , the Republican_National_Committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that it occurred , as suspected , in the larger cities.
     Of 40 cities with populations of 300000 and more , Mr._Kennedy carried 26 and Mr._Nixon 14.
   There are eight states in_which the largest urban vote can be the balance_of_power in any close election.
   These are New_York , Pennsylvania , Michigan , Maryland , Missouri , New_Jersey , Illinois and Minnesota.
   In 1952 Mr._Eisenhower won all_but Missouri.
   Yet , in 1960 all eight gave majorities to Mr._Kennedy.
     Republican research broke_down the vote in Philadelphia.
   Mr._Nixon , despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups , failed to do so.
   His visit to Warsaw , Poland , after the Russian journey in the summer of 1959 was expected to win the Polish vote which , in several cities , is substantial.
   Yet , the GOP breakdown discovered that in Philadelphia_Mr._Nixon received but 21 per_cent of the so-called  Polish  vote ; 30 per_cent of the  Irish  vote , and 18 per_cent of the  Negro  vote.
     A GOP  task_force ' committee will seek to find_out how its party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities.
     The task_force might make a start in Washington with Republican congressional leaders.
   These gentlemen already have done the party harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas and by their criticism of Mr._Kennedy for talking_about a recession and unemployment.
   This error was compounded by declaring the recession to be  a statistical one  , and not a reality.
   The almost six million persons without jobs and the two million working part-time do not consider themselves and their plight as statistical.
   They did not view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by Secretary of Labor_Goldberg as politics , which the GOP declared it to be.
   The people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take an interest in their misery.
     Senator_Mundt 's gross distortion of President_Eisenhower 's conversation into a denunciation of President_Kennedy as too left_wing , a statement Mr._Eisenhower declared to be entirely false , is another case_in_point.
   If the Republicans and Southern Democrats join to defeat medical_care for the old under the Social_Security program , they will thereby erect still another barrier to GOP hopes in the cities.
     The present Republican leadership as practiced by Mundt , Goldwater , Bridges , Dirksen , et al , is repeating the errors of the party leadership of the 1930 s.
   In_that decade the partisan zeal to defend Mr._Hoover , and the party 's failure to anticipate or cope_with the depression , caused a great majority of Americans to see the Republican_party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human_beings caught_up in the distress and suffering brought_on by the economic crash.
     The Republican_party was not lacking in humanity , but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear devoid_of any consideration for people in_trouble.
   Farmers called their mule-drawn pickup_trucks  Hoover carts .
   Smokers reduced to  the makings  , spoke of the sack tobacco as  Hoover dust .
     One may be sure the present Republican congressional leadership has n't meant to repeat this error.
   But it is in the process of so doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade John_F._Kennedy.
   That this is not good politics is underscored by the latest poll figures which show that 72 per_cent of the people like the way in_which the new President is conducting the nation 's business.
     The_most articulate Republicans are those who , in their desire to get_back at Mr._Kennedy , already have created the image of a Republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed and the unemployed , and which is even more unwilling to help old people who need medical_care.
   If they also defeat the school bill , the GOP task_force won n't have much research to do.
   It will early know why the party won n't win_back city votes.
     The 1962 General_Assembly has important business to consider.
   The tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in any responsible manner.
     After the Griffin-Byrd political troup has completed the circuit in November in the name of a Pre-Legislative_Forum , this is going_to be the_most politically oriented Legislature in history.
     Every legislator from Brasstown_Bald to Folkston is going_to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny as a test of his political allegiances , not his convictions.
     Hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system stands less chance than ever.
   And just how far can the Legislature go toward setting_up a self-insurance system for the state in_the_midst of a governor 's race ?
     How unpartisan will be the recommendations of Lt._Gov._Garland_Byrd 's Senate_Committee on Government_Operations?
     The situation already was bad because the Legislature moved the governor 's race forward a_few months , causing the campaigning to get_started earlier than usual.
     But when former Gov._Marvin_Griffin and Lt._Gov._Byrd accepted the invitations of the Georgia_State Chamber_of_Commerce to join the tour next November , the situation was aggravated.
     Neither had a choice other_than to accept the invitation.
   To have refused would have been political suicide.
   And it may be that one or both men actually welcomed the opportunity , when the bravado comments are cast_aside.
     The Georgia_State Chamber_of_Commerce tried to guard against the danger of eliminating potential candidates.
   It wanted the State_Democratic_Executive_Committee to pick the  serious candidates .
     But State_Party_Chairman_James_Gray of Albany said no , and he did n't mince any words.
    They are just asking too_much  , he said.
   We can n't think_of anyone else who would want to separate serious candidates from other candidates , either.
     There are other dangers :     Politics is an accelerating game.
    If an opponent accuses you of lying , do n't deny it.
   Say he is a horse thief  , runs an old adage.
     These men are spenders.
   If either one ever started making promises , there is no telling where the promises would end.
   Griffin 's Rural_Roads_Authority and Byrd 's 60000 miles of county contracts would look_like pauper 's oaths.
     The trouble is that at_first_glance the idea looks_like such a good one.
   Why not have them travel the state in November debating?
   It would present a forum for them in almost every community.
     But further thought brings the shuddery visions of a governor 's race being run in the next Legislature , the spectre of big spending programs , the ooze of mudslinging before the campaign should even begin.
   There is a way_out of_this.
   The Chamber has not arranged a pre-legislative forum.
   It has arranged a campaign_for_governor.
     If it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications are closed next spring , and_then carry all the candidates on a tour of debates , it can provide a service to the state.
     But the Legislature should be granted the opportunity to complete its work before choosing_up sides for the race.
     Former British Prime_Minister Attlee says Eisenhower was not a  great soldier .
   Ike 's somewhat like George_Washington.
   Both won a pretty fair-sized war with a modest assist from British strategy.
     Congressmen returning from recess say the people admire President_Kennedy so_much , they 're even willing to heed his call to sacrifice - and give_up his program.
     Slogan of the John_Birch_Society :  Paddle your own canoe.
   The guy who makes the motor boats may be a Communist .
     A Republican survey says Kennedy won the ' 60 election on the religious issue.
   Too many people were afraid if the GOP won , they 'd have to spend all their time praying.
    
    The Providence_Journal editorial ( Jan. 25 ) entitled  East_Greenwich Faces a Housing_Development Problem  points to a dilemma that faces communities such_as ours.
   Your suggested solution , it seems to me , is grossly oversimplified and is inconsistent with your generally realistic attitude toward , and endorsement of , sound planning.
     First_of_all there is ample area in East_Greenwich already zoned in the classification similar to_that which petitioner requested.
   This land is in various stages of development in several locations throughout the town.
   The demand for these lots can be met for_some_time to come.
   This would seem to indicate that we are trying neither  to halt an influx of migrants  nor are we  setting_up such standards for development that only the well-to-do could afford to buy land and build in the new sites .
     What we are attempting to do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low_density residential areas and industrial and commercial development.
   It is in_fact entirely consistent_with your suggestion of modest industrial development to help pay governmental costs.
   Bostitch , Inc. is approximately half_way through a 10 - year exemption of their real_estate tax.
   The wisdom of granting such tax exemptions is another matter , but this particular instance is , in my opinion , completely satisfactory.
   The 1960 tax book for East_Greenwich indicates a valuation for this property in_excess of two million dollars.
   With our current $ 3 per hundred tax_rate , it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you suggest a community should  try to develop a modest industrial plant  as the best way to meet these problems.
     In_order_to attract additional industry that is compatible with this community it is all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance in the tax structure.
   As this tax_base grows so then can your medium and low_density residential areas grow.
   Mr._Richard_Preston , executive_director of the New_Hampshire State_Planning and Development_Commission , in his remarks to the Governors_Conference on Industrial_Development at Providence on October 8 , 1960 , warned against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce the tax_rate or to underwrite municipal services such_as schools when he said :  If this is the fundamental reason for a community 's interest or if this is the basic approach , success if any will be difficult to obtain .
   He went_on to say :  In_the_first_place , industry per_se is not dedicated_to the role of savior of foundering municipalities.
   It is not in business for_the_purpose_of absorbing increased municipal costs no_matter_how high a purpose that may be .
     While Councilman_Olson cited the anticipated increase in school costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer , the impact upon a school_system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes to find alarm in uncontrolled growth.
   We in East_Greenwich have the example of two neighboring communities , one currently utilizing double sessions in their schools , and the other facing this prospect next year.
   It has already been reported in your newspapers that the East_Greenwich_School_Committee is considering additions to at_least one elementary_school and to the high_school to insure future accommodations for a school population that we know will increase.
   If they are to be commended for foresight in their planning , what then is the judgment of a town council that compounds this problem during the planning stage?
   Where then is the sound planning and cooperation between agencies within the community that you have called_for in other editorials?
   I submit that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are not facing the facts of life.
     The  fruitful course  of metropolitanization that you recommend is currently practiced by the town of East_Greenwich and had its inception long before we learned what it was called.
   For_example :     The East_Greenwich Police_Department utilizes the radio transmission facilities of the Warwick Police_Department , thereby eliminating duplication of facilities and ensuring police coordination in the Cowessett-East_Greenwich-Potowomut area of the two communities.
     The East_Greenwich_Fire_District services parts of Warwick as_well as East_Greenwich.
     The taxpayers of East_Greenwich appropriate sums_of_money , as do other Kent_County communities , for the support of the Kent_County_Memorial_Hospital , a regional facility.
     The East_Greenwich_Free_Library receives financial support from the town of East_Greenwich and the City of Warwick to supplement its endowment.
     Feelers were put_out last year to the City of Warwick , as reported in your newspapers , suggesting investigation of a common rubbish disposal area to service the Potowomut and Cowessett areas of Warwick along with East_Greenwich.
     East_Greenwich was one of the first Rhode_Island towns to enter into contract agreement with the Rhode_Island Development_Council for planning services we could not provide for ourselves.
     The education program for retarded children conducted by the East_Greenwich school_system has pupils from at_least one neighboring community.
     I feel compelled to write this because I am greatly concerned with the problem of community growth_rate and the relation between types of growth in a town such_as East_Greenwich.
   I believe it is an area in_which professional planners have failed to set adequate guide posts ; and yet they cannot ignore this problem because it concerns the implementation of nearly all the planning programs they have devised.
   These programs are volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must stand aside while land developers tell them when , where , and in_what_manner the community shall grow.
   We have far less to fear in the migrant family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions.
     Until professional planners meet this situation squarely and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts , I hope we in East_Greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny.
     I would like very_much , on behalf of my husband and myself , to send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful people responsible_for the Gabrielle_Fund.
     It is indeed true , as stated in the famous novel of our day ,  For Whom the Bell Tolls  , that  no man is an island , entirely of itself ; every man is a_piece of the continent , a part of the main .
     Thanks to the generosity of Mr._Irving_J._Fain , president of the Temple_Beth_El ; Rev._DeWitt_Clemens , pastor of the Mathewson_Street Methodist_Church ; Mr._Felix_Miranda , of the Imperial_Knife_Co. ; and to Mrs._Rozella_Switzer , regional director of The National_Conference of Christians and Jews , who asked them to serve as a committee for the fund.
   It is through them that we have become aware of the divine humanity in man , and therefore , that most people are noble , helpful and good.
     Bless you my friends , for it is through love and service that brotherhood becomes a reality.
     I am a sophomore at Mount_Pleasant High_School.
   My future plans are to become a language teacher.
   Of_course , having this desire , I am very interested in education.
     A_few weeks ago , I read in the Bulletin that there were to be given Chinese classes in Cranston.
   The article also said that a person had to be 18 years old or over , and must not be going_to high_school to attend these classes.
     The following week , I read in the Sunday paper that the students of Russia begin European and Asian languages in the seventh grade.
     I wish you could see the situation as I see it.
   If Russian pupils have to take these languages , how_come American students have a choice whether or not to take a language , but have to face so many exceptions?
     I do not think that America is like Russia , not in_the_least!
   I am proud of my country , the small city I live in , my wonderful parents , my friends and my school ; but I am also a young , able and willing girl who wants to study the Chinese language but is not old enough.
     Then people wonder why Russian pupils are more advanced than American students.
   Well , there lies your answer.
     At the height of the first snowstorm we had , it was impossible for me to get medical attention needed during an emergency.
     However , the East_Providence_Rescue Squad made its way through to my home in_time of desperation.
     Words cannot tell of the undivided attention and comfort their service gave to me.
   The concern they felt for me was such_as I shall never forget and for which I will always be grateful.
     The rescue squad is to be praised immensely for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather.
   Had they not gotten me to the hospital when they did , perhaps I would not be here to commend them at this time.
     Many thanks for a job well done.
     The Providence_Sunday_Journal article ( Jan. 29 ) asking whether American taxpayers are being victimized by a gigantic giveaway to pay for the care of war veterans who have non-service-connected disabilities sounds as though The Providence_Journal is desperate for news.
   Usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front page.
     On the question of admission to Veterans_Administration hospitals of service-connected and non-service-connected disabled veterans , it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly affected by war service.
   It can manifest itself before discharge from service , or it can come_out years later.
   There is one other point we should never lose sight of : Many veterans who enter VA hospitals as non-service cases later qualify as service-connected.
   No psychiatrist could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its effect in the ensuing years.
     The arguments advanced by those individuals and groups who oppose the system in_force and who would drastically curtail or do_away entirely with hospital_care for the non-service-connected case , seem to be coldly impractical and out-of-step with the wishes of the general public.
     I believe_in priority for service-connected disabled veterans in admission to VA hospitals.
   But I do n't believe we should close the door on nonservice-connected patients.
   This matter is of great importance , and the outcome may mean the difference between life or death , or at_least serious injuries , for many veterans.
     Some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital is too long.
   There 's a reason for this length of stay.
   First_of_all , the admitting physician in the VA hospital gets the patient as a new patient.
   He has no experience with this veteran 's previous medical_record.
   If the doctor is conscientious , he wants to study the patient.
   As a result , it takes a_little longer than it would on_the_outside where the family physician knows about the patient.
     Secondly , the VA physician knows that when the patient leaves the hospital , he is no_longer going_to have a chance to visit his patient.
   So he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects of treatment or surgery.
     The American public must be presented with the facts concerning VA hospitalization.
   The public should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a VA hospital , the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other.
   The responsibility is still going_to be there whether they pay for a VA hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital.
   An adequate system of VA hospitals is better equipped to care for the veterans than any 50 state hospitals.
     It seems that open season upon veterans ' hospitalization is once_more upon us.
   The American_Medical_Association is once_again grinding_out its tear-soaked propaganda based upon the high cost of the Veterans_Administration medical program to the American taxpayer.
   Do they , the A._M._A. , offer any solution other_than outright abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world?
     We veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand for medical_care at VA hospitals will grow proportionately as age fosters illness.
   Nevertheless , we wonder at the stand of the A._M._A. on the health_problem confronting the aged.
   They opposed the Forand bill , which would have placed the major burden of financial support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction ; yet they supported the Eisenhower administration which will cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars ( matched incidentally by a federal grant ) to initiate.
    
    No_doubt there have been moments during every Presidency when the man in the White_House has had feelings of frustration , exasperation , exhaustion , and even panic.
   This we can sympathetically understand.
   But no President ever before referred to his as a  lousy job  [ as Walter_Trohan recently quoted President_Kennedy as doing in conversation with Sen._Barry_Goldwater ].
     During his aggressive campaign to win his present position , Mr._Kennedy was vitriolic about this country 's  prestige  abroad.
   What does he think a remark like this  lousy  one does to our prestige and morale?
     If the President_of_the_United_States really feels he won himself a  lousy job  , then heaven help us all.
     Defense_Secretary_Robert_S._McNamara has asked Congress for authority and funds to build fallout shelters costing about 200 million dollars.
   Why should Congress even consider allowing such a sum for that which can give no protection?
     Top scientists have warned that an area hit by an atomic missile of massive power would be engulfed in a suffocating fire storm which would persist for a long_time.
   The scientists have also warned that no life above ground or underground , sheltered or unsheltered could be expected to survive in an area at_least 50 miles in_diameter.
     This sum spent for foreign economic aid , the peace_corps , food for peace , or any other program to solve the problems of the underdeveloped countries would be an investment that would pay_off in world peace , increased world trade , and prosperity for every country on the globe.
     Let us prepare_for peace , instead of for a war which would mean the end of civilization.
     It seems college is n't what it should be.
   I refer to the attire worn by the students.
   Upon a visit to a local junior_college last week , I was shocked to see the young_ladies wearing short shorts and the young_men wearing Bermuda_shorts.
     Is this what our children are to come face_to_face with when they are ready for college in a_few years?
   Education should be uppermost in their minds , but with this attire how can anyone think it is so?
   It looks more like they are going_to play at the beach instead of taking lessons on bettering themselves.
     High_school students have more sense of the way to dress than college_students.
   Many high_school students go_past my house every_day , and they look_like perfect ladies and gentlemen.
   No_matter_how hot the day , they are dressed properly and not in shorts.
     The granting of the Jan_Masaryk award August 13 to Senator_Paul_Douglas is a bitter example of misleading minorities.
     Douglas has consistently voted to aid the people who killed Masaryk , and against principles Masaryk died to uphold.
   Douglas has voted for aid to Communists and for the destruction of individual freedom [ public housing , foreign aid , etc.

     In today 's  Voice  , the CTA is urged to reduce fares for senior_citizens.
   Rising costs have increased the difficulties of the elderly , and I would be the last to say they should not receive consideration.
   But why is it the special responsibility of the CTA to help these people?
     Why should CTA regular riders subsidize reduced transportation for old people any_more than the people who drive their own cars or walk to work should?
   The welfare of citizens , old and young , is the responsibility of the community , not_only of_that part of_it that rides the CTA.
   CTA regulars already subsidize transportation for school children , policemen , and firemen.
     In_reply to a letter in today 's  voice  urging the sale of meat after 6 p. m. , I wish to state the other side of the story.
     I am the wife of the owner of a small , independent meat market.
   My husband 's hours away_from_home for the past years have been from 7 a. m. to 7 p. m. the early part of the week , and as late as 8 or 9 on week-ends.
   Now he is apparently expected to give_up his evenings - and Sundays , too , for this is coming.
     There is a trend to packaging meat at a central source , freezing it , and shipping it to outlying stores , where meat cutters will not be required.
   If a customer wishes a special cut , it will not be available.
   We are slowly being regimented to having everything packaged , whether we want it or not.
     Most women , in_this age of freezers , shop for the entire week on week-ends , when prices are lower.
   Also , many working wives have children or husbands who take_over the shopping chores for them.
     Independent market owners work six days a week ; and my husband has n't had a vacation in 14 years.
   No , we are not greedy.
   But if we closed the store for a vacation , we would lose our customers to the chain_stores in the next block.
     The meat cutters ' union , which has a history of being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area , represents the little corner markets as_well as the large supermarkets.
   What it is trying to do is to protect the little man , too , as_well as trying to maintain a flow of fresh meat to all stores , with choice of cut being made by the consumer , not the store.
     I , too , congratulate the American_Legion , of_which I am proud to have been a member for more_than 40 years , on the recent state convention.
     I regret that Bertha_Madeira [ today 's  Voice  ] obtained incorrect information.
   Had I been granted the floor on a point of personal privilege , the_matter she raised would have been clarified.
     The resolution under discussion at the convention was to require the boards of election to instruct judges to properly display the American flag.
   Judges under the jurisdiction of the Chicago board of election commissioners are instructed to do this.
     The resolution further asked that polling_place proprietors affix an attachment to their premises for the display of the flag.
     It was my desire to advise the membership of the Legion that the majority of polling_places are on private_property and , without an amendment to the law , we could not enforce this.
   My discussion with_reference_to the resolution was that we should commend those citizens who serve as judges of election and who properly discharge their duty and polling_place proprietors who make available their private premises , and not by innuendo criticize them.
   At_no_time did I attempt to seek approval or commendation for the members of the Chicago board of election commissioners for the discharge of their duties.
     The Illinois_Commission for Handicapped Children wishes to commend the recent announcement by the Catholic charities of the archdiocese of Chicago and DePaul university of the establishment of the Institute for Special_Education at the university for the training of teachers for physically handicapped and mentally_retarded children.
     In these days of serious shortage of properly trained teachers qualified to teach physically handicapped and mentally handicapped children , the establishment of such an institute will be a major contribution to the field.
     The Illinois_Commission for Handicapped Children , which for 20 years has had the responsibility of coordinating the services of tax supported and voluntary organizations serving handicapped children , of studying the needs of handicapped children in Illinois , and of promoting more adequate services for them , indeed welcomes this new important resource which will help the people of Illinois toward the goal of providing an education for all_of its children.
     I just want to let you know how much I enjoyed your June 25 article on Liberace , and to thank you for it.
   Please do put more pictures and articles in about Liberace , as he is truly one of our greatest entertainers and a really wonderful person.
     Is this , perhaps , one of the things that is wrong with our country?
     Engineering graduates of Illinois_Institute of Technology are reported receiving the highest average starting salaries in the school 's history - $ 550 a month.
     My son , who has completed two years in engineering_school , has a summer job on a construction project as an unskilled laborer.
   At a rate of $ 3.22 an hour he is now earning approximately $ 580 a month.
     Ironic , is it not , that after completing years of costly scientific training he will receive a cut in pay from what he is receiving as an ordinary unskilled laborer?
     [ Editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere on this page.
 ]     Your July 26 editorial regarding the position of Attorney_General Robert_F._Kennedy on prospective tax relief for du_Pont stockholders is based on an erroneous statement of fact.
   As a result , your criticism of Attorney_General Robert_F._Kennedy and the department_of_justice was inaccurate , unwarranted and unfair.
     The editorial concerned legislative proposals to ease the tax burden on du_Pont stockholders , in connection with the United_States Supreme_court ruling that du_Pont must divest itself of its extensive General Motors stock holdings.
   These proposals would reduce the amount of tax that du_Pont stockholders might have to pay - from an estimated 1.1 billion dollars under present law to as little as 192 million dollars.
     Congressman_Wilbur_D._Mills , chairman of the House Ways and Means committee , asked the department_of_justice for its views on these legislative proposals as they related to anti-trust law_enforcement.
   The attorney_general responded by letter dated July 19.
   Copies of_this letter were made available to the press and public.
     In_this letter , Mr._Kennedy made it clear that he limited his comment only to one consideration - what effect the legislative proposals might have on future anti-trust judgments.
   There are a_number_of other considerations besides this one but it is for the Congress , not the department_of_justice , to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation.
     Yet your editorial said :  Now the attorney_general writes that no considerations ' justify any loss of revenue of_this proportion  '.
   What Mr._Kennedy , in_fact , wrote was :  It is the department 's view that no anti-trust enforcement considerations justify any loss of revenue of_this proportion .
     The editorial , by omitting the words anti-trust enforcement , totally distorted Mr._Kennedy 's views.
   The headline is offensive , particularly in_view of the total inaccuracy of the editorial.
     I concur most heartily with today 's letter on the futility of writing to Sen._Dirksen and Sen._Douglas.
     But when you write to Congresswoman_Church , bless her heart , your letter is answered fully and completely.
   Should she disagree , she explains why in_detail.
   When she agrees , you can rest assured her position will remain unchanged.
     I think we have the hardest working , best representative in Congress.
     A recent news_story reported that Frank_Sinatra and Dean_Martin delayed 103 airplane passengers 10 minutes in London while they finished their drinks.
     They do our country great harm by such actions.
   Those in_the_public_eye should be good_examples of American citizens while abroad.
     The plane should have started at the scheduled time and left Sinatra and Martin to guzzle.
     Overt socialism means government ownership and management of a nation 's main industries.
   In covert socialism - toward which America is moving - private enterprise retains the ownership title to industries but government thru direct intervention and excessive regulations actually controls them.
     In_order_to attract new industries , 15 states or more are issuing tax free bonds to build government owned plants which are leased to private enterprise.
   This is a step toward overt socialism.
     Issuing bonds for plant construction has brought new industries to certain regions.
    
    Sir - We are writing in reference_to a recent  suggestion  made to the staff of the Public_Health_Nursing_Service of Jersey_City ( registered professional nurses with college background and varying experiences ).
   The day before Election_Day , to_which we are entitled as a legal_holiday , we were informed to report to our respective polls to work as  workers of the party .
     Being ethical and professional people interested in community health and well-being , we felt this was n't a function of our position.
   Such tactics reek of totalitarianism!
   As we understand , this directive was given to all city and county employes.
     To our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed because of political affiliation.
   We , therefore , considered the  suggestion  an insult to our intelligence , ethics , Bill_of_Rights , etc..
   Our only obligation for this day is to vote , free_of persuasion , for the person we feel is capable in directing the public.
     This is our duty - not as nurses or city employes - but as citizens of the United_States.
     Sir - I read of a man who felt he should not build a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters.
   Does this man live in a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves , but ready_to demand that  the community  help and protect them?
     Community shelters are , of_course , necessary for those having no space for shelter.
   If in a town of 2000 private homes , half of them have shelters , the need for the community shelters will be reduced to that extent.
     In designing his home fallout shelter there is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that home 's occupants ,  plus-one  - so he will be able to take_in a stranger.
   I hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes will have a change of heart , will get busy and be the first member of our  plus-one  shelter club.
     Sir - People continue to inquire the reason for the race for outer_space.
   It 's simple enough from my point_of_view.
   I am for it.
     It is the only method left for a man to escape_from a woman 's world.
     Sir - When the_colonies decided upon freedom from England , we insisted , through the Declaration_of_Independence , that the nations of the world recognize us as a separate political entity.
   It is high_time the United_States began to realize that the God-given rights of men set_forth in_that document are applicable today to Katanga.
     In the United_Nations Charter , the right of self-determination is also an essential principle.
   This , again , applies to Katanga.
   The people of Katanga had fought for , and obtained , their freedom from the Communist yoke of Antoine_Gizenga , and his cohorts.
   By political , economic , geographic and natural standards , they were justified in doing so.
     The United_States and the U._N. denounce their own principles when they defend the Communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge the right of self-determination of the Katangans.
     Sir - Permit me to commend your editorial in_which you stress the fact that a program of county colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers have a right to a clear idea of_what such a program would commit them to.
     The bill which passed the Assembly last May and is now pending in the Senate should be given careful scrutiny.
   The procedure for determining the amounts_of_money to be spent by county colleges and raised by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers.
     Under the proposal the members of the board_of_trustees of a county college will be appointed ; none will be elected.
   The trustees will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board of school estimate.
   This board will consist_of two of the trustees of the college , and the director and two members of the board of freeholders.
   It will determine the amount_of_money to be spent by the college and will certify this amount to the board of freeholders , which  shall appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations are made by it the amount so certified and the amount shall be assessed , levied and collected in the same manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes .
     The approval of only three members of the board of school estimate is required to certify the amount_of_money to be allotted to the college.
   Since two of these could be trustees of the college , actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected_official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax_revenue.
   This is taxation without representation.
     Sir - Your editorial ,  Housing Speedup  , is certainly not the answer to our slum problems.
   The very rules and regulations in every city are the primary case of slum conditions.
     Change our taxing law so_that no tax shall be charged to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties.
   Then see what a boom in_all trades , as_well as slum clearance at no cost to taxpayers , will happen.
   Our entire economy will have a terrific uplift.
     Sir - An old_man is kicked to death by muggers.
   The medical_examiner states that death was due to  natural causes .
     I once heard a comedian say that if you are killed by a taxicab in New_York , it is listed as  death due_to natural causes .
     Sir - Every resident of_this city should visit the Newark_Museum and see the exhibit  Our Changing Skyline in Newark .
   It will be at the museum until March 30.
     It is a revelation of_what has been done , what is being done and what will be done in Newark as shown by architects ' plans , models and pictures.
   It shows what a beautiful city Newark will become and certainly make every Newarker proud_of this city.
     It should also make him desire to participate actively in civic , school and religious life of the community so_that that phase of Newark will live_up_to the challenge presented by this exhibit.
     Sir - I hasten to join in praise of the men in the toll booths on the Garden_State Parkway.
   Recently I traveled the parkway from East_Orange to Cape_May and I found the_most courteous group of men you will find anywhere.
   One even gave my little_dog a biscuit.
   It was very refreshing.
     The viewers of the  deep Peep_Show  at 15 th and M streets nw. have an added attraction - the view of a fossilized cypress swamp.
   Twenty feet below the street level in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site , a black coal-like deposit has been encountered.
     This is a black swamp clay in_which about one_hundred million years ago cypress-like trees were growing.
   The fossilized remains of many_of these trees are found embedded in the clay.
   Some of the stumps are as much_as three feet long , but most_of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying sediments.
   Although the wood has been changed to coal , much of_it still retains its original cell structure.
     In the clay are entombed millions of pollen grains and spores which came from plants growing in the region at_the_time.
   These microfossils indicate the swamp was  formed during the Lower Cretaceous_period when dinosaurs were at their heyday and when the first flowering_plants were just appearing.
     The 15 th Street deposit is not to be confused with the nearby famous Mayflower_Hotel cypress swamp on 17 th Street reported in The Washington_Post , August 2 , 1955 , which was probably formed during the second interglacial period and is therefore much younger.
     Recently the secretary of the Friends Committee on National Legislation was interviewed on the air.
   While I respect his sincere concern for peace , he made four points that I would like to question.
     He said ,  Let 's work for peace instead of protection from aggression .
   I would ask ,  Why not do both ?
   Military power does not cause war ; war is the result of mistrust and lack of understanding between people.
   Are we not_late , especially those of us who call ourselves Friends , in doing enough about this lack of understanding?
     As to protection , the speaker disapproved of shelters , pointing_out that fallout shelters would not save everyone.
   Is this a reason for saving no one?
   Would the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his boat could not pick_up everyone?
     The speaker suggested that the desolation of a post-attack world would be too awful to face.
   If the world comes to this , would n't it be the very time when courage and American know-how would be needed to help survivors rebuild?
   Many_of our young people think it would.
     Lastly , the speaker decried our organized program of emergency help calling it  Civilian_Defense .
   In 1950 , Public_Law 920 created Civil_Defense ( different from Civilian-groups of World_War 2 , ) , a responsibility of the Government at_all levels to help reduce loss of life and property in disaster , natural or manmade.
     Far from creating fear , as the speaker suggests , preparedness - knowing what to do in an emergency - gives people confidence.
   Civil_Defense has far to go and many problems to solve , but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer tradition to be not_only willing , but prepared to care for our own families and help our neighbors in any disaster - storm , flood , accident or even war?
     It seems rather peculiar that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves with the protection and companionship of dogs.
   I feel that few burglars would be prone to break and enter into someone 's apartment if they were met with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide.
   In_addition , would not the young female public of Washington be afforded a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash?
     I grant that the dog may not be really protective , based on his training , but if you were roaming the streets looking_for a purse to snatch or a young_lady to molest , how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with a dog?
   I would like to suggest that the landlords and Commissioners get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting dogs in apartments.
     Use the terraces of the Capitol for a sidewalk cafe?
   Could Senator_Humphrey be serious in his proposal?
   Is nothing in_this country more sacred than the tourists ' comfort?
     Perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could be extended.
   The Lincoln and Jefferson_Memorials are rather bleak.
   Why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel too far to eat?
   Unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money to support themselves during the off season.
   As an added suggestion to balance the budget , the Government could sell advertising space on the Washington_Monument.
   It is visible throughout the city , and men from Madison_ave. would jump at the chance.
     Sen._Hubert_Humphrey is obviously a man with a soul and heart.
   He , like most_of us , wants to be able to sit , to contemplate and be moved by the great outdoors.
   Let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas around fountains and gardens.
   Let us , like the_French , have outdoor cafes where we may relax , converse at_leisure and enjoy the passing crowd.
     Two strong dissents from the majority report of the Joint_Economic_Committee ( May 2 ) by Senators Proxmire and Butler allege that the New_Deal fiscal policy of the Thirties did not work.
    
    For_the_first_time in history the entire world is dominated_by two large , powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear_weapons that make conventional warfare of the past a nullity.
   The United_States and Soviet_Russia have enough nuclear_weapons to destroy all nations.
   Recent statements by well-known scientists regarding the destructive power of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead of negotiations.
     President_Kennedy was right when he said ,  We shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate .
   I have just returned from a seven-week trip to Europe and the Far_East.
   It is quite evident that the people of Western Europe are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war.
   The fact is that the Italians , French and British know that they have no defense against nuclear bombs.
   We have no right to criticize them , as they realize they would be sitting_ducks in a nuclear war.
     We should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access into Berlin.
   It would be criminal folly if the Communists tried to prevent us.
   But there is nothing we can do to stop Soviet_Russia from granting de_facto recognition to East_Germany.
   Soviet_Russia has been invaded twice by German troops in a generation.
   In the last war Russia lost more_than ten million killed and its lands and factories were devastated.
     The truth is that Communist_Russia fears the resurgence of German militarism.
   Berlin is merely being used by Moscow as a stalking_horse.
   Actually , the Communists , out of fear of a united and armed Germany , would probably be willing to agree to a disarmed Germany that would be united and neutral and have its independence guaranteed by the U._N..
     If the Communists are sincere in wanting a united , neutral and disarmed Germany , it might well be advantageous for the German people in_this nuclear age.
   It could provide security without cost of armaments and increase German prosperity and lessen taxation.
   France and other Western European_nations likewise fear a rearmed Germany.
   If the German people favor such a settlement we should not oppose Germany following the example of Austria.
     President_Kennedy has urged a peace race on disarmament that might be called  Operation_Survival  which has many facets.
   Why not make a beginning with a united and disarmed Germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing would be guaranteed by the Big Four powers and the United_States?
   A united Germany , freed of militarism , might be the first step toward disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world.
     In your editorial of Sept. 30  The Smoldering Congo  you make the following comment :  Far too many states are following the Russian example in refusing to pay their assessments.
   It is up_to the Assembly to take action against them.
   They are violating their Charter obligation , the prescribed penalty for which is suspension of membership or expulsion .
     I would like to quote from the Charter of the United_Nations :      Article 17 , Section 1 : The General_Assembly shall consider and approve the budget of the Organization.
      Section 2 : The expenses of the Organization shall be borne by the Members as apportioned by the General_Assembly.
      Article 19 : A Member of the United_Nations which is in_arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the Organization shall have no vote in the General_Assembly if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions due from_it for the preceding two full years .
     The U._S._S._R. and her followers are careful in paying their obligations to the regular budget.
   But they refuse , as do the Arab states , to support the United_Nations ' expenses of maintaining the United_Nations Emergency_Force in_the_Middle East as a buffer between Egypt and Israel , and the U._N. troops in the Congo , which expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the United_Nations , but by a special budget.
     According to the official interpretation of the Charter , a member cannot be penalized by not having the right_to_vote in the General_Assembly for nonpayment of financial_obligations to the  special  United_Nations ' budgets , and of_course cannot be expelled from the Organization ( which you suggested in your editorial ) , due_to the fact that there is no provision in the Charter for expulsion.
     In your Sept. 27 editorial appraisal of the work of the First Session of the Eighty-seventh_Congress you referred to the lack of  consciousness of destiny in a time of acute national and world peril .
   Yet your list of things left undone did not include repeal of the Connally amendment to this country 's domestic jurisdiction reservation to its Adherence to the Statute of the International_Court_of_Justice.
     The Connally amendment says that the United_States , rather_than the court , shall determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the United_States in a case before the World_Court to_which the United_States is a party.
   If the case is thus determined by us to be domestic , the court has no jurisdiction.
     Since the Connally amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other party to a dispute with the United_States , it also prevents us from using the court effectively.
   Yet although the Kennedy_Administration , and the Eisenhower_Administration before it , have both declared themselves solidly for repeal of the Connally amendment , as contrary to our best interests , no action has yet been taken.
     Our  destiny  in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit of peace , with justice , under law.
   To achieve this destiny , acts as well as words are needed - not_only acts that lead to physical strength but also acts that lead to strength based on right doing and respect.
     What better affirmative step could be taken to this end than repeal of the Connally amendment - an act which could expose the United_States to no practical risk yet would put an end to our self-judging attitude toward the court , enable us to utilize it , and advance in a tangible way the cause of international_law and order?
     We believe that the list of vital things left undone to_date by the Eighty-seventh_Congress should have included repeal by the Senate of the Connally amendment.
     Many home-bound subway riders utilizing the Flushing-Main_Street express are daily confronted with the sight of the local departing from the Woodside station as their express comes_to a stop , leaving them stranded and strained.
   To the tens of thousands who must transfer to ride to Seventy-fourth_Street and change for the IND , this takes a daily toll of time and temper.
     The Transit_Authority has recently placed in_operation  hold  lights at BMT_Thirty-ninth and Fifty-ninth_Street stations in Brooklyn.
   This  holds  the local until the express passengers change trains.
   Without question , this time and temper saver should be immediately installed at the Woodside station.
     As a business man I have to use the telephone constantly , from three to four hours a day.
     In the last few years the telephone_company has managed to automate many areas of their service.
   It has not been any great mental effort on my part to keep_up with this mechanization which has brought_about new ways of dialing.
     However , there are still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone_operators.
   I have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the young_ladies who are servicing person-to-person calls , special long-distance_calls , etc..
   Either it is lack of training , lack of proper screening when hiring , lack of management or possibly lack of interest on the part of the telephone_company , which does have a Government-blessed monopoly.
     I disagree with the writer who says funeral services should be government-controlled.
   The funeral for my husband was just what I wanted and I paid a fair price , far less_than I had expected to pay.
   But the hospitals and doctors should be.
     Recently I visited the very remarkable Pilgrim_School for retarded children.
     Hazel_Park donates its recreation center , five days a week , to the school.
   There is no charge and no state aid.
   Kiwanis , American_Legion and other groups donate small sums and the mothers do what they can to bring_in dollars for its support.
     There are 70 children there and the mothers donate one_day a week to the school.
   Reading , writing and simple arithmetic are taught along with such crafts as working in brass.
   They make beautiful objects.
     Enough trading_stamps were collected to buy a 12 - passenger station_wagon.
   Southfield schools furnish an old 45 - passenger bus ( the heater in_which needs repair since some of the children ride a long distance and need the heat ).
     The school is located at 9 - 1 2 Mile road , Woodward_Heights.
   Visitors are welcome to come see what these dedicated mothers can do.
     I was surprised at Mayor_Miriani 's defeat , but perhaps Mayor-elect_Cavanagh can accomplish some things that should have been done years ago.
   Maybe he can clean_out the white_elephants in some of the city departments such_as welfare , DPW and sanitation.
   Negligence in garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning is great.
     He should put the police back to patrolling and walking the streets at night.
   There should be better bus_service and all_of our city departments and their various branches need a general and complete overhauling.
     Our litterbug ordinances are not enforced and I have yet to read of a conviction in a littering case.
     Drunken truck_drivers in the city departments should be weeded_out.
   Educate the city employes to give real service to the public.
   After_all , they are paid by the public , they should be examples.
     At a recent meeting of the Women 's Association of the Trumbull_Ave._United Presbyterian_Church , considerable use was made of material from The Detroit_News on the King_James_version of the New_Testament versus the New_English_Bible.
     Some members of the organization called attention also to the article on hymns of inspiration , the Daily_Prayer and Three Minutes a Day , as being very helpful.
     We feel that The Detroit_News is to be complimented upon arranging for articles on these subjects and we hope that it will continue to provide material along wholesome lines.
     Thank_you for the article by George_Sokolsky on the public apathy to impudence.
     How old do you have to be to remember when Americans , especially children , were encouraged to be polite?
   Why has this form of gentility gone_out of American life?
     How can we old-fashioned parents , who still feel that adults are due some respect from children , battle the new type of advertising that appears on TV without denying the children the use of television entirely?
   Writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of  modern  parents they have observed.
   From necessity , they are also inspired by the  hard-sell  attitude of the sponsor , so , finally , it is the sponsor who must take the responsibility for the good or bad taste of his advertising.
     I commend Senator_Hart for his brave fight to establish a national_park in the dunes area.
    
    I just wish to congratulate Inspector_Trimmer and his efficient police troops in cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles.
   We have now a quiet city , fewer automobiles , less congestion , and fewer retail customers shopping in center city.
   Good for Mr._Trimmer.
   Maybe he will help to turn our fair city into a  ghost  town.
     I worked_on the Schuylkill_Expressway and if it had not been for the big trucks carrying rock and concrete there would n't be an Expressway.
   Without these massive trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future.
     Mr._George_Hough ( Oct. 30 ) sounds like a business man who waits until the last minute to leave his home or shop.
   The trucks today help pay for this highway.
   They try to keep within the speed_limits.
   Although today 's trucks are as fast as passenger_cars , a truck_driver has to be a sensible person and guard against hogging the road.
     The letter_writer who suggested saving money by taking kids out of school at 14 should have signed his letter  Simpleton  instead of  Simplicitude .
   Such kids only wind_up among the unemployed on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden.
   There are lots_of jobs available for trained high_school graduates , but not for the dropouts.
   What we need is more vocational training in high_schools , not more dropouts.
     I suppose I am missing some elementary point but I honestly cannot see how two wrongs can make a right!
   I am referring to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because Russia is.
   Will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less harmful to future generations of children?
   If an atom_bomb in 1945 could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have is more_than adequate_to fulfill any military objective required of_it.
     As I see it , if war starts and we survive the initial attack enough to be able to fight_back , the nuclear_weapons we now have - at_least the bombs - can inflict all the demage that is necessary.
   Why do we need bigger and better bombs?
   I repeat , two wrongs do not make a right.
     Everyone should take time to read Martin_Luther 's Hymn  A Mighty_Fortress Is Our God .
     Especially the first_half of the third verse.
     To our everlasting shame , we led the world in_this nuclear arms_race sixteen years ago when we dropped the first bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
     Having led the world in_this mad race I pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead it out of the race.
     Are we to be the master of the atom , or will the atom be our master - and destroy us!
     Just because Cheddi_Jagan , new boss of British_Guiana , was educated in the United_States is no reason to think he is n't a Red.
   We have quite_a_few home-grown specimens of our own.
   If we go_all_gooey over this newest Castro ( until he proves he is n't ) we 've got rocks in our heads.
   How many_times must we get burned before we learn?
     Just to remind the Communists that the bombs dropped on Japan were to end a war not start one.
   The war could have continued many years with many thousands killed on both sides.
   Intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets of destruction are frightening whether they fall on Japan , London or Pearl_Harbor.
   That is why the United_Nations was formed so_that intelligent men with good intentions from all countries could meet and solve problems without resorting to war.
     Russia has showed its intentions by exploding bombs in peace time to try to frighten the world.
   Why are n't the Soviets expelled from the U._N.?
     While  better late than never  may have certain merits , the posthumous award of the Nobel_Prize for Peace to the late Dag_Hammarskjold strikes me as less_than a satisfactory expression of appreciation.
   Had it been bestowed while the Secretary_General of the United_Nations was living , unquestionably he would have been greatly encouraged in pursuing a difficult and , in many ways , thankless task.
     According to one report , however , Mr._Hammarskjold was considered  too controversial  a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last spring.
   Actually , of_course , that label  controversial  applied only because he was carrying_out the mandate given him by the world_organization he headed rather_than following the dictates of the Soviet_Union.
     At Khrushchev 's door , therefore , can be placed the primary blame but also at_fault are those who permitted themselves to be intimidated.
   It is well for us to remember that a wreath on a coffin never can atone for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed.
   As has happened so often in_the_past , the ability to recognize true greatness has been inadequate and tardy.
     Just a brief note of appreciation to Vice_President Johnson and Pakistani camel driver Bashir_Ahmad for providing a first-class example of  people to people  good_will.
   If only this could be done more_often - with such heartening results - many_of the earth 's  big problems  would shrink to the insignificances they really are.
     P._S..
   Thanks for your good coverage of Ahmad 's visit , too!
     Your continuing editorials concerning the Schuylkill_Expressway are valuable ; however , several pertinent considerations deserve recognition.
     One of the problems associated with the expressway stems from the basic idea.
   We shuffle a large percentage of the cars across the river twice.
   They start on the East_side of the Schuylkill , have to cross over to the West to use the expressway and cross over_again to the East at their destination.
   Bridges , tunnels and ferries are the_most common methods of river crossings.
   Each one of these is , by its nature , a focal_point or a point of natural congestion.
   We should avoid these congestion points or , putting it another way , keep ars starting and ending on the East_side of the river - on the East_side.
     This can be accomplished by several logical steps :     Widen the East_River Drive at least one lane.
     So widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage problems.
     Paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead directional lights as on our bridges.
   One additional lane would then be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the traffic carrying_capability of the East_River_Drive by fifty_percent.
     This could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures necessitated by the Schuylkill_Expressway and without destroying the natural beauty of the East_River_Drive.
     I wish to advocate two drastic changes in Washington_Square :     Take_away George_Washington 's statue.
     Replace it with the statue of one or another of the world 's famous dictators.
     There 's no sense in being reminded of times that were.
   Washington_Square seems not part of a free land.
   It may remind one of Russia , China or East_Berlin ; but it can n't remind one of the freedom that Washington and the Continental soldiers fought for.
     The Fairmount_Park_Commission will no_doubt approve my two proposals , because it is responsible_for the change of ideological atmosphere in the Square.
   The_matter may seem a small thing to some people , I know , but it 's a very good start on_the_road to Totalitarianism.
   The Commission has posted signs in Washington_Square saying :     The Feeding of Birds is Prohibited in_This Square.
     Fairmount_Park_Commission Does each tentacle of the octopus of City_Government reach_out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers an annoyance?
   If birds do n't belong in a Square or Park , what does?
   They are the_most beautiful part of_that little piece of Nature.
   The trees are their homes ; but the Commission does not share such sentiments.
     The whole official City apparently has an intense hatred toward birds.
   Starlings and blackbirds are scared_off by cannon , from City_Hall.
   Just a preliminary measure.
   If any are left , presently , we may expect to see signs specifically prohibiting the feeding of them too.
     The City_Government is not united in an all-out , to-the-death drive to stamp_out gangs , delinquents , thugs , murderers , rapists , subversives.
   Indeed no.
   Let every policeman and park guard keep his eye on John and Jane_Doe , lest one piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive.
     Of_course , in_this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and innocent and dependent creatures die because we 're afraid to feed them and afraid to protest and say  How_come?
   What 's your motive?
   Who wants this deed done ?
   - in_this small way do the leaders of a city , or of a nation , inure the masses to watching , or even inflicting , torture and death , upon even their fellow men.
     One means to help the_birds occurs to me : Let the chimes that ring over Washington_Square twice daily , discontinue any piece_of_music but one.
   Let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody has been the joy of mankind since time began , the hymn  Abide With Me .
   We will know , and He will know , to whom it is rendered , what the_birds would ask.
     There is a trend today to bemoan the fact that Americans are too  soft .
   Unfortunately , those who would remedy our  softness  seek to do so with calisthenics.
   They are working_on the wrong part of our anatomy.
   It is not our bodies but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft.
   Ashamed of our wealth and power , afraid_of so-called world opinion and addicted to peace , we have allowed our soft-heartedness to lead to soft-headed policies.
     When we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which we know to be right , when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations which do not permit self-determination , when we become strong enough to resist any_more drifts towards socialism in our own Nation , when we recognize that our enemy is Communism not war , and when we realize that concessions to Communists do not insure peace or freedom , then , and only then will we no_longer be  soft .
   America does n't need to  push-up  , she needs to stand_up!
     The new column by Maurice_Stans regarding business scandals , is fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has some merit.
   However , he states unequivocally  the scandals in business are far less significant than the scandals in_labor .
   I must , in fairness , take_issue with his premise , primarily because the so-called scandals in_labor unions were very_much connected with business scandals.
     The area most prominently commented on during the McClellan hearings had to do with  sweetheart contracts .
   These arrangements would have been impossible if the business_community was truly interested in the welfare of its employes.
   A sweetheart arrangement can come_about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous labor_leaders demanding tribute.
   Anyone familiar_with the details of the McClellan hearings must at_once realize that the sweetheart arrangements augmented employer profits far more_than they augmented the earnings of the corruptible labor_leaders.
     Further , it should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by Congress to combat corruption in the labor_movement by its passage of the Landrum-Griffin_Act.
    
    All false gods resemble Moloch , at_least in the early phases of their careers , so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol-worship to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice.
   But there is reason in_all things , and in_this country the heathenish cult of the motor-car is exceeding all bounds in its demands.
   The annual butchery of 40000 American men , women and children to satiate its blood-lust is excessive ; a quota of 25000 a year would be more_than sufficient.
     No other popular idol is accorded even that_much grace.
   If the railroads , for_example , regularly slaughtered 25000 passengers each_year , the high_priests of the cult would have cause to tremble for their personal safety , for such a holocaust would excite demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the United_States.
   But by comparison with the railroad , the motor car is a relatively new object of popular worship , so it is too_much to hope that it may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily.
     Yet it is plainly time to make a start , and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic , without being fanatical.
   Here , then , is what Swift would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning.
   From next New_Year 's Day let us keep careful account of each successive fatality on the highways , publicizing it on all media of communication.
   To avoid suspicion of bigotry , let the hand of vengeance be stayed until the meat-wagon has picked_up the twenty-five thousandth corpse ; but let the twenty-five thousand and first butchery be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state_highway commissioners.
     Then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass execution on July 4 , 1963.
   The scene , of_course , should be nine miles northwest of Centralia , Illinois , the geographical center of population according_to the census.
   A special grandstand , protected by awnings from the midsummer sun of Illinois , should be erected for occupancy by honored guests , who should include the ambassadors of all those new African_nations as_yet not_quite convinced that the United_States is thoroughly civilized.
   The band should play the Rogues ' March as a processional , switching to  Hail_Columbia , Happy_Land !
 as the trap is sprung.
     Independence_Day is the appropriate date as a symbolical reminder of the American article of faith that governments are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable rights , the first of_which is life , and when any government becomes subversive of_that end , it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it.
   The highway_system is an agency of government , and when it grinds up 40000 Americans every_year the government is destroying its own taxpayers , which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do.
     Hanging the responsible officials would not abolish the government , but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual citizens , which would certainly alter it , and definitely for the better.
   Moreover , the salubrious effects would not be exclusively political , but at_least partially , and perhaps primarily social.
   It would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some of its ancillary beliefs and practices - for_instance , the doctrine that the fulfillment of life consists_in proceeding from hither to yon , not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of stasis , or , as_it_is generally termed , staying_put.
     True , the adherents of staying_put are now reduced to a minor , even a miniscule sect , and their credo ,  Home-keeping hearts are happiest  , is as disreputable as Socinianism.
   Nonetheless , although few in number they are a stubborn crew , as tenacious of life as the Hardshell Baptists , which suggests that there is some kind_of vital_principle embodied in their faith.
   Perhaps there is more truth than we are wont_to admit in the conviction of_that ornament of Tarheelia , Robert_Ruark 's grandfather , who was persuaded that the great curse of the modern_world is  all this gallivantin  '.
     In_any_event , the yearly sacrifice of 40000 victims is a hecatomb too large to be justified by the_most ardent faith.
   Somehow our contemporary Moloch must be induced to see reason.
   Since appeals to morality , to humanity , and to sanity have had such small effect , perhaps our last recourse is the deterrent_example.
   If we make it established custom that whenever butchery on the highways grows excessive , say beyond 25000 per_annum , then somebody is going_to hang , it follows that the more eminent the victim , the more impressive the lesson.
   To hang 50 Governors might be preferable except that they are not directly related_to the highways ; so , all things considered , the highway commissioners would seem to be elected.
   As the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth , the Soviet_Union stands guilty of a monstrous crime against the human_race.
   But the guilt is shared by the United_States , Britain and France , the other members of the atomic club.
   Until Moscow resumed nuclear testing last September 1 , the US and UK had released more_than twice_as much radiation into the atmosphere as the Russians , and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still coming_down.
   As it descends , the concentration of radioactivity builds_up in the human_body ; for a dose of radiation is not like a flu virus which causes temporary discomfort and_then dies.
   The effect of radiation is cumulative over the years - and on to succeeding generations.
   So , while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning , history is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the West were so quick to assume when Mr._Khrushchev made his cynical and irresponsible threat.
   Shock , dismay and foreboding for future generations were legitimate reactions ; a holier-than-thou sermon was not.
     On October 19 , after the Soviets had detonated at_least 20 nuclear devices , Ambassador_Stevenson warned the UN General_Assembly that this country , in  self protection  , might have to resume above-ground tests.
   More recently , the chairman of the Atomic_Energy Commission , Dr._Glenn_T._Seaborg ,  admitted  to a news_conference in Las_Vegas , Nevada , that the US might fall_behind Russia ( he apparently meant in weapons development ) if the Soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain.
   The trial_balloons are afloat.
     All_of which makes it more imperative than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood.
   But for the average citizen , unfortunately , this is one of science 's worst-marked channels , full_of tricky currents and unknown depths.
   The scientists , in and out of government , do not agree on some of the_most vital points , at_least publicly.
   On_the_one_hand , the Public_Health_Service declared as recently as October 26 that present radiation levels resulting from the Soviet shots  do not warrant undue public concern  or any action to limit the intake of radioactive substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the US.
   But the PHS conceded that the new radioactive particles  will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations , and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the United_States .
   Then it added :  It is not possible to determine how extensive these ill effects will be - nor how many people will be affected .
     Having hedged its bets in_this_way , PHS apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort_of determination after_all :  At_present radiation levels , and even at somewhat higher levels , the additional risk is slight and very_few people will be affected .
   Then , to conclude on an indeterminate note :  Nevertheless , if fallout increased substantially , or remained high for a long_time , it would become far more important as a potential health hazard in_this country and throughout_the_world .
     Dr._Linus_Pauling , a Nobel_Prize winner in chemistry , has been less ambiguous , whether you choose to agree with him or not.
   After declaring , in an article last month in Frontier magazine , that the Russian testing  carries with_it the possibility of the_most tragic consequences of any action in the history of the world  , he gave this estimate of the biologic and genetic consequences if the new Soviet shots totaled 200 megatons :     The damage to human germ_plasm would be such_that in the next few generations 160000 children around the world would be_born with gross physical or mental defects.
   Long-lived carbon-14 from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic , neonatal or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations , and between 200000 and one million human_beings now living would have their lives cut_short by radiation-produced diseases such_as leukemia.
   Most_of these would be in the Northern_Hemisphere , where the fallout is concentrating.
   Pauling 's estimate of 200 megatons yield from the present series of Russian tests will probably turn_out to be too high , but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct possibility.
     The lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is_due in_part to insufficient data covering large population groups , from which agreed-on generalizations could be drawn.
   But more_than one conscientious researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout has been made a political issue as_well as a scientific problem.
   Its dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing.
   An illustration of_this attitude is found in John_A._McCone 's letter to Dr._Thomas_Lauritsen , reported in a note elsewhere in_this issue of The New_Republic.
     To this day the Atomic_Energy Commission shies_away_from discussing the health aspects of fallout.
   A recent study on radiation exposure by the AEC 's division of biology and medicine stated :  The question of the biological effect of [ radiation ] doses is not considered  herein.
   Of_course , the AEC is in a bind now.
   If it comes_down too hard on the potential dangers of fallout , it will box the President on resuming atmospheric tests.
   So the Commission 's announcements of the new Soviet shots have been confined to one or two bleak sentences , with the fission yield usually left vague.
     Now , of_course , that the Russians are the nuclear villains , radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid-1950s , when the US was testing in the atmosphere.
   The prevailing official attitude then seemed to be that fallout , if_not exactly good_for_you , might not be much worse than a bad cold.
   After a nuclear blast , one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days , about all you had to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof.
   Things are n't that simple anymore.
   Yet if Washington gets too indignant about Soviet fallout , it will have to do a_lot_of fast footwork if America decides it too must start pushing_up the radiation count.
     As of October 25 , the AEC had reported 24 shots in the new Soviet series , 12 of them in a megaton range , including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons ( the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million tons of TNT ) ; and President_Kennedy indicated there were one or two more_than those reported.
     Assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one_shot estimated by the Japanese at 10 megatons , a conservative computation is that the 24 announced tests produced a total yield of at_least 60 megatons.
   Some government scientists say privately that the figure probably is closer to 80 megatons , and that the full 50 - megaton_bomb that Khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated.
     If the new Soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous Russian tests , the shots were roughly half fission and half fusion , meaning a fission yield of 30 to 40 megatons thus_far.
   To this must be added the 90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produced between the dawn of the atomic age in 1945 and the informal three-power test moratorium that began in November , 1958.
    
    One of the inescapable realities of the Cold_War is that_is has thrust upon the West a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas.
   The first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself.
   That dilemma is as much with us as ever.
   The second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear testing , a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of Soviet tests.
     When this second dilemma first became obvious - during the mid to late ' 50 's - the United_States appeared to have three choices.
   It could have unilaterally abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations.
   It could have continued testing to_the_full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less_than the danger of Communist world domination.
   Or it could have chosen to find - by negotiation - some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security.
   This third choice was in_fact made.
     With the resumption of Soviet testing and their intransigence at the Geneva talks , however , the hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken.
   Once_again , the United_States must choose.
   And once_again , the choices are much the same.
   Only this time around the conditions are different and the choice is far harder.
     The first choice , abandoning tests entirely , would not_only be unpopular domestically , but would surely be exploited by the Russians.
   The second choice , full testing , has become even more risky just because the current Soviet tests have already dangerously contaminated the atmosphere.
   The third choice , negotiation , presupposes , as Russian behavior demonstrates , a great_deal of wishful_thinking to make it appear reasonable.
     We take the position , however , that the third choice still remains the only sane one open_to us.
   It is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable.
   Its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice ; one which , should it fail , will not have contaminated the conscience.
   That is the contamination we most fear.
     LEAVING ASIDE the choice of unilateral cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral , the question must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part would not be a good choice.
   For that is the one an increasingly large_number of prominent Americans are now proposing.
   In_particular , Governor_Nelson_Rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests.
     Speaking recently in Miami , Governor_Rockefeller said that  to assure the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent Soviet tests , we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests .
   Taking_account of the fact that such a move on our part would be unpopular in world opinion , he argued that the responsibility of the United_States is  to do , confidently and firmly , not what is popular , but what is right .
     What was missing in the Governor 's argument , as in so many similar arguments , was a premise which would enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable to what is right.
   The possibility , as he asserted , that the Russians may get_ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests does not supply the needed ethical premise - unless , of_course , we have unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken as a moral demand.
     Besides the lack of an adequate ethical dimension to the Governor 's case , one can ask seriously whether our lead over the Russians in quality and quantity of nuclear_weapons is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary.
   Recent statements by the President and Defense_Department spokesmen have , to_the_contrary , assured us that our lead is very great.
   Unless the Administration and the Defense_Department have been deceiving us , the facts do not support the assertion that we are  compelled  to resume atmospheric testing.
     It is perfectly conceivable that a resumption of atmospheric tests may , at some point in_the_future , be necessary and even justifiable.
   But a resumption does not seem justifiable now.
   What we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination of the atmosphere by the Soviet tests has radically increased our own moral_obligations.
   We now have to think not_only of our national security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests we might undertake.
   This is an ethical demand which cannot be evaded or glossed_over by talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even of the evil of Communism.
     Too often in_the_past Russian tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part.
   There ought_to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless_of what Russia does.
   The refusal to resume atmospheric testing would be a good start.
     When his Holiness Pope_John 23 , first called_for an Ecumenical_Council , and at_the_same_time voiced his yearning for Christian unity , the enthusiasm among Catholic and Protestant ecumenicists was immediate.
   With good reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided Christendom.
   But as the more concrete plans for the work of the Council gradually became known , there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on_all_sides.
   The Council we now know will concern itself directly only with the internal affairs of the Church.
     As it has turned_out , however , the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of hope in the second were both wrong responses.
   Two things have happened in recent months to bring the Council into perspective :   each provides a basis for renewed hope and joy.
     First_of_all , it is now known that Pope_John sees the renewal and purification of the Church as an absolutely necessary step toward Christian unity.
   Far from being irrelevant to the ecumenical task , the Pontiff believes that a revivified Church is required in_order that the whole world may see Catholicism in the best possible light.
   Equally significant , Pope_John has said that Catholics themselves bear some responsibility for Christian disunity.
   A major aim of the Council will be to remove as_far_as_possible whatever in the Church today stands in the way of unity.
     Secondly , a whole series of addresses and actions by the Pope and by others show that concern for Christian unity is still very_much alive and growing within the Church.
   The establishment , by the Holy_Father , of a permanent Secretariat for Christian_Unity in 1960 was the_most dramatic mark of_this concern.
   The designation of five Catholic theologians to attend the World_Council of Churches assembly in New_Delhi as  official  observers reverses the Church 's earlier stand.
   The public appeal by the new Vatican Secretary_of_State , Cardinal_Cicognani , for renewed efforts toward Eastern and Western reunion was still another remarkable act.
   Nor can one forget Pope_John 's unprecedented meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury.
     Augustin_Cardinal_Bea , the director of the Secretariate for Christian_Unity , has expressed as directly as anyone the new spirit that pervades the Church 's stance toward the Protestant and Orthodox_Churches.
   Noting all the difficulties that stand in the way of reunion , he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone.
   For discouragement , or the temptation to abandon our efforts ,  would show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without thinking of the omnipotence of God , the irresistible efficacy of prayer , the action of Christ or the power of the Divine_Spirit .
   Can any Christian fail to respond to these words?
     The administration 's official budget review , which estimates a 6.9 billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal_year , is n't making anyone happy.
   Certainly it is n't making the President happy , and he has been doing his apologetic best to explain how the budget got into its unbalanced condition , how he intends to economize wherever he can and_how he hopes to do better next year.
     We sympathize with Mr._Kennedy , but we feel bound to say that his budget review does n't please us either , although for very different reasons.
   Furthermore , we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying than reassuring.
     In_the_first_place , a large part of the discrepancy between President_Eisenhower 's estimate of a 1.5 billion dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost seven billion dollar deficit is the result of the outgoing President 's farewell gift of a political booby-trap to his successor.
   The Eisenhower budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received.
     The rest of the deficit is also easily understood.
   Four billion dollars of the spending increase is for defense , an expenditure necessitated by the penny-wise policies of the Eisenhhower_Administration , quite apart from the recent crises in Berlin and elsewhere.
   Four_hundred million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program , a responsibility similarly neglected by Mr._Eisenhower.
   The farm program will cost an additional 1.5 billion , because of unusual weather factors , the Food for Peace program and other new measures.
   Anti-recession programs - aid for the unemployed , their children and for depressed areas - account_for only 900 million of the 6.9 billion dollar deficit.
     Our complaint is that in many crucial areas the Kennedy programs are not too large but too small , most seriously in regard_to the conventional arms build-up and in aid and welfare measures.
   And yet Mr._Kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents of the right with apologies and promises of  tightening_up  and  economizing .
   We wish the President would remember that  fiscal responsibility  was the battle-cry of the party that lost the election.
   The party that won used_to say something about a New_Frontier.
     Introduction of the  dialogue  principle proved strikingly effective at the thirty-fourth annual meeting of the Catholic_Association for International_Peace in Washington the last weekend in October.
   Two of the principal addresses were delivered by prominent Protestants , and when the speaker was a Catholic , one  discussant  on the dais tended_to be of another religious persuasion.
     Several effects were immediately evident.
   Sessions devoted_to  Ethics and Foreign_Policy Trends  ,  Moral_Principle and Political Judgment  ,  Christian_Ethics in the Cold_War  and related subjects proved to be much livelier under this procedure than if Catholics were merely talking to themselves.
   Usually questions from the floor were directed to the non-Catholic speaker or discussion leader.
     In the earlier sessions there was plentiful discussion on the natural_law , which Dr._William_V._O ' Brien of Georgetown_University , advanced as the basis for widely acceptable ethical judgments on foreign_policy.
   That Aristotelean-Thomistic principle experienced a thorough going-over from a_number_of the participants , but in_the_end the concept came to reassert itself.
   Speakers declared that Protestants often make use of it , if , perhaps , by some other name.
   A Lebanese Moslem told about its existence and application in the Islamic tradition as the  divine law  , while a C._A._I._P. member who has been working in close association with delegates of the new U._N. nations told of its widespread recognition on the African continent.
   The impression was unmistakable that , whatever one may choose to call it , natural_law is a functioning generality with a certain objective existence.
     Another question that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself.
   The stimulus from the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences was undeniable.
   It was expected that the comparison of different approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each other 's positions and better comprehension of one 's own.
   But a realization that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed , and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political issues.
     One effect of the spirited give-and-take of these discussions was to focus attention on practical_applications and the necessity of being armed with the facts : knowledge of the destructive force of even the tiniest  tactical  atomic weapon would have a bearing on judgments as to the advisability of its use - to defend Berlin , for_example ; the pervasive influence of ideology on our political judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account ; it is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the Christian imperative.
    
    Everywhere I went in Formosa I asked the same question.
   I was searching for an accent of self-delusion or , even , of hypocrisy.
   I never found it among any of the Chinese with whom I spoke , though granted they were , almost all , members of the official family who , presumably , harbor official thoughts.
   But I questioned , also , professional soldiers , who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarian 's dreamy irredentism.
   Their answer was : it can be done , and we will do it.
   And_then I put the question as pointedly as I could directly to Chiang_Kai-shek :  In America  , I said ,  practically no one believes that you subjectively intend to re-enter the Mainland.
   What evidence is there of an objective kind that in_fact your government proposes to do just that , and that it can be done ?
     He smiled.
   ( He always smiles - at_least at visitors , I gather.
   He smiled also at a British bloke seated next to me , who asked the_most asinine questions.
   I recalled sympathetically the Duke 's complaint in Browning 's  My Last Duchess .
   He smiled , and said a word or two to the interpreter , who turned_to me ,  The President wonders where you are going after you leave Taipei ?
   That , I smarted , is a royal rebuff if ever there was one.
     I answered the routine question about my itinerary , rather coolly.
   Chiang spoke again , this time at greater length.
    The President says  , the translator came_in ,  that the reason he asked you where you were going is because he hoped you would be visiting other areas in Southeast_Asia , and that everywhere you went , you would seek the answer to your question.
   He says that if he were to express to you , once_again , his own profound determination to go to the Mainland , and his faith that that return is feasible , he would merely sound redundant.
   So you yourself must seek these objective data , and come to your own conclusions.
   Any information we have here in Taiwan is at your disposal .
     Fair enough.
   What are the relevant data?
   For every person on Taiwan , there are sixty in Mainland_China.
   If the raw population figures are crucially relevant , then it is idle to think_of liberation , as idle as to suppose that Poland might liberate Russia.
   Relative military manpower?
   Less_than 60 - 1 , but at_least 6 - 1.
   The estimates vary widely on the strength of the Chinese army.
   Say four million.
   The armed_forces of Taiwan are at a working strength of about 450000 , though a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated.
   Skill?
   Training?
   Morale?
   It is generally conceded that the Formosan air_force is the best by_far in Asia , and the army the best trained.
   The morale is very high.
     Even_so , it adds_up to impossible odds , except that the question arises , On whose side would the Mainland Chinese army fight?
     The miserable people of China , the largest cast ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion_play , cannot themselves resist overtly.
   They think , perforce , of physical survival : everything else is secondary.
   But the army which Mao continues to feed well , where are its sympathies?
   The psychological strategists in Taiwan stress the great sense of family , cultivated in China over thousands of years.
   It has not been extirpated by ten years of Communist depersonalization.
   Every soldier in the army has , somewhere , relatives who are close_to starvation.
   The soldiers themselves cannot stage a successful rebellion , it is assumed : but will their discontent spread to the officer class?
   The immediate families of the generals and the admirals are well_fed : a despot does not economize on his generals.
   But there are the cousins and aunts and nephews.
   Their privations are almost beyond endurance.
   In behalf of_what?
   Leninism-Marxism , as understood by Exegete_Mao.
   To whom will the generals stay loyal?
   There is little doubt if they had a secret ballot , they would vote for food for their family , in_place of ideological purity out on the farm.
   It is another question whether  they  - or a single general , off in a corner of China , secure for a_few ( galvanizing?
 )   days at_least from instant retaliation - will defy the Party.
   But the disposition to rebel is most definitely there.
     But there must be a catalytic pressure.
   The military in Taiwan believe that the Communists have made two mistakes , which , together , may prove fatal.
   The first was the commune program , which will ensure agricultural poverty for years.
   The family is largely broken_up ; and where it is not , it is left with no residue , and the social meaning of_this is enormous.
   For it is the family that , in China , has always provided social_security for the indigent , the sick , the down-and-out members of the clan.
   Now the government must do that ; but the government is left with no reserve granary , under the agricultural system it has ordained.
   Thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social_security which had traditionally been privately discharged , and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social_security.
     The second mistake is Tibet.
   Tibet has historically served China as a buffer_state.
   A friendly state , sometimes only semi-independent , but never hostile.
   China never tried to integrate Tibet by extirpating the people 's religion and institutions.
   Red_China is trying to do this , and she is not likely ever to succeed.
   Tibet is too vast , the terrain is too difficult.
   Tibet may bleed China as Algeria is bleeding France.
     These continuing pressures , social , economic and military , are doing much to keep China in a heightening state of tension.
   The imposition of yet another pressure , a strong one , from_the_outside , might cause it to snap.
     The planners in Taiwan struck me as realistic men.
   They know that they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control.
   First_and_foremost , they depend_on the inhuman idiocies of the Communist regime.
   On these they feel they can rely.
   Secondly , they depend_on America 's  moral cooperation  when the crucial moment arrives.
   They hope that if history vouchsafes the West another Budapest , we will receive the opportunity gladly.
   I remarked jocularly to the President that the future of China would be far more certain if he would invite a planeload of selected American Liberals to Quemoy on an odd day.
   He affected ( most properly ) not to understand my point.
   But he - and all_of China - wear the scars of American indecisiveness , and he knows what an uncertain ally we are.
   We have been grand to Formosa itself - lots_of aid , and , most_of the time , a policy of support for the offshore islands.
   But our outlook has been , and continues to be , defensive.
   A great_deal depends_on the crystallization of Mr._Kennedy 's views on the world struggle.
   The Free Chinese know that the situation on the Mainland is in flux , and are poised to strike.
   There is not_anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized force for liberation.
   The moment of truth is the moment of crisis.
   During the slow buildup , the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under embroidered details , fine words , strutting gestures.
   The crisis burns these suddenly away.
   There the truth is , open_to eyes that are willing to look.
   The moment passes.
   New self-deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the too-naked bones.
     A truth-revealing crisis erupted in Katanga for a_couple_of days this month , to be quickly smothered by the high_pressure verbal fog that_is kept on_tap for such emergencies.
   Before memory , too , clouds_over , let us make a note or two of_what could be seen.
     The measure was instantly taken , as always in such cases , of public men at many levels.
   One knows better , now , who has bone and who has jelly in his spine.
   But I am here concerned more with policy than with men.
   Public men come and go but great issues of policy remain.
     Now , everyone knows - or knew in the week of December 10 - that something had gone shockingly wrong with American foreign_policy.
   The United_States was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful , orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the_most pro-Western and anti-Communist within any of the new nations - the only place in Africa , moreover , where a productive relationship between whites and blacks had apparently been achieved.
   Of_course the fighting was officially under the auspices of the United_Nations.
   But in the moment of truth everyone could see that the U._S. was in_reality the principal.
     The moment simultaneously revealed that in the crisis our policy ran counter to_that of all our NATO allies , to the entire Western community.
   By our policy the West was - is - split.
     But the key revelation is not new.
   The controlling pattern was first displayed in the Hungary-Suez crisis of November 1956.
   It reappears , in whole or part , whenever a new crisis exposes the reality : in Cuba last spring ( with which the Dominican events of last month should be paired ) ; at the peaks of the nuclear test and the Berlin cycles ; in_relation_to Laos , Algeria , South_Africa ; right_now , with almost cartoon emphasis , in the temporally linked complex of Tshombe-Gizenga-Goa-Ghana.
     This prime element of the truth may be stated as_follows :   Under prevailing policy , the U._S. can take the initiative against the Right , but cannot take the initiative against the Left.
   It makes no difference what part of the world is involved , what form of regime , what particular issue.
   The U._S. cannot take the initiative against the Left.
   There is even some question whether the U._S. can any longer defend itself against an initiative by the Left.
     We can attack Tshombe , but not Gigenza.
   No_matter that Gizenga is Moscow 's man in the Congo.
   No_matter that it is his troops who rape Western women and eat Western men.
   No_matter that the Katanga operation is strategically insane in_terms_of Western interests in Africa.
   ( Even granted that the Congo should be unified , you do n't protect Western security by first removing the pro-Western weight from the power equilibrium.
 )     We can force Britain and France out of the Suez , but we cannot so_much as try to force the Russian tanks back from Budapest.
   We can mass our fleet against the Trujillos , but not against the Castros.
   We can vote_in the UN against South_African apartheid or Portuguese rule in Angola , but we cannot even introduce a motion on the Berlin_Wall - much less , give the simple order to push the Wall down.
   We officially receive the anti-French , Moscow-allied Algerian FLN , but we denounce the pro-Europe , anti-Communist OAS as criminal.
     In the very week of our war against Katanga , we make a $ 133 million grant to Kwame_Nkrumah , who has just declared his solidarity with the Communist bloc , and is busily turning his own country into a totalitarian dictatorship.
   As our planes land the war materiel that kills pro-Western Katangans , we stand supinely bleating while Nehru 's troops smash into a five-hundred-year-old district of our NATO ally , Portugal.
     What explains this uni-directional paralysis?
   It is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes the frame of our international - and in some degree our domestic - policy.
   The Suez-Hungary crisis proves that this system was not invented by the new Administration , but only made more consistent and more active.
     Most immediately relevant to these episodes in Goa , Katanga and Ghana , as to the Suez-Hungary crisis before them , is the belief that the main theater of the world drama is the underdeveloped region of Asia , Africa and Latin_America.
   From this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy on the  uncommitted  (  neutralist  ,  contested  ) nations , especially on those whose leaders make the_most noise - Nehru , Tito , Nkrumah , Sukarno , Betancourt , etc..
   Our chief aim becomes that of finding favor in neutralist eyes.
     If we grasp this orientation as a key , our national conduct in_all of the events here mentioned becomes intelligible.
   And it becomes clear why in_general we cannot take the initiative against the Left.
    
    To write a play , the dramatist once needed an idea plus the imagination , the knowledge of life and the craft to develop it.
   Nowadays , more_and_more , all he needs is someone else 's book.
   To get_started , he does not scan the world about him ; he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists.
   So_far this season , Broadway 's premieres have included twice_as many adaptations and imports as original American stage plays.
     Of straight dramas , there are All_the_Way Home , which owes much of its poetic power to the James_Agee novel , A Death in the Family ; The Wall , awkwardly based on the John_Hersey novel ; Advise and Consent , lively but shallow theater drawn from the mountainously detailed bestseller ; Face of a Hero ( closed ) , based on a Pierre_Boulle novel.
   The only original works attempting to reach any stature : Tennessee_Williams ' disappointing domestic comedy , Period of Adjustment , and Arthur_Laurents ' clever but empty Invitation to a March.
   Clearly the_most provocative plays are all imported originals - A Taste_of Honey , by Britain 's young ( 19 when she wrote it ) Shelagh_Delaney ; Becket , by France 's Jean_Anouilh ; The Hostage ( closed ) , by Ireland 's Brendan_Behan.
     Among the musicals , Camelot came from T._H._White 's The Once and Future_King , and novels were the sources of the less_than momentous Tenderloin and Do Re_Mi.
   Wildcat and The Unsinkable_Molly_Brown were originals , but pretty bad , leaving top honors again to an import - the jaunty and charmingly French Irma_La_Douce.
   The only other works at least technically original were dreary farces - Send Me No Flowers ( closed ) , Under the Yum-Yum_Tree , Critic 's Choice.
   In the forthcoming The Conquering_Hero and Carnival , Broadway is not even adapting books , but reconverting old movies ( Hail the Conquering_Hero and Lili ).
     Originals are not necessarily good and adaptations are not necessarily bad.
   Some memorable plays have been drawn from books , notably Life with Father and Diary of Anne_Frank.
   And particularly in the musical field , adaptations have long been the rule , from Die_Fledermaus and The Merry Widow to Oklahoma!
   and My Fair_Lady.
   As Critic_Walter_Kerr points_out :  Adaptations , so_long as they are good , still qualify as creative .
   And other defenders invariably argue that , after_all , Shakespeare and Moliere were adapters too.
   The difference is that the masters took the bare frame of a plot and filled it with their own world ; most modern adapters totally accept the world of a book , squeeze it dry of life , and add only one contribution of their own :   stage technique.
     The_most frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals and tested imports is increasing production expense - producers cannot afford to take_chances.
   But that explanation is only partly true.
   Off-Broadway , where production is still comparatively cheap , is proving itself only slightly more original.
   Laudably enough , it is offering classics and off-beat imports , but last week only one U._S. original was on the boards , Robert_D._Hock 's stunning Civil_War work , Borak.
   The real trouble seems to be the failing imagination of U._S. playwrights.
     He :  Come with me to the casbah .
   She :  By subway or cab ?
     That exchange was not_only possible but commonplace last week in Manhattan , as more_and_more New Yorkers were discovering 29 th Street and Eighth_Avenue , where half_a_dozen small nightclubs with names like Arabian_Nights , Grecian Palace and Egyptian Gardens are the American inpost of belly_dancing.
   Several more will open soon.
   Their burgeoning popularity may be a result of the closing of the 52 nd Street burlesque joints , but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always familial - neighborhood saloons with a_bit of epidermis.
     The belly boites , with their papier-mache palm_trees or hand-painted Ionic columns , heretofore existed mainly on the patronage of Greek and Turkish families.
   Customers often bring their children ; between performances , enthusiastic young_men from the audience will take_the_floor to demonstrate their own amateur graces.
   Except for the odd uptown sex maniac or an overeager Greek sailor , the people watch in calm absorption.
   Small , shirt-sleeved orchestras play in 2 4 or 4 4 time , using guitars , violins , and more alien instruments with names that would open_Sesame : the oud , grandfather of the lute ; the darbuka , a small drum with the treelike shape of a roemer glass ; the def , a low-pitched tambourine.
   The girls sit quietly with the musicians , wearing prim dresses or plain , secretarial shifts , until it is time to go off to a back_room and reappear in the spare uniform of the harem.
     If a dancer is good , she suggests purely and superbly the fundamental mechanics of ancestry and progeny - the continuum of mankind.
   But a great many_of what Variety calls the  cooch terpers  are considerably less cosmic than that.
   Each dancer follows the ancient Oriental pattern - she glides sideways with shoulders motionless while her stomach migrates , and , through breathing and muscle control , she sends ripples across her body to the fingertips and away to the far end of the room.
   This is done at varying speeds , ranging from the slow and fast Shifte_Telli ( a musical term meaning double strings ) to the fastest , ecstatic Karshilama ( meaning greetings or welcome ).
   The New_York dancers are highly eclectic , varying the pattern with all kinds of personal improvisations , back bends or floor crawls.
   But they do not strip.
   The striptease is crass ; the belly_dance leaves more to the imagination.
     When a dancer does well , she provokes a quiet bombardment of dollar_bills - although the Manhattan clubs prohibit the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping the tips into the dancers ' costumes.
   With tips , the girls average between $ 150 and $ 200 a week , depending_on basic salary.
   Although they are forbidden to sit with the customers , the dancers are sometimes proffered drinks , and most_of them can bolt one down in mid-shimmy.
     All_over the country , belly clubs have never been bigger , especially in Detroit , Boston and Chicago , and even in small_towns ; one of the best dancers , a Turkish girl named Semra , works at a roadhouse outside Bristol , Conn..
   The girls are kept booked and moving by several agents , notably voluble , black-bearded Murat_Somay , a Manhattan_Turk who is the Sol_Hurok of the central abdomen.
   He can offer nine Turkish girls , plans to import at_least 15 more.
   But a great many_of the dancers are more_or_less native.
   Sometimes they get their initial experience in church haflis , conducted by Lebanese and Syrians in the U._S. , where they dance with just_as few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs.
     As the girls come to belly_dancing from this and other origins , the melting_pot has never bubbled more intriguingly.
   Some Manhattan examples :     Jemela ( surname : Gerby ) , 23 , seems Hong_Kong Oriental but has a Spanish father and an Indian mother , was_born in America and educated at Holy_Cross_Academy and Textile High_School , says she learned belly_dancing at family picnics.
     Serene ( Mrs._Wilson ) , 23 , was_born in Budapest and raised in Manhattan.
   Daughter of a gypsy mother who taught her to dance , she is one of the few really beautiful girls in the New_York casbah , with dark eyes and dark , waist-length hair , the face of an adolescent patrician and a lithe , glimmering body.
   Many belly_dancers are married , but Serene is one of the few who will admit it.
     Marlene ( surname : Adamo ) , 25 , a Brazilian divorcee who learned the dance from Arabic friends in Paris , now lives on Manhattan 's West_Side , is about the best belly_dancer working the casbah , loves it so_much that she dances on her day_off.
   She has the small , highly_developed body of a prime athlete , and holds in contempt the  girls who just move sex .
     Leila ( Malia_Phillips ) , 25 , is a Greenwich_Village painter of Persianesque miniatures who has red hair that cascades almost to her ankles.
   A graduate of Hollywood High_School , she likes to imagine herself , as she takes_the_floor ,  a village girl coming_in to a festival .
     Gloria ( surname : Ziraldo ) , circa 30 , who was_born in Italy and once did  chorus work  in Toronto , has been around longer than most_of the others , wistfully remembers the old days when  we used_to get the seamen from the ships , you know , with big turtleneck sweaters and handkerchiefs and all.
   But the ships are very slow now , and we do n't get so many sailors any_more .
   The uptown crowd has moved_in , and what girl worth her seventh veil would trade a turtleneck sweater for a button-down collar?
     Of the handful of painters that Austria has produced in the 20 th century , only one , Oskar_Kokoschka , is widely known in the U._S..
   This state of unawareness may not last much longer.
   For ten years a small group of European and U._S. critics has been calling_attention_to the half-forgotten Austrian expressionist Egon_Schiele , who died 42 years ago at the age of 28.
   The critics ' campaign finally inspired the first major U._S. exhibit of Schiele 's works.
   The show has been to Boston and Manhattan , will in_time reach Pittsburgh and Minneapolis.
   Last week it opened at the J._B. Speed Museum in Louisville , at the very moment that a second Schiele exhibit was being made ready at the Felix_Landau gallery in Los_Angeles.
     Schiele 's paintings are anything but pleasant.
   His people ( see color ) are angular and knobby-knuckled , sometimes painfully stretched , sometimes grotesquely foreshortened.
   His colors are dark and murky , and his landscapes and cityscapes seem swallowed in gloom.
   But he painted some of the boldest and most original pictures of his time , and even after nearly half a century , the tense , tormented world he put on canvas has lost none of its fascination.
     The son of a railway stationmaster , Schiele lived most_of his childhood in the drowsy Danubian town of Tulln , 14 miles northwest of Vienna.
   He was an emotional , lonely boy who spent so_much time turning_out drawings that he did scarcely_any schoolwork.
   When he was 15 , his parents finally allowed him to attend classes at the Academy of Fine_Arts in Vienna.
   Even there he did not last for long.
   Cried one professor after a_few months of Student_Schiele 's tantrums and rebellion :    The_devil himself must have defecated you into my classroom !
     For_a_while his work was influenced deeply by the_French impressionists , and by the patterned , mosaic-like paintings of Gustav_Klimt , then the dean of Austrian art.
   Gradually Schiele evolved a somber style of his own - and he had few inhibitions about his subject_matter.
   His pictures were roundly denounced as  the_most disgusting things one has ever seen in Vienna .
   He himself was once convicted of painting erotica and jailed for 24 days - the first three of_which he spent desperately trying to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle.
   For years he wore hand-me-down suits and homemade paper collars , was even driven to scrounging for cigarette_butts in Vienna 's gutters.
   Drafted into the Austrian army , he rebelliously rejected discipline , wangled a Vienna billet , went_on painting.
   It was not until the last year of his life that he had his first moneymaking show.
     The unabashed sexuality of so many_of this paintings was not the only thing that kept the public at_bay :   his view of the world was one of almost unrelieved tragedy , and it was too_much even for morbid-minded Vienna.
   He was obsessed by disease and poverty , by the melancholy of old_age and the tyranny of lust.
   The children he painted were almost always in rags , his portraits were often ruthless to_the_point of ugliness , and his nudes - including several self-portraits - were stringy , contorted and strangely pathetic.
   The subject he liked most was the female_body , which he painted in every state - naked , half-dressed , muffled to the ears , sitting primly in a chair , lying tauntingly on a bed or locked in an embrace.
    
    The_most surprising thing about the Twenty-second_Congress of the Soviet Communist_Party is that it was surprising - perhaps quite as much , in its own way , as the Twentieth_Congress of 1956 , which ended with_that famous  secret  report on Stalin.
   The publication last July of the party 's Draft Program - that blueprint for the  transition to communism  - had led the uninitiated to suppose that this Twenty-second_Congress would be a sort_of apotheosis of the Khrushchev regime , a solemn consecration of ideas which had , in_fact , been current over the last three or four years ( i. e. , since the defeat of the  anti-party group  ) in_all theoretical party journals.
   These never ceased to suggest that if , in the eyes of Marx and Lenin  full communism  was still a very distant ideal , the establishment of a Communist society had now , under Khrushchev , become an  immediate and tangible reality .
   It seems that Khrushchev himself took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking contribution to Marxist doctrine with his Draft Program ( a large part of his twelve-hour speech at the recent Congress was , in_fact , very largely a rehash of_that interminable document ).
   He and other Soviet leaders responsible_for the document were proud of having brought_forward some new formulas , such_as the early replacement of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an  All People 's State  , and also of having laid_down the lines for a much greater  democratization  of the whole hierarchy of Soviets , starting with the Supreme Soviet itself.
   Their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary blow at  bureaucracy  and would enable  the people  to take a more direct and active part in running the country.
   Also , elections would be more democratic ; there might even be two or more candidates for voters to choose from.
     No_doubt , there was still a_lot in the Draft Program - and in Khrushchev 's speech - which left many points obscure.
   Was it the party 's intention , for_example , to abolish gradually the kolkhoz system and replace it by uniformly wage-earning sovkhozes , i. e. , state farms ( which were , moreover , to be progressively  urbanized  )?
   As we know , the Soviet peasant today still very largely thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on his private plot ; and it is still very far from certain how valid the party 's claim is that in  a growing number of kolkhozes  the peasants are finding it more profitable , to surrender their private plots to the kolkhoz and to let the latter be turned_into something increasingly like a state farm.
   If one follows the reports of the Congress , one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this matter.
     The Draft Program was interesting in_other_respects , too.
   It contained , for_example , a_number_of curious admissions about the peasants , who enjoy no sickness_benefits , no old-age pensions , no paid holidays ; they still benefit far less_than the  other  50 per_cent of the nation from_that  welfare_state  which the Soviet_Union so greatly prides itself on being.
     Over all these fairly awkward problems Khrushchev was to skate rather lightly ; and , though he repeated , over_and_over_again , the spectacular figures of industrial and agricultural production in 1980 , the  ordinary  people in Russia are still a_little uncertain as to how  communism  is really going to work in_practice , especially in respect of food.
   Would agriculture progress as rapidly as industry?
   This was something on_which K. himself seemed to have some doubts ; for he kept_on threatening that he would  pull the ears  of those responsible_for agricultural production.
   And , as we know , the_Virgin Lands are not producing as much_as Khrushchev had hoped.
     One cannot but wonder whether these doubts about the success of Khrushchev 's agricultural policy have not at_least something to do with one of the big surprises provided by this Congress - the obsessive harping on the crimes and misdeeds of the  anti-party group  - Molotov , Malenkov , Kaganovich and_others - including the eighty-year-old Marshal_Voroshilov.
   Molotov , in_particular , is being charged with all kinds of sins - especially with wanting to cut_down free public_services , to increase rents and fares ; in_fact , with having been against all the more popular features of the Khrushchev  welfare_state .
   The trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels is that we hear only one side of the story :   what , in the secret councils of the Kremlin , Molotov had really proposed , we just do n't know , and he has had no chance to reply.
     But one cannot escape the suspicion that all this non-stop harping_on the misdeeds of the long liquidated  anti-party  group would be totally unnecessary if there were not , inside the party , some secret but genuine opposition to Khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds , on the actual methods to be employed in the  transition to communism  and , last_but_not_least , on foreign_policy.
     The whole problem of  peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition  with the capitalist world is in the very center of_this Congress.
   Mikoyan declared :      Molotov altogether rejects the line of peaceful coexistence , reducing this concept merely to the state of peace or rather , the absence of war at a given moment , and to a denial of the possibility of averting a world_war.
   His views , in_fact , coincide with those of foreign enemies of peaceful coexistence , who look_upon it merely as a variant of the  cold_war  or of an  armed peace  .
     One cannot help wondering whether Molotov and the rest of the  anti-party group  are not being used as China 's whipping-boys by Khrushchev and his faithful followers.
   For something , clearly , has gone very , very seriously wrong in Soviet-Chinese relations , which were never easy , and have now deteriorated.
     The effect of Chou_En-lai 's clash with Khrushchev , together with the everlasting attacks on Molotov + Co. , has shifted the whole attention of the world , including that of the Soviet people , from the  epoch-making  twenty-year program to the present Soviet-Chinese conflict.
   Not_only , as we know , did Chou_En-lai publicly treat Khrushchev 's attack on Albania as  something that we cannot consider as a serious Marxist-Leninist approach  to the problem ( i. e. , as something thoroughly dictatorial and  undemocratic  ) , but the Albanian leaders went out of their way to be openly abusive to Khrushchev , calling him a liar , a bully , and_so_on.
   It is extremely doubtful that the handful of Albanians who call themselves Communists could have done this without the direct approval of their Chinese friends.
   The big question is whether , in the name of a restored Chinese-Soviet solidarity , the Chinese will choose to persuade the Albanians to present their humble apologies to Khrushchev - or get_rid_of Enver_Hoxa.
   These seem about the only two ways in_which the  unhappy incident  can now be closed.
     But Albania is merely a symptom of a real malaise between China and Russia.
   There are other symptoms.
   Khrushchev , for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable decay of capitalism , is genuinely favorable to  peaceful coexistence  and would like , above_all , the Berlin and German problems to be settled peacefully ; he knows that he was never more popular than at_the_time of the Russo-American  honeymoon  of 1959.
   But it seems that pressures against him are coming from somewhere - in_the_first_place from China , but perhaps also from_that  China_Lobby  which , I was assured in Moscow nearly two years ago , exists on_the_quiet inside the party.
   To these people , solidarity and unity with China should be the real basis of Russia 's future policy.
   And the Chinese , as the Albanian incident shows , have strong suspicions that Khrushchev is anxious to secure a  shameful  peace with the West.
   The fact that China ( which is obsessed by Formosa - to Khrushchev a very small matter ) should be supported by North_Korea and North_Vietnam is highly indicative.
   And one cannot but wonder whether Marshal_Malinovsky , who was blowing hot and cold , exalting peace but also almost openly considering the possibility of preventive war against the West , was n't trying to keep the Chinese quiet.
   And this brings us inevitably to the 30 - or 50 - megaton_bomb.
   Was not this dropped primarily in_order_to  appease  the Chinese - especially after  Khrushchev 's  humiliating  surrender to the West in canceling the German peace-treaty deadline of December 31?
     What does it all add_up to?
   Indications are that Khrushchev ( and , with him , the bulk of the Soviet people ) favor peaceful coexistence and ( with the exception of Berlin ) the maintenance of the status_quo in the world.
   The Chinese , North Vietnamese and North Koreans , on_the_other_hand , feel that , militarily , Russia is strong enough to support them in the  just wars of liberation  they would like to embark_on before_long :   with China attacking Formosa and the North Koreans and North Vietnamese liberating the southern half of their respective countries.
     Perhaps Khrushchev is in a more difficult position than any since 1957 , when the  anti-party group  nearly liquidated him.
   He seems strong enough inside the party to cope_with any internal opposition ; but if he is up against China 's crusading spirit in world affairs , he is going_to be faced with the_most agonizing choice in his life.
   He may support China ( but he won n't ) ; he may break_with China ( which would be infernally difficult and perhaps disastrous ) , or he may succeed , by all kinds of dangerous concessions , in persuading China to be patient.
   The next days may show where things stand.
   On a misty Sunday morning last month , a small band of militant anti-Communists called the Minutemen held maneuvers in a foggy field about fifteen miles east of here.
   Eleven men , a woman and a teen-age boy tramped over cold , damp , fog-enshrouded ground during a two-hour field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare.
     To the average American , this must sound like an incredible tale from a Saturday night TV movie.
   But to the Minutemen , this is a serious business.
   They feel that the United_States is engaged in a life-and-death struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy.
   They feel that World_War 3 , has already begun , and they are setting themselves up as a  last line_of_defense  against the Communist advance.
     Their national_leader , Robert_Bolivar_DePugh of Norborne , Mo. , says the Minutemen believe that guerrilla tactics are best suited to defeat the Red onslaught.
   In their maneuvers last month , they wore World_War 2 , camouflage garb and helmets , and carried unloaded M-1_rifles.
     The maneuvers were held  in_secret  after a regional seminar for the Minutemen , held in nearby Shiloh , Ill. , had been broken_up the previous day by deputy_sheriffs , who had arrested regional leader Richard_Lauchli of Collinsville , Ill. , and seized four operative weapons , including a Browning machine_gun , two Browning automatic_rifles and an M-4 rifle.
     Undismayed by this contretemps , a small band of the faithful gathered at Lauchli 's home at 6 : 30 A._M. the next day , put_on their uniforms , and headed for a farm several miles away.
   A 60 mm. mortar and a 57 mm. recoilless rifle owned by Lauchli were brought along.
   The mortar was equipped with dummy shells and the recoilless rifle was deactivated.
     After a tortuous drive in an open truck and a World_War 2 , army jeep down soggy trails , the band arrived_at a small clearing squeezed between a long , low ridge and a creek-filled gully.
   Here the two leaders , DePugh and Lauchli , hastened to put the group through its paces.
     The Minutemen were instructed in the use of terrain for concealment.
   They were shown how to advance against an enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge.
   They practiced movement behind a smoke_screen laid by smoke_grenades ; and they attempted a skirmish line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment.
   Eleven dummy rounds were fired by Lauchli in a demonstration of rapid-fire mortar shooting.
     Mrs._DePugh , the mother of five children and an active member of her husband 's organization , participated in_all the exercises.
     There were no  casualties  , but the  guerrillas  admitted to being  a_little tired  when the leaders called a halt at 9 A._M. to enable out-of-town members to catch a plane.
    
    I would like to add one more practical reform to those mentioned by Russell_Kirk [ Dec. 16 ].
   It has to do with teachers ' salaries and tenure.
     Next September , after receiving a degree from Yale 's Master_of_Arts_in_Teaching Program , I will be teaching somewhere - that_much is guaranteed by the present shortage of mathematics_teachers.
   I will also be underpaid.
   The amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers.
   Teaching is at_present a sellers ' market ; as a result buyers , the public , must be satisfied with second-rate teachers.
   But this is not the real problem ; the rub arises from the fact that teachers are usually paid on the basis of time served rather_than quality.
   Hence all teachers , good and bad , who have been teaching for a given number of years are paid the same salary.
   I am firmly convinced that considering the average quality of teachers in_this country , the profession is grossly overpaid.
     It follows that teachers as_a_group cannot expect any marked salary increases ; there is a limit to how much the public will pay for shoddy performance.
   The only hope which good teachers have for being paid their due is to stop dragging the dead weight of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them.
   The only hope which the public has for getting good teachers is to pay teachers on the basis of merit rather_than tenure.
   Here , as in_all sectors of the economy , quality and justice are both dependent_on the right of the individual to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses.
     On the eve of the  great debate  on the proposal to give the President broad powers to make across-the-board tariff concessions which could practically bring us into the Atlantic_Community , we should face the alternatives on this proposition.
   What we will be sacrificing in any such arrangement will be our power to be selective which is contained in the reciprocal trade principle under which we now operate.
   Without this power we lay open any American industry which the Europeans may find it economically profitable to destroy to the will of others.
   It is this loss of initiative in how we conduct our economy which may lead to the loss of initiative in how we conduct our political affairs.
     I disagree with Mr._Burnham 's position on the Common_Market [ Nov. 18 ] as a desirable organization for us to join.
   For him to ignore the political consequences involved in an Atlantic_Union of_this kind is difficult to understand.
   The pressure for our entry to the Common_Market is mounting and we will proceed towards this amalgamated trade_union by way of a purely  economic thoroughfare  , or garden path , with the political ramifications kept neatly in the background.
   The appeal is going_to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing to those who do not see its relation_to political and legal , as_well as economic , self-rule.
   In entering this union we will be surrendering most , if_not all , of our economic autonomy to international bodies such_as the Atlantic_Institute ( recently set_up ) or the O._E._C._D. , I._M._F. and_others.
   To think that we can merely relinquish our economic autonomy without giving_up our political or legal autonomy is wishful_thinking.
     If it is not enough that all_of our internationalist One Worlders are advocating that we join this market , I refer you to an article in the New_York Times ' magazine section [ Nov. 12 , 1961 ] , by Mr._Eric_Johnston , entitled  We Must Join the Common_Market .
   He says :  It has swept aside petty nationalisms , age-old rivalries , and worn-out customs .
   Referring to Britain , he says ,  We see a nation that traditionally values sovereignty above_all else willing to give_up its economy , placing this authority in Continental hands .
   Since the goal of our international planners is a World_Government , this Atlantic_Community would mark a giant step in that direction for , once American economic autonomy is absorbed , a larger grouping is a question of time.
   Frankly , it is being very cleverly done for , in_a_sense , they have us over a barrel.
   Listen to what Mr._Johnston has to say :  Consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict.
   We would lose our export markets and deny ourselves the imports we need.
   We would be crippled by reduced output , industrial decline , widespread unemployment .
     But the solution to this dilemma is not the incorporation of the United_States into an Atlantic_Community or  economic empire  , but merely what libertarians like Henry_Hazlitt and Ludwig_von_Mises have been arguing for years : an end to government regulations , an end to government competition in industry , and a realistic depreciation_allowance for industry.
   Create a free market here , give us a sound , debt-free money system , and we 'll compete with anyone , Europe and Asia combined.
   In_short , get this governmental monstrosity off our backs and we won n't have to worry about European competition or Communism either.
   If we want to preserve our sovereignty , this is the way to do it ; not acquiesce to an international planning_board.
   If we go_into this Common_Market , we might just_as well stop talking_about Constitutional guarantees , Connally Amendments or , for_that_matter , conservatism in_general.
     We welcome this able brief for the negative as part of a many-sided discussion of the Atlantic Common_Market which NR will be continuing in our pages.

     The Peiping Chinese were the only major silver seller in the world markets who stopped selling the metal on Monday morning , November 27 , anticipating by two days the announcement of the U._S._Treasury that the pegged offering price will be removed.
     In 1954 I was drafted and after serving two years honorably on Active Duty I was not required to participate in any further Army_Reserve activities.
   Now , more_than five years later , I cannot in any realistic sense be called a trained soldier.
   But , in_spite_of this , I , at_present a man 31 years of_age and a College_Professor , have been recalled  by direction of the President  to report on November 25 th to Fort_Devens , Massachusetts , for another twelve months of Active Duty as an Sp 4 ( the equivalent of a PFC ).
   Today , seven years after the date of my initial induction as a draftee , I am Assistant_Professor of Philosophy and Science at St._Michael 's College.
   For , after leaving the Army in 1956 , I spent five years in Graduate_School first at Boston_College and_then at the University of Toronto.
   This time , added_to that which I had already spent in school prior to my induction in 1954 , makes a total of twenty-two ( 22 ) years of education.
     The possibility of recall into the Army is part of the price that a modern American has to pay for the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoys.
   With this no loyal citizen can quarrel.
   However , it seems axiomatic that the government has an obligation  to exercise its mandate reasonably , equitably and with full regard for the disruptions which it inevitably causes .
   In my own case , I submit that such reasonable and fair exercise is woefully lacking.
   Taken_back into the Army now as an Sp 4 , I am leaving 110 college_students whose teacher I am.
   ( A wry sidelight on this is that most_of my students have deferments from the draft in_order_to attend my classes.
 )   At this late date , it is impossible for St._Michael 's College to find a suitable replacement for me.
   Even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal life is being totally disrupted for the second time for no very compelling reason - I cannot help looking_around at the black leather jacket brigades standing idly on the street_corners and in the taverns of every American city and asking myself if our society has gone mad.
     In news broadcasts I consistently hear the foreign volunteers fighting in the Katanga_Army referred to as mercenaries.
   This confuses me no_end.
   If the Hessian troops sent here willy-nilly by the Hessian Government to fight for England in the 1770 's were mercenaries , what shall we call the UN troops sent to the Congo willy-nilly by their governments to fight for the United_Nations?
   If the UN troops are not mercenaries then the Hessians were not mercenaries either.
   And if the foreigners fighting in the Katanga_Army are mercenaries then Lafayette and von_Steuben were mercenaries too , as were also the members of the Lafayette_Escadrille in the early part of World_War 1 , and of Chennault 's Flying_Tigers in the early days of World_War 2 ,.
     It does n't take a Gore_Vidal to tell you what 's wrong with Cherokee_Textile 's slogan [  Pitney-Bowes Objects  , July_1 ].
   It 's an eighteenth-century negative , man!
   Suggest the following twenty-first-century amendment :   By moving the term  Republic  to lower_case , substituting the modern phrase  move ahead  for the stodgy  keep  , and by using the Postmaster 's name on every envelope ( in caps , of_course , with the  in spite  as faded as possible ) , the slogan cannot fail.
     In the issue of March 5 , 1960 you had an excellent editorial which said :      On trial in Jakarta for having flown for the Indonesian anti-Communist insurgents , U._S. pilot Alan_Lawrence_Pope boldly told the court that in supporting the freedom fighters , he was actually defending the sovereignty and independence of Indonesia.
   Facing a prosecution which has demanded the death_penalty , he said : ' I have participated in the war against Communism in Korea and at Dienbienphu , and I have helped in the evacuation of North Vietnamese to the free_world.
   I have done all this for the freedom of the individuals concerned and also for the states which have been threatened by Communist domination '.
   At_least in Indonesia , Khrushchev found an American proud to be at total war with Communism !
     Since then nothing has happened to save the life of Pope.
   I found recently a very small article in the New_York Times :      U._S. Flier loses Plea.
   Indonesia_Court Upholds Pope 's Death Sentence.
   - Indonesia_Military Supreme_Court has confirmed the death sentence passed on Alan_Lawrence_Pope , an American pilot.
   Pope was convicted last year of having aided North Celebes rebels by flying bombing missions.
   He has been in prison since May , 1958 , when his aircraft was shot_down over Moluccas.
   He may appeal_to President_Sukarno for clemency .
     As we see , Pope may appeal_to President_Sukarno , Khrushchev 's friend , for clemency.
   This possibility is anything but reassuring.
     The Eleanor_Roosevelt Tractor_Committee acts on behalf of the Cuban freedom fighters.
   But who will act now and immediately to save the life of Alan_Pope?
   Are tractors available for him?
   Does anybody think_of saving the life of an anti-Communist American pilot?
     A_few days before I saw your mention of_what Texas Liberals were doing to promote  Louis_Capet  [  The Week  , June 3 ] , another analogy had occurred to me.
     Consider this table :     Louis 14 , - FDR.
    With no strong men and no parliament to dispute his will , he was the government .
     Regency - Truman.
    A ' dust-settling ' period of decadence and decline .
     Louis 15 , - Eisenhower.
    He opened his mouth , said little , and thought not_at_all .
     Louis 16 , - Kennedy.
    Not completely virtuous , but completely incompetent .
     And Marie_Antoinette - Jacqueline_Bouvier.
    the beautiful and light-hearted .
     French_Revolution - Conservative_Revolution?
     Truly , that Liberals should choose Louis 14 , as a bogey-symbol of conservatism is grotesquely ironic , considering the Louis 14 , character of their Grand Monarque , FDR : not_only in his accretion of absolute power and personal deification , ( le roi gouverne par lui meme ) , but in the disastrous effects of his spending and war policies.
     In defeating  Louis_Capet  , John_Tower 's victory in Texas signals , once_again , the end of the divine right of Liberalism.
    
    It seems to me that N._C. , in his editorial  Confrontation  [ SR , Mar. 25 ] , has hit upon the real problem that bothers all_of us in a complex world : how do we retain our personal relationship with those who suffer?
   This affects us all intimately , and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress.
   I know of no other solution than the one N._C. proposes - to do what we can for each sufferer as he confronts us , hoping that this will spread beyond him to others at_some_time and some place.
   Never have I seen this expressed so clearly and so sympathetically.
     Thank_you for the illustrated editorial  Confrontation .
   It is both great writing and profound religion.
     N._C. has said something important so well that this preacher will many_times be tempted to quote the whole piece.
     I feel that N._C. hit the very core of our existence in the editorial  Confrontation .
   Personally , it meant a great_deal ; my only hope is that it will be shared by many , many others.
      Confrontation  should fortify us all , whether in Southeast_Asia or the U._S..
     Congratulations to N._C. for successfully delving into the heart of the problems that face the Peace_Corps.
   I concur that it is necessary for Americans to have a confrontation of the situation existing in foreign lands.
   It would be heartbreaking to see idealism , and hence effective leadership , thwarted by the poverty and hardship which young Americans will run_into.
     The editorial  Confrontation  was certainly direct in its appear to those of us living here in America.
   I personally gained strength from_it.
   Thanks for continuing to capture the attention and uncover so many areas of need in_this amazing world.
     N. C.
 's editorial  Confrontation  is a stunning piece of writing.
   I would hope that Sargent_Shriver will encourage everyone entering the Peace_Corps to read it.
   The important people to humanity are not the Khrushchevs and the Castros - but the Schweitzers and the Dooleys , and the others like them whose names we will never know.
     Editor 's note : Reprints of  Confrontation  will be included among the material_to be distributed to members of the Peace_Corps.
   A Peace_Corps official described the editorial as  precisely the message we need_to communicate to the men and women who will soon be Peace_Corps volunteers .
     F._L._Lucas 's article in SR 's April 1 issue seemed to be a very fair and objective analysis of the New_English_Bible.
   I certainly hope this will be the impression left in the minds of readers , rather_than the comment by Cleveland_Amory in his First Of The Month column.
   It is blind , fundamentalist dogmatism to say ,  Messing_around with the King_James_version seems to us a perilous sport at_best .
     Lester_Markel is on_the_right track in his article  Interpretation of Interpretation  [ SR , Mar. 11 ].
   The current stereotype of straight news reporting was probably invaluable in protecting the press and its readers from pollution by that combination of doctored fact , fancy , and personal opinion called yellow_journalism which flourished in_this country more_than a generation ago.
     We do n't need this type of protection any_more.
   The public is now armed with sophistication and numerous competing media.
   Besides , there are no_longer enough corruptible journalists about.
     The accepted method of writing news has two major liabilities.
   First , it does not communicate.
   A reporter restricted to the competing propaganda statements of both sides in a major labor dispute , for_instance , is unable to tell his readers half of_what he knows about the causes of the dispute.
   Second , it subjects the news to distortion by the unscrupulous.
   The charges by the late junior Senator from Wisconsin not_only destroyed innocent people but misled the nation.
   Yet the press was powerless to put these charges in perspective in its news columns.
   despite several years of front-page stories , the average citizen was unable to get a complete picture of McCarthy until he saw on the television screen what the reporters had been seeing all_along but had no effective way of communicating.
   The Senator had boxed them in with their own restrictions.
     It seems to me the time has come for the American press to start experimenting with ways of reporting the news that will do a better job of communicating and will be less subject_to abuse by those who have learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve their own ends.
   The objective should be to provide a method of getting into print a higher percentage than is now possible of the relevant information in the possession of reporters and editors.
     I would like to see you devote some space in an early issue to the news blackout concerning President_Kennedy 's activities , so_far as Southern_California is concerned.
   You have on more_than one occasion praised the idea of a televised press_conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent opinions.
     To_begin_with , the all-powerful Los_Angeles Times does not publish a transcript of these press_conferences.
   I am sure that they did when Eisenhower was President.
     Next , because of the time differential , the conferences come_on the networks during the middle of the day.
   Up until_now , the networks have grudgingly run half-hour tapes at 5 P._M. or sometimes 7 or 10 : 30 P._M..
   Even then , a_few of the  less interesting  questions are edited_out and glibly summarized by a commentator.
   However , last night the tapes were not run at_all during the evening hours and all we got on TV were a_few snatches which Douglas_Edwards and Huntley and Brinkley could squeeze into their programs.
   This is no criticism of them , as they obviously cannot get a half-hour program into a fifteen-minute news summary.
     The radio_stations did run  transcripts  ( I thought ) during the evening hours.
   However , by comparing the TV snatches , two different radio_station re-runs , and the censored Los_Angeles Times version , I found that the radio_stations had edited_out questions ( ABC removed the one regarding Laos ) or even a paragraph out of the middle of the President 's answer.
   I am interested to know he is getting mail from all_over the country about the  abuse  he is being subjected to.
   We out here do n't see enough of the conference to know he is being abused.
     I do n't know if this is the situation in other parts of the country ; apparently it is not.
   It also happened with the Inauguration , which was not re-run at_all during the evening hours , and I wrote to the TV editor of the Times.
   He did mention in his column the fact that he had received many letters about this and he himself did not understand the networks and the independent local stations ' not doing this - but nothing happened.
     Can you bring the networks ' attention to this?
     I was interested in James_Webb_Young 's MADISON AVENUE column in_which he raised the question  Do We Need a College of Propaganda ?
   [ SR , Feb. 11 ].
     In my estimation , we definitely do ; and the sad part of_it is that we had one , which was rounding into excellent shape , and we let it disintegrate and die.
     During the war , we set_up schools for the teaching of psychological_warfare , which included the teaching of propaganda , both black_and_white and the various shades of grey in_between.
   We had a_couple_of schools in_this country , the principal one being on the Marshall_Field estate out in Lloyd 's Neck.
   There were also a couple in Canada , and several in England.
   The_English schools preceded ours , and by the time we got_into it they had learned a_lot about the techniques of propaganda and its teaching.
     Four of us here in the United_States attended , first as students , then as instructors , almost every one of these schools , in England , Canada , and the United_States.
   We set_up the Lloyd 's Neck school , worked_out its curriculum , and taught there.
   Toward the end of the war , we really felt that we had learned something about propaganda and_how to teach it.
     When the end did come , and the schools were disbanded and abandoned , we felt and hoped that the machinery of psychological_warfare would not be allowed to rust.
   We hoped that its practitioners and teachers might be put on some sort_of reserve list and called_back for refresher_courses each_year or_so.
   Alas , no such thing happened.
   There apparently is no school of propaganda or psychological_warfare.
   A study at the Pentagon and at the service academies revealed that nothing was being done there.
   And not_one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been called_on to apply any of his knowledge in_any_way.
     Congratulations on the article  Do We Need a College of Propaganda ?
   This is one of the_most constructive suggestions made in_this critical field in years , and I certainly hope it sparks some action.
     Many_of us in_public relations were flattered that Richard_L._Tobin chose to devote his editorial in the March 11 Communications Supplement to the merger of the Public_Relations Society of America and the American Public_Relations Association.
     I was surprised and sorry to find in your issue of March 4 a long and detailed attack upon a book that had not_yet been published.
     Whether in his forthcoming book C._P._Snow commits the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily autobiographical critic charged him is important.
   One should be able_to get_hold_of the book at_once.
   But the attack was made from an advance copy.
   If this practice should take_root and spread , the man who submits a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed before he is accepted and publication will become a sort_of post-mortem formality.
     Editor 's Note : Sir_Robert_Watson-Watt wrote , on page 50 of SR / Research for 4 March 1961 :  I have read an advance copy of the Snow book which is to be titled , ' Science and Government '.
   Until the work actually appears I am not privileged to analyze it publicly in_detail.
   But I have compared its text with already published commentaries on the 1960 series of Godkin lectures at Harvard , from which the book was derived , and I can with_confidence challenge the gist of C._P._Snow 's incautious tale .
     Watson-Watt 's remarks in SR did not then , constitute a review of the book but a rebuttal to the Godkin Lectures.
   Representatives of Harvard_University Press , which is publishing the book this month of April , recognize and freely acknowledge that they invited such reaction by allowing Life magazine to print an excerpt from the book in_advance of the book 's publication date.
   The text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression than the prepublication excerpt.
     Sir_Robert_Watson-Watt 's  rebuttal  of Sir_Charles_Snow 's Godkin Lectures is marred throughout by too forceful a desire to defend Lindemann and apparently himself from Sir_Charles ' supposed falsehoods while stating those  falsehoods  in an unclear incoherent argument.
     The article presents the reader with an absurdity at its beginning.
   It calls the conclusion admitted valid by  historians and military strategists alike  a  perverted conclusion & & & nonsense .
     It submits an enthusiastic , impressionistic conception of Lindemann contributing another aspect of the man , but on no_more authoritative basis than Sir_Charles ' account.
   We are left to choose between the two Lindemanns.
     The only fact that holds any weight in the article is the result of the tea_party.
   But we are to believe that Lindemann actively supported radar outside the Tizard_Committee , and dissembling , discounted it inside?
   If so , I would lean to Sir_Charles ' conception of the man.
     I think it was a grave error to print the article at this time.
   To the unfortunate people unable to attend the Godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the book which may dissuade some people from reading it.
    
    Francois D ' Albert , Hungarian-born violinist who made his New_York debut three years ago , played a return engagement last night in Judson_Hall.
   He is now president of the Chicago_Conservatory_College.
   His pianist was Donald_Jenni , a faculty_member at DePaul_University.
     The acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged by the artists , so_that for the first_half of the program , when the piano was partially open , Mr._Jenni 's playing was too loud.
   In vying with him , Mr. D ' Albert also seemed to be overdriving his tone.
     This was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the performances , however , except in the case of the opening work , Mozart 's Sonata in A ( K. 526 ) , which clattered along noisily in an unrelieved fashion.
     Brahm 's Sonata in A , although also vigorous , stood_up well under the two artists ' strong , large-scale treatment.
   Mr. D ' Albert has a firm , attractive tone , which eschews an overly sweet vibrato.
   He made the most of the long Brahmsian phrases , and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work a handsome performance.
     A Sonata for Violin and Piano , called  Bella_Bella  , by Robert_Fleming , was given its first United_States performance.
   The title refers to the nickname given his wife by the composer , who is also a member of the National_Film_Board of Canada.
   The work 's two movements , one melodically sentimental , the other brightly capricious , are clever enough in a Ravel-like style , but they rehash a wornout idiom.
   They might well indicate conjugal felicity , but in musical terms that smack of Hollywood.
     Works by Dohnanyi , Hubay , Mr. D ' Albert himself and Paganini , indicated that the violinist had some virtuoso fireworks up his sleeve as_well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase.
   Standard items by Sarasate and Saint-Saens completed the program.
     In recent years Anna_Xydis has played with the New_York Philharmonic and at Lewisohn_Stadium , but her program last night at Town_Hall was the Greek-born pianist 's first New_York recital since 1948.
     Miss_Xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard , and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control.
   And the tone she commands is always beautiful in sound.
     Since she also has considerable technical virtuosity and a feeling for music in the romantic tradition , Miss_Xydis gave her listeners a good_deal of pleasure.
   She played with style and a touch of the grand manner , and every piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures.
     The second_half of her program was devoted_to Russian composers of_this century.
   It was in them that Miss_Xydis was at her best.
   The Rachmaninoff_Prelude No.
12 , Op. 32 , for_instance , gave her an opportunity to exploit one of her special facilities - the ability to produce fine deep-sounding bass tones while contrasting them simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the treble.
     The four Kabalevsky Preludes were also assured , rich_in color and songful.
   And the Prokofieff_Seventh_Sonata had the combination of romanticism and modern bravura that Prokofieff needs.
     Miss_Xydis ' earlier selections were Mendelssohn 's Variations Serieuses , in_which each variation was nicely set_off from the others ; Haydn 's Sonata in E minor , which was unfailingly pleasant in sound , and Chopin 's Sonata in B flat minor.
   A memory lapse in the last somewhat marred the pianist 's performance.
   So what was the deepest music on her program had the poorest showing.
   Miss_Xydis was best when she did not need to be too probing.
     All the generals who held important commands in World_War 2 , did not write books.
   It only seems as if they did.
   And the best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written.
   One of the very best is only now published in_this country , five years after its first publication in England.
   It is  Defeat Into Victory  , by Field_Marshal Viscount_Slim.
     A long book heavily weighted with military technicalities , in_this edition it is neither so_long nor so technical as it was originally.
   Field_Marshal Slim has abridged it for the benefit of  those who , finding not so great an attraction in accounts of military moves and counter-moves , are more interested in men and their reactions to stress , hardship and danger .
   The man whose reactions and conclusions get the_most space is , of_course , the Field_Marshal himself.
     William_Joseph_Slim , First_Viscount_Slim , former Governor_General of Australia , was the principal British commander in the field during the Burma_War.
   He had been a corps commander during the disastrous defeat and retreat of 1942 when the ill-prepared , ill-equipped British forces  were outmaneuvered , outfought and outgeneraled .
   He returned in command of an international army of Gurkhas , Indians , Africans , Chinese and British.
   And in_a_series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles and hills and along the great rivers of Burma he waged one of the_most brilliant campaigns of the war.
    The Forgotten_War  his soldiers called the Burma fighting because the war in Africa and Europe enjoyed priorities in equipment and in headlines.
     Parts of  Defeat Into Victory  are a tangle of Burmese place_names and military_units , but a_little application makes everything clear enough.
   On_the_whole this is an interesting and exceptionally well-written book.
   Field_Marshal Slim is striking in description , amusing in many anecdotes.
   He has a pleasant sense_of_humor and is modest enough to admit mistakes and even  a cardinal error .
   He praises many individuals generously.
   He himself seems to be tough , tireless , able and intelligent , more intellectual and self-critical than most soldiers.
      Defeat Into Victory  is a dramatic and lively military narrative.
   But it is most interesting in its account of the unending problems of high_command , of decisions and their reasons , of the myriad matters that demand attention in_addition to battle action.
     Before he could return to Burma , Field_Marshal Slim had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite them with fresh recruits.
   His remarks about training , discipline , morale , leadership and command are enlightening.
   He believed_in making inspiring speeches and he made a great many.
   He believed_in being seen near the front_lines and he was there.
   For general morale reasons and to encourage the efforts of his supply_officers , when food was short for combat troops he cut the rations of his headquarters_staff accordingly.
     Other crucial matters required constant supervision :   labor and all noncombatant troops , whose morale was vital , too ; administrative organization and delicate diplomatic relations with Top Brass - British , American and Chinese ; health , hygiene , medical_aid and preventive_medicine ; hospitals ( inadequate ) and nurses ( scanty ) ; food and military supplies ; logistics and transport ; airdrops and airstrips ; roads and river barges to be built.
     Commenting on these and other matters , Field_Marshal Slim makes many frank and provocative remarks :      When in doubt as to two courses of action , a general should choose the bolder .
      The commander has failed in his duty if he has not won victory - for that is his duty .
      It only does harm to talk to troops about new and desirable equipment which others may have but which you cannot give them.
   It depresses them.
   So I made no mention of air transport until we could get at least some of_it .
     Field_Marshal Slim is more impressed by the courage of Japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their commanders.
   Of the Japanese private he says :  He fought and marched till he died.
   If 500 Japanese were ordered to hold a position , we had to kill 495 before it was ours - and_then the last five killed themselves .
     Brooding about future wars , the Field_Marshal has this to say :  The Asian fighting man is at_least equally brave [ as the white ] , usually more careless_of death , less encumbered by mental doubts , less troubled by humanitarian sentiment , and not so moved by slaughter and mutilation around him.
   He is , by background and living standards , better fitted to endure hardship uncomplainingly , to demand less in the way of subsistence or comfort , and to look_after himself when thrown on_his_own resources .
     A bunch of young buckaroos from out West , who go_by the name of Texas Boys Choir , loped into Town_Hall last night and succeeded in corralling the hearts of a sizable audience.
     Actually , the program they sang was at_least two-thirds serious and high-minded , and they sang it beautifully.
   Under the capable direction of the choir 's founder , Geroge_Bragg , the twenty-six boys made some lovely sounds in an opening group of Renaissance and baroque madrigals and motets , excerpts from Pergolesi 's  Stabat_Mater  and all_of the Britten  Ceremonial of Carols .
     Their singing was well-balanced , clear and , within obvious limitations , extremely pleasing.
   The limitations are those one expects from untrained and unsettled voices - an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity , an occasional waver and now_and_then a bleat.
     But Mr._Bragg is a remarkably gifted conductor , and the results he has produced with his boys are generally superior.
   Most surprising of all , he has accomplished some prodigies in training for the production of words.
   The Latin , for_example , was not_only clear ; it was even beautiful.
     Furthermore , there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation of the music.
   Lines came_out neatly and in good balance.
   Tempos were lively.
   The piano accompaniments by Istvan_Szelenyi were stylish.
     A boy soprano named Dixon_Boyd sang a Durante solo motet and a_few other passages enchantingly.
   Other capable soloists included David_Clifton , Joseph_Schockler and Pat_Thompson.
     The final group included folk_songs from back home , stomped out , shouted and chanted with irresistible spirit and in cowboy costume.
   Boys will be boys , and Texans will be Texans.
   The combination proved quite irresistible last night.
     The Polish song_and_dance company called Mazowsze , after the region of Poland , where it has its headquarters , opened a three-week engagement at the City_Center last night.
   A thoroughly ingratiating company it is , and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all evening.
     Not that it is all funny , by_any_means , though some of_it is definitely so , but simply that the dancers are young and handsome , high-spirited and communicative , and the program itself is as vivacious as_it is varied.
   There is no use at_all in trying to follow it dance by dance and title by title , for it has a kind_of nonstop format , and moves along in an admirable continuity that demands no pauses for identification.
     The material is all basically of folk origin , gleaned from every section of Poland.
   But under the direction of Mira_Ziminska-Sygietynska , who with her late husband founded the organization in 1948 , it has all been put into theatrical form , treated selectively , choreographed specifically for presentation to spectators , and performed altogether professionally.
   Under the surface of the wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical ballet training , and an equally professional sense of performing.
     Since the organization was created thirteen years ago , it is obvious that this is not the original company ; it is more likely the sons and daughters of_that company.
   The girls are charming children and the men are wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters.
   The stage is constantly full_of them ; indeed , there are never fewer than eight of them on stage , and that is only for the more intimate numbers.
   They can be exuberant or sentimental , flirtatious or funny , but the only thing they seem unable to be is dull.
     To pick_out particular numbers is something of a problem , but one or two identifiable items are too conspicuously excellent to be missed.
   There is for_example , a stunning Krakowiak that closes the first act ; the mazurka choreographed by Witold_Zapala to music from Moniuszko 's opera ,  Strasny_Dwor ' , may be the_most beautiful mazurka you are likely ever to see ; there is an enchanting polonaise ; and the dances and songs from the Tatras contain a magnificent dance for the men.
     Everywhere there are little touches of humor , and the leader of the on-stage band of musicians is an ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments with winning warmth.
    
    The superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of William_James was never more evident than in his letters.
   Here was a man with an enormous gift for living as_well as thinking.
   To both persons and ideas he brought the same delighted interest , the same open-minded relish for what was unique in each , the same discriminating sensibility and quicksilver intelligence , the same gallantry of judgment.
     For this latest addition to the Great Letters Series , under the general editorship of Louis_Kronenberger , Miss_Hardwick has made a selection which admirably displays the variety of James 's genius , not_to_mention the felicities of his style.
   And_how he could write!
   His famous criticism of brother Henry 's  third style  is surely as subtly , even elegantly , worded an analysis of the latter 's intricate air_castles as Henry himself could ever have produced.
   His letter to his daughter on the pains of growing_up is surely as trenchant , forthright , and warmly understanding a_piece of advice as ever a grown-up penned to a sensitive child , and with just the right tone of unpatronizing good_humor.
     Most_of_all , his letters to his philosophic colleagues show a magnanimity as_well as an honesty which help to explain Whitehead 's reference_to James as  that adorable genius .
   Miss_Hardwick speaks of his  superb gift for intellectual friendship  , and it is certainly a joy to see the intellectual life lived so free from either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism.
     This is a virtue of_which we have great need in a society where there seems to be an increasing lack of communication - or even desire for communication - between differing schools_of_thought.
   It holds an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word  intellectual  has become a term of opprobrium to millions of well-meaning people who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human virtues.
     To his Harvard colleague , Josiah_Royce , whose philosophic position differed radically from his own , James could write ,  Different as our minds are , yours has nourished mine , as no other social influence ever has , and in converse with you I have always felt that my life was being lived importantly .
     Of another colleague , George_Santayana , he could write :  The great event in my life recently has been the reading of Santayana 's book.
   Although I absolutely reject the Platonism of_it , I have literally squealed with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the position is laid_down on page after page .
     Writing to his colleague George_Herbert_Palmer -  Glorious old Palmer  , as he addresses him - James says that if only the students at Harvard could really understand Royce , Santayana , Palmer , and himself and see that their varying systems are  so many religions , ways of fronting life , and worth fighting for  , then Harvard would have a genuine philosophic universe.
    The best condition of_it would be an open conflict and rivalry of the diverse systems.
   The world might ring with the struggle , if we devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other .
     The  belaboring  is of_course jocular , yet James was not lacking in fundamental seriousness - unless we measure him by that ultimate seriousness of the great religious_leader or thinker who stakes all on his vision of God.
   To James this vision never quite came , despite his appreciation of_it in others.
     But there is a dignity and even a hint of the inspired prophet in his words to one correspondent :  You ask what I am going_to ' reply ' to Bradley.
   But why need one reply to everything and everybody?
   I think that readers generally hate minute polemics and recriminations.
   All polemic of ours should , I believe , be either very broad statements of contrast , or fine points treated singly , and as_far_as_possible impersonally.
   As far as the rising generation goes , why not simply express ourselves positively , and trust that the truer view quietly will displace the other.
   Here again ' God will know his own  '.
     The collected works of James_Thurber , now numbering 25 volumes ( including the present exhibit ) represent a high standard of literary excellence , as every schoolboy knows.
   The primitive-eclogue quality of his drawings , akin to_that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall , is equally well_known.
   About all that remains to be said is that the present selection , most_of which appeared first in The New_Yorker , comprises ( as_usual ) a slightly unstrung necklace , held together by little more_than a slender thread cunningly inserted in the spine of the book.
     The one unifying note , if any , is sounded in the initial article entitled :  How to Get_Through the Day .
   It is repeated at intervals in some rather sadly desperate word-games for insomniacs , the hospitalized , and_others forced to rely_on inner_resources , including ( in the P 's alone )  palindromes  ,  paraphrases  , and  parodies .
      The Tyranny of Trivia  suggests arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber.
   And new vistas of hairshirt asceticism are opened by scholarly monographs entitled :    Friends , Romans , Countrymen , Lend Me Your Ear-Muffs  ,  Such a Phrase as Drifts Through Dream  , and  The New_Vocabularianism .
   Some of Thurber 's curative methods involve strong potions of mixed metaphor , malapropism , and gobbledygook and are recommended for use only in extreme cases.
     A burlesque paean entitled :  Hark the Herald_Tribune , Times , and All the Other Angels Sing  brilliantly succeeds in exaggerating even motion-picture ballyhooey.
    How_the_Kooks_Crumble  features an amusingly accurate take-off on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radio - TV commercials , and  The Watchers of the Night  is a veritable waking nightmare.
     A semi-serious literary document entitled  The Wings of Henry_James  is noteworthy , if only for a keenly trenchant though little-known comment on the master 's difficult later period by modest Owen_Wister , author of  The Virginian .
   James , he remarks in a letter to a friend ,  is attempting the impossible , namely , to produce upon the reader , as a painting produces upon the gazer , a_number_of superimposed , simultaneous impressions.
   He would like to put several sentences on top of each other so_that you could read them all_at_once , and get all_at_once , the various shadings and complexities .
     Equally penetrating in its fashion is the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation :    So_much has already been written about everything that you can n't find_out anything about it .
   Or the mildly epigrammatic utterance ( also a quotation ) :  Woman 's place is in the wrong .
   Who but Thurber can be counted_on to glean such nectareous essences?
     A tribute to midsummer  bang-sashes  seems terribly funny , though it would be hard to explain why.
    One of them banged the sash of the window nearest my bed around midnight in July and I leaped out of sleep and out_of_bed.
   ' It 's just a bat ' said my wife reassuringly , and I sighed with relief.
   ' Thank God for that ' I said ; ' I thought it was a human_being  '.
     In_a_sense , perhaps , Thurber is indebted artistically to the surrealist painter ( was it Salvador_Dali?
 )   who first conceived the startling fancy of a picture_window in the abdomen.
   That_is , it is literally a picture_window : you do n't see into the viscera ; you see a picture - trees , or flowers.
   This is something like what Thurber 's best effects are like , if I am not mistaken.
     Though no_longer able to turn_out his protoplasmic pen-and-ink sketches ( several old favorites are scattered through the present volume ) Thurber has retained unimpaired his vision of humor as a thing of simple , unaffected humanness.
   In his concluding paragraph he writes :  The devoted writer of humor will continue to try to come as close_to truth as he can .
   For many readers Thurber comes closer than anyone else in_sight.
     The latest Low is a puzzler.
   The master 's hand has lost none of its craft.
   He is at his usual best in exposing the shams and self-deceptions of political and diplomatic life in the fifties.
   The reader meets a_few old friends like Blimp and the TUC horse , and becomes better acquainted_with new members of the cast_of_characters like the bomb itself , and civilization in her classic robe watching the nuclear arms_race , her hair standing straight out.
     But there is a difference between the present volume and the early Low.
   There is fear in the fifties as his title suggests and as his competent drawings show.
   But there was terror in the thirties when the Nazis were on_the_loose and in those days Low struck like lightning.
     Anyone can draw his own conclusions from this difference.
   It might be argued that the Communists are less inhuman than the Nazis and furnish the artist with drama in a lower key.
   But this argument cannot be pushed very far because the Communist system makes_up for any shortcomings of its leaders in respect_to corrosion.
   The Communists wield a power unknown to Hitler.
   And the leading issue , that of piecemeal aggression , remains the same.
   This is drama enough.
     Do we ourselves offer Mr._Low less of a crusade?
   In the thirties we would not face our enemy ; that was a nightmarish situation and Low was in his element.
   Now we have stood_up to the Communists ; we are stronger and more self-confident - and Low cannot so easily put us to rights.
     Or does the reason for less Jovian drawings lie elsewhere?
   It might be that Low has seen too many stupidities and that they do not outrage him now.
   He writes ,  Confucius held that in times of stress one should take short views - only up_to lunchtime .
     Whatever the cause , his mood in the fifties rarely rises above the level of the capably sardonic.
   Dulles?
   He does not seem to have caught the subtleties of the man.
   McCarthy?
   The skies turn dark but the clouds do not loose their wrath.
   Suez?
   Low seems to have supported Eden at_first and_then relented because things worked_out differently , so there is no fire in his eye.
     Stalin 's death , Churchill 's farewell to public life , Hillary and Tensing on Everest , Quemoy and Matsu - all subjects for a noble anger or an accolade.
   Instead the cartoons seem to deal with foibles.
   Their Eisenhower is insubstantial.
   Did Low decide to let well enough alone when he made his selections?
     He often drew the bomb.
   He showed puny men attacked by splendidly tyrannical machines.
   And Khrushchev turned_out to be prime copy for the_most witty caricaturist of them all.
   But , but and but.
     Look in_this book for weak mortals and only on_occasion for virtues and vices on the heroic scale.
   Read the moderately brief text , not for captions , sometimes for tart epigrams , once_in_a_while for an explosion in_the_middle of your fixed ideas.
     A gray_fox with a patch on one eye - confidence_man , city_slicker , lebensraum specialist - tries to take_over Catfish_Bend in_this third relaxed allegory from Mr._Burman 's refreshing Louisiana animal community.
     The fox is all ingratiating smiles when he arrives from New_Orleans , accompanied by one wharf_rat.
   But like all despots , as he builds his following from among the gullible , he grows more threatening toward those who won n't follow - such solid citizens as Doc_Raccoon ; Judge_Black , the vegetarian black snake ; and the eagle , who leads the_bird community when he is not too busy in Washington posing for fifty-cent_pieces.
     As soon as the fox has taken_hold on most_of the populace he imports more wharf_rats , who , of_course , say they are the aggrieved victims of an extermination campaign in the city.
   ( The followers of bullies invariably are aggrieved about the very things they plan to do to others.
 )   They train the mink and other animals to fight.
   And pretty soon gray_fox is announcing that he won n't have anyone around that 's against him , and setting_out to break his second territorial treaty with the_birds.
     Robert_Hillyer , the poet , writes in his introduction to this brief animal fable that Mr._Burman ought_to win a Nobel_Prize for the Catfish_Bend series.
   He may have a point in urging that decadent themes be given fewer prizes.
   But it 's hard to imagine Mr._Burman as a Nobel_laureate on the basis of these charming but not really momentous fables.
     In substance they lie somewhere between the Southern dialect animal stories of Joel_Chandler_Harris ( Uncle_Remus ) and the polished , witty fables of James_Thurber.
    
    George_Kennan 's account of relations between Russia and the West from the fall of Tsarism to the end of World_War 2 , is the finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years.
   It combines qualities that are seldom found in one work : Scrupulous scholarship , a fund of personal experience , a sense of drama and characterization and a broad grasp of the era 's great historical issues.
     In_short , the book , based largely on lectures delivered at Harvard_University , is both reliable and readable ; the author possesses an uncommonly fine English style , and he is dealing with subjects of vast importance that are highly topical for our time.
   If Mr._Kennan is sometimes a_little somber in his appraisals , if his analysis of how Western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great_wars and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic - well , the record itself is not too encouraging.
     Mr._Kennan takes careful account of every mitigating circumstance in recalling the historical atmosphere in_which mistaken decisions were taken.
   But he rejects , perhaps a_little too sweepingly , the theory that disloyal and pro-Communist influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing Stalin which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high point at the Yalta_Conference in February , 1945.
     After_all , Alger_Hiss , subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he gave secret State_Department documents to Soviet agents , was at Yalta.
   And Harry_Dexter_White , implicated in F._B._I. reports in Communist associations , was one of the architects of the Morgenthau_Plan , which had it ever been put into full operation , would have simply handed Germany to Stalin.
   One item in_this unhappy scheme was to have Germany policed exclusively by its continental neighbors , among whom only the Soviet_Union possessed real military strength.
     It is quite probable , however , that stupidity , inexperience and childish adherence to slogans like  unconditional surrender  had more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than treason or sympathy with Communism.
   Mr._Kennan sums_up his judgment of_what went_wrong this way.
      You see , first_of_all and in_a_sense as the source of all other ills , the unshakeable American commitment to the principle of unconditional surrender : The tendency to view any war in_which we might be involved not as a means of achieving limited objectives in the way of changes in a given status_quo , but as a struggle to the death between total virtue and total evil , with the result that the war had absolutely to be fought to the complete destruction of the enemy 's power , no_matter what disadvantages or complications this might involve for the more distant future .
     Recognizing that there could have been no effective negotiated peace with Hitler , he points_out the shocking failure to give support to the anti-Nazi underground , which very_nearly eliminated Hitler in 1944.
   A veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge of Russian language , history and literature , Kennan recalls how , at_the_time of Hitler 's attack on the Soviet_Union in 1941 , he penned a private note to a State_Department official , expressing the hope that  never would we associate ourselves with Russian purposes in the areas of eastern Europe beyond her own boundaries .
     The hope was vain.
   With justified bitterness the author speaks of  what seems to me to have been an inexcusable body of ignorance about the nature of the Russian_Communist movement , about the history of its diplomacy , about what had happened in the purges , and about what had been going_on in Poland and the Baltic_States .
   He also speaks of Franklin_D._Roosevelt 's  puerile  assumption that  if only he ( Stalin ) could be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone like F._D._R. himself , ideological preconceptions would melt and Russia 's co-operation with the West could be easily arranged .
     No wonder Khrushchev 's first message to President_Kennedy was a wistful desire for the return of the  good old days  of Roosevelt.
     This fascinating story begins with a sketch , rich_in personal detail , of the glancing mutual impact of World_War 1 , and the two instalments of the Russian_Revolution.
   The first of these involved the replacement of the Tsar by a liberal Provisional_Government in March , 1917 ; the second , the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks ( who later called themselves Communists ) in November of the same year.
     As Kennan shows , the judgment of the Allied governments about what was happening in Russia was warped by the obsession of defeating Germany.
   They were blind_to the evidence that nothing could keep the Russian people fighting.
   They attributed everything that went_wrong in Russia to German influence and intrigue.
   This , more_than any other factor , led to the fiasco of Allied intervention.
   As the author very justly says :      Had a world_war not been in_progress , there would never , under any conceivable stretch of the imagination , have been an Allied intervention in North_Russia .
   The scope and significance of_this intervention have been grossly exaggerated by Communist propaganda ; here Kennan , operating with precise facts and figures , performs an excellent job of debunking.
     Of many passages in the book that exemplify the author 's vivid style , the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may be selected.
   On Stalin :      This was a man of incredible criminality , of a criminality effectively without limits ; a man apparently foreign to the very experience of love , without mercy or pity ; a man in whose entourage none was ever safe ; a man whose hand was set against all that could not be useful to him at the moment ; a man who was most dangerous of all to those who were his closest collaborators in crime .
     And here is Kennan 's image of Hitler , Stalin 's temporary collaborator in the subjugation and oppression of weaker peoples , and his later enemy :      Behind that Charlie_Chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always covered his forehead , behind the tirades and the sulky silences , the passionate orations and the occasional dull evasive stare , behind the prejudices , the cynicism , the total amorality of behavior , behind even the tendency to great strategic mistakes , there lay a statesman of no mean qualities :   Shrewd , calculating , in many ways realistic , endowed - like Stalin - with considerable powers of dissimulation , capable_of playing his cards very close_to his chest when he so desired , yet bold and resolute in his decisions , and possessing one gift Stalin did not possess : The ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken_word .
     Two criticisms of_this generally admirable and fascinating book involve the treatment of wartime diplomacy which is jagged at the edges - there is no mention of the Potsdam_Conference or the Morgenthau_Plan.
   And in a concluding chapter about America 's stance in the contemporary_world , one senses certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come_to_grips with the baffling riddle of our time : How to deal with a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war.
     But one should not ask for everything.
   Mr._Kennan , who has recently abandoned authorship for a new round of diplomacy as the recently appointed American ambassador to Yugoslavia , is not the only man who finds it easier to portray the past than to prescribe for the future.
   The story of a quarter of a century of Soviet-Western relations is vitally important , and it is told with the fire of a first-rate historical narrator.
   The Ireland we usually hear about in the theater is a place of bitter political or domestic unrest , lightened occasionally with flashes of native wit and charm.
   In  Donnybrook  , there is quite a different Eire , a rural land where singing , dancing , fist-fighting and romancing are the thing.
   There is plenty of violence , to_be_sure , but it is a nice violence and no one gets killed.
   By_and_large , Robert_McEnroe 's adaptation of Maurice_Walsh 's film ,  The Quiet Man  , provides the entertainment it set_out to , and we have a lively musical show if_not a superlative one.
     This is the tale of one John_Enright , an American who has accidentally killed a man in the prize_ring and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become a quiet man.
   But Innesfree , where Ellen_Roe_Danaher and her bullying brother , Will , live , is no place for a man who will not use his fists.
   So Enright 's courting of the mettlesome Ellen is impeded considerably , thereby providing the tale which is told.
   You may be sure he marries her in_the_end and has a fine old knockdown fight with the brother , and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way to ensure that you understand what the word Donnybrook means.
     Then there is a matchmaker , one Mikeen_Flynn , a role for which Eddie_Foy was happily selected.
   Now there is no reason in the world why a matchmaker in Ireland should happen also to be a talented soft-shoe dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs , torso and neck , except that these talents add immensely to the enjoyment of the play.
   Mr._Foy is a joy , having learned his dancing by practicing it until he is practically perfect.
   His matchmaking is , naturally , incidental , and it only serves Flynn right when a determined widow takes him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony.
     Art_Lund , a fine big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice , impersonates Enright.
   Although he is not graced with the subtleties of romantic technique , that 's not what an ex-prize fighter is supposed to have , anyway.
   Joan_Fagan , a fiery redhead who can impress you that she has a temper whether she really has one or not , plays Ellen , and sings the role very_well , too.
   If the mettle which Ellen exhibits has a_bit of theatrical dross in it , never mind ; she fits into the general scheme well enough.
     Susan_Johnson , as the widow , spends the first_half of the play running a bar and singing about the unlamented death of her late husband and the second_half trying to acquire a new one.
   She has a good , firm delivery of songs and adds to the solid virtues of the evening.
     Then there are a pair of old biddies played by Grace_Carney and Sibly_Bowan who may be right off the shelf of stock Irish characters , but they put such a combination of good_will and malevolence into their parts that they 're quite entertaining.
   And in the role of Will Danaher , Philip_Bosco roars and sneers sufficiently to intimidate not_only one American but the whole British army , if he chose.
      Donnybrook  is no  Brigadoon  , but it does have some very nice romantic background touches and some excellent dancing.
   The ballads are sweet and sad , and the music generally competent.
   It sometimes threatens to linger in the memory after the final curtain , and some of_it , such_as the catchy  Sez I  , does.
    A Toast To The Bride  , sung by Clarence_Nordstrom , playing a character called Old_Man Toomey , is quite simple , direct and touching.
     The men of Innesfree are got_up authentically in cloth_caps and sweaters , and their dancing and singing is fine.
   So is that of the limber company of lasses who whirl and glide and quickstep under Jack_Cole 's expert choreographic direction.
   The male dancers sometimes wear kilts and their performance in them is spirited and stimulating.
     Rouben_Ter-Arutunian , in his stage_settings , often uses the scrim curtain behind which Mr._Cole has placed couples or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow.
   There is no reason why most theatergoers should not have a pretty good time at  Donnybrook  , unless they are permanently in the mood of Enright when he sings about how easily he could hate the lovable Irish.
     We can all breathe more easily this morning - more easily and joyously , too - because Joshua_Logan has turned the stage show ,  Fanny  , into a delightful and heart-warming film.
     The task of taking the raw_material of Marcel_Pagnol 's original trio of French films about people of the waterfront in Marseilles and putting them again on the screen , after their passage through the Broadway musical idiom , was a delicate and perilous one , indeed.
   More_than the fans of Pagnol 's old films and of their heroic star , the great Raimu , were looking askance at the project.
   The fans of the musical were , too.
     But now the task is completed and the uncertainty resolved with the opening of the English-dialogue picture at the Music_Hall yesterday.
   Whether fan of the Pagnol films or stage show , whether partial_to music or no , you can n't help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense_of_humor and a heart.
    
    Some of the New_York Philharmonic musicians who live in the suburbs spent yesterday morning digging themselves free from snow.
   A tiny handful never did make the concert.
   But , after a fifteen-minute delay , the substantially complete Philharmonic assembled on stage for the afternoon 's proceedings.
   They faced a rather small audience , as quite_a_few subscribers apparently had decided to forego the pleasures of the afternoon.
     It was an excellent concert.
   Paul_Paray , rounding_out his current stint with the orchestra , is a solid musician , and the Philharmonic plays for him.
   Their collaboration in the Beethoven_Second_Symphony was lucid , intelligent and natural sounding.
   It was not a heavy , ponderous Beethoven.
   The music sang nicely , sprinted evenly when necessary , was properly accented and balanced.
     The Franck symphonic_poem ,  Psyche  , is a lush , sweet-sounding affair that was pleasant to encounter once_again.
   Fortunate for the music itself , it is not too frequent a visitor ; if it were , its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying.
     Mr._Paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic elements of the score.
   He did not let the strings , for_instance , weep , whine or get hysterical.
   His interpretation was a model of refinement and accuracy.
     And in the Prokofieff C major Piano_Concerto , with Zadel_Skolovsky as soloist , he was an admirable partner.
   Mr._Skolovsky 's approach to the concerto was bold , sweeping and tonally percussive.
   He swept_through the music with ease , in a non-sentimental and ultra-efficient manner.
     An impressive technician , Mr._Skolovsky has fine rhythm , to_boot.
   His tone is the weakest part of his equipment ; it tends to be hard and colorless.
   A school_of_thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this concerto needs.
   It is , after_all , a non-romantic work ( even with the big , juicy melody of the second movement ) ; and the composer himself was called the  age of steel pianist .
   But granted all this , one still would have liked to have heard a_little more tonal nuance than Mr._Skolovsky supplied.
     Taken as_a_whole , though , it was a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra.
   Mr._Skolovsky fully deserved the warm reception he received.
     A new work on the program was Nikolai_Lopatnikoff 's  Festival_Overture  , receiving its first New_York hearing.
   This was composed last year as a salute to the automobile_industry.
   It is not program music , though.
   It runs a_little more_than ten minutes , is workmanlike , busy , methodical and featureless.
      La_Gioconda  , like it or not , is a singer 's opera.
   And so , of_course , it is a fan 's opera as_well.
   Snow or no , the fans were present in_force at the Metropolitan_Opera last night for a performance of the Ponchielli work.
     So the plot creaks , the sets are decaying , the costumes are pre-historic , the orchestra was sloppy and not_very_well connected with what the singers were doing.
   After_all , the opera has juicy music to sing and the goodies are well distributed , with no_less_than six leading parts.
     One of those parts is that of evil , evil Barnaba , the spy.
   His wicked deeds were carried_on by Anselmo_Colzani , who was taking the part for_the_first_time with the company.
     He has the temperament and the stage presence for a rousing villain and he sang with character and strong tone.
   What was lacking was a real sense of phrase , the kind_of legato singing that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is , after_all , a very oily character.
     Regina_Resnik as Laura and Cesare_Siepi as Alvise also were new_to the cast , but only with_respect_to this season ; they have both sung these parts here before.
   Laura is a good role for Miss_Resnik , and she gave it force , dramatic color and passion.
     Mr._Siepi was , as always , a consummate actor ; with a_few telling strokes he characterized Alvise magnificently.
   Part of_this characterization was , of_course , accomplished with the vocal chords.
   His singing was strong and musical ; unfortunately his voice was out of focus and often spread in quality.
     Eileen_Farrell in the title_role , Mignon_Dunn as La_Cieca and Richard_Tucker as Enzo were holdovers from earlier performances this season , and all contributed to a vigorous performance.
   If only they and Fausto_Cleva in the_pit had got_together a_bit more.
      Melodious birds sing madrigals  saith the poet and no better description of the madrigaling of the Deller_Consort could be imagined.
     Their Vanguard album Madrigal Masterpieces ( BG 609 ; stereo BGS 5031 ) is a good sample of the special , elegant art of English madrigal singing.
   It also makes a fine introduction to the international art_form with good_examples of Italian and English madrigals plus several French  chansons .
     The_English have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better than anyone else.
   The original impulses came to England late ( in the sixteenth century ) and continue strong long after everyone else had gone_on to the baroque basso_continuo , sonatas , operas and the_like.
     Even after Elizabethan traditions were weakened by the Cromwellian interregnum , the practice of singing together - choruses , catches and glees - always flourished.
   The_English never_again developed a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier great age the way , say , the opera in Italy blotted_out the Italian madrigal.
     Latter-day interest in Elizabethan singing dates well back into the nineteenth century in England , much ahead of similar revivals in other countries.
   As a result no comparable literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more_often performed than the_English madrigal.
     Naturally , Mr._Deller and the other singers in his troupe are most charming and elegant when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their countrymen : William_Byrd , Thomas_Morley and Thomas_Tomkins.
   There is an almost instrumental quality to their singing , with a tendency to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture.
   Both techniques give the music purity and clarity.
     Claude_Jannequin 's vocal description of a battle ( the_French equivalents of tarantara , rum-tum-tum , and boom-boom-boom are very picturesque ) is lots_of fun , and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other chansons by Jannequin and Lassus.
   Only with the more sensual , intense and baroque expressions of Marenzio , Monteverdi and Gesualdo does the singing seem a_little superficial.
     Nevertheless , the musicality , accuracy and infectious charm of these performances , excellently reproduced , make it an attractive look-see at the period.
   The works are presented chronologically.
   Texts and translations are provided.
     The elements of elegance and color in Jannequin are strong French characteristics.
   Baroque instrumental music in Italy and Germany tends to be strong , lively , intense , controlled and quite abstract.
   In France , it remained always more picturesque , more dancelike , more full_of flavor.
     Couperin and Rameau gave titles to nearly everything they wrote , not in the later sense of  program music  but as a kind_of nonmusical reference for the close , clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise utterance.
     Both composers turn_up on new imports from France.
   BAM is the unlikely name of a French recording company whose full label is Editions de la boite a musique.
   They specialize in out-of-the-way items and old_French music naturally occupies a good_deal of their attention.
   Sonates et Concerts Royaux of Couperin le grand occupy two disks ( LD056 and LD060 ) and reveal the impeccable taste and workmanship of_this master - delicate , flexible and gemlike.
     The Concerts - Nos. 2 , 6 , 9 , 10 and 14 are represented - are really closer to chamber suites than to concertos in the Italian sense.
   The sonatas ,  La_Francaise  ,  La_Sultane  ,  L ' Astree  and  L ' Imperiale  , are often more elaborately worked_out and , in_fact , show a strong Italian influence.
     Couperin also turns_up along with some lesser-known contemporaries on a disk called Musique_Francaise_du 18 , e Siecle ( BAM LD 060 ).
   Jean-Marie_LeClair still is remembered a_bit , but Bodin de Beismortier , Corrette and Mondonville are hardly household words.
   What is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal the aspect of French music that was moving toward the rococo.
     The Couperin  La_Steinkerque  , with its battle music , brevity , wit and refined simplicity , already shakes_off Corelli and points towards the mid-century elegances that ended the baroque era.
   If Couperin shows the fashionable trend , the others do so all the more.
     All these records have close , attractive sound and the performances by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic.
     Rameau 's Six Concerts en Sextuor , recorded by L ' orchestre de chambre Pierre_Menet ( BAM LD 046 ) , turn_out to be harpsichord pieces arranged for strings apparently by the composer himself.
   The strange , delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes inexplicable titles are still evocative and gracious.
     Maitres_Allemands_des 17 , e et 18 , e Siecles contains music by Pachelbel , Buxtehude , Rosenmueller and Telemann , well performed by the Ensemble_Instrumental_Sylvie_Spycket ( BAM LD 035 ).
     Rococo music - a_lot_of it - was played in Carnegie_Recital_Hall on Saturday night in the first of four concerts being sponsored this season by a new organization known_as Globe_Concert_Arts.
     Works by J._C._Bach , Anton Craft , Joseph_Haydn , Giuseppe_Sammartini , Comenico_Dragonetti and J._G._Janitsch were performed by seven instrumentalists including Anabel_Brieff , flutist , Josef_Marx , oboist , and Robert_Conant , pianist and harpsichordist.
     Since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above_all , it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grown accustomed_to the stress and dissonances of composers from Beethoven to Boulez.
     Thus there was really an excess of eighteenth-century charm as one of these light-weight pieces followed another on Saturday night.
   Each might find a useful place in a varied musical program , but taken together they grew quite tiresome.
     The performances were variable , those of the full ensemble being generally satisfying , some by soloists proving rather trying.
     Ellie_Mao , soprano , and Frederick_Fuller , baritone , presented a program of folksongs entitled  East_Meets_West  in Carnegie_Recital_Hall last night.
   They were accompanied by Anna_Mi_Lee , pianist.
     Selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos and duets in a broad range of languages.
   Songs from China and Japan were reserved exclusively for Miss_Mao , who is a native of China , and those of the_British Isles were sung by Mr._Fuller , who is English by birth.
     This was not a program intended to illustrate authentic folk styles.
   On_the_contrary , Miss_Mao and Mr._Fuller chose many_of their arrangements from the works of composers such_as Mendelssohn , Dvorak , Canteloube , Copland and Britten.
   Thre was , therefore , more musical substance in the concert than might have been the case otherwise.
   The performances were assured , communicative and pleasingly informal.
     What was omitted from  A Neglected_Education  were those essentials known_as  the facts of life .
     Chabrier 's little one-act operetta , presented yesterday afternoon at Town_Hall , is a fragile , precious little piece , very French , not without wit and charm.
   The poor uneducated newlywed , a certain Gontran de Boismassif , has his problems in getting the necessary information.
   The humor of the situation can be imagined.
     It all takes_place in the eighteenth century.
   What a silly , artificial way_of_life , Chabrier and his librettists chuckle.
   But they wish they could bring it back.
     Chabrier 's delightful music stands just at the point where the classical , rationalist tradition , ( handed_down to Chabrier largely in the form of operetta and salon music ) becomes virtually neo-classicism.
   The musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense_of_taste and measure save a wry little joke from becoming either bawdy or mawkish.
     The simple , clever production was also able to tread the thin line between those extremes.
   Arlene_Saunders was charming as poor Gontran.
   Yes , Arlene is her name ; the work uses the old eighteenth-century tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced youth to a soprano.
   Benita_Valente was delightful as the young wife and John_Parella was amusing as the tutor who failed to do all his tutoring.
     The work was presented as the final event in the Town_Hall Festival of Music.
   It was paired with a Darius_Milhaud opera ,  The Poor_Sailor  , set_to a libretto by Jean_Cocteau , a kind_of Grand_Guignol by the sea , a sailor returns , unrecognized , and gets done_in by his wife.
     With the exception of a_few spots , Milhaud 's music mostly churns away with his usual collection of ditties , odd harmonies , and lumbering , satiric orchestration.
    
    Had a funny experience at Newport yesterday afternoon.
   Sat there and as a woman sang , she kept getting thinner and thinner , right before my eyes , and the eyes of some 5500 other people.
     I make this observation about the lady , Miss_Judy_Garland , because she brought_up the subject herself in telling a story about a British female reporter who flattered her terribly in London recently and_then wrote in the paper the next day :      Judy_Garland has arrived in London.
   She 's not chubby.
   She 's not plump.
   She 's fat .
     But who cares , when the lady sings?
   Certainly not the largest afternoon audience Newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the_most attentive and quiet.
   They applauded every number , not_only at its conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme - sometimes at the first chord.
     And Judy sang the lovely old familiar things which seemed , at_times , a blessed relief from the way-out compositions of the progressive jazzmen who have dominated these proceedings.
   Things like  When_You're_Smiling  ,  Almost_Like_Being_In_Love  ,  Do_It_Again  ,  Born_to_Wander  ,  Alone Together  ,  Who_Cares?
    ,  Puttin ' on the Ritz  ,  How_Long_Has_This_Been_Going_On?
  and her own personal songs like  The_Man_That_Got_Away  , and the inevitable  Over the Rainbow .
     Miss_Garland is not_only one of the great singers of our time but she is one of the superb showmen.
   At_the_start of her program there were evidences of pique.
   She had held to the letter of her contract and did n't come onto the stage until well after 4 p. m. , the appointed hour , although the Music at Newport people had tried to get the program underway at 3.
   Then there was a bad delay in getting Mort_Lindsey 's 30 - piece orchestra wedged into its chairs.
     Along about 4 : 30 , just when it was getting_to be about time to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side , Judy came_on singing , in a short-skirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket that flapped in the wind.
   Her bouffant coiffure was fortunately combed on_the_left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk breeze was blowing.
     In her first song she waved away one encroaching photographer who dared approach the throne unbidden and thereafter the boys with the cameras had_to unsheathe their 300 mm. lenses and shoot at extreme range.
     There also came a brief contretemps with the sound mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during a quiet moment near the conclusion of  Do_It_Again  , and she made the tart observation that  I never saw so_much moving about in an audience .
     But it did n't take Judy_Garland , showman , long to realize that this sort_of thing was par for the course at Newport and that you have_to learn to live with_it.
   Before her chore was finished she was rescuing wind-blown sheets of music , trundling microphones about the stage , helping to move the piano and otherwise joining in the informal atmosphere.
     And time after time she really belted_out her songs.
   Sometimes they struck me as horribly over-arranged - which was the way I felt about her  Come_Rain_or_Come_Shine  - and sometimes they were just plain magnificent , like her shatteringly beautiful  Beautiful Weather .
     To her partisan audience , such picayune haggling would have seemed nothing more_than a critic striving to hold his franchise ; they just sat_back on their haunches and cried for more , as though they could never get enough.
     They were rewarded with splendid , exciting , singing.
   Her  Rockabye Your Baby  was as_good_as it can be done , and her really personal songs , like  The_Man_That_Got_Away  were deeply moving.
     The audience would n't let her leave until it had heard  Over The Rainbow  - although the fellow that kept crying for  Get_Happy  had_to go_home unhappy , about that item anyway.
   She was generous with her encores and the audience was equally so with its cheers and applause and flowers.
     All went_home happy except the Newport police , who feared that the throng departing at 6 : 35 might meet head-on the night crowd drawing nigh , and those deprived_of their happy_hour at the cocktail bar.
     In Newport last night there were flashes of distant lightning in the northern skies.
   This was perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the evening - flashes in the distance , but no storm.
     Several_times it came_near breaking , and there were in_fact some lovely peals of thunder from Jerry_Mulligan 's big_band , which is about as fine an aggregation as has come_along in the jazz business since John_Hammond found Count_Basie working in a Kansas_City trap.
     Mulligan 's band has been infected with his solid sense of swing , and what it does seems far more meaningful than most_of the noise generated by the big concert aggregations.
     But what is equally impressive is the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and Mulligan 's baritone sax in a fragile ballad like Bob_Brookmeyer 's arrangement of  Django 's Castle .
     For subtle swinging rhythms , I could admire intensely Mulligan 's version of  Weep  , and the fireworks went on display in  18 Carrots for Robert  , a sax tribute to Johnny_Hodges.
     There was considerable contrast between this Mulligan performance and that of Art_Blakey and The Jazz Messengers , who are able_to generate a tremendous sound for such a small group.
   Unfortunately , Blakey does n't choose to work much of the time in_this vein.
   He prefers to have his soloist performing and thus we get only brief glimpses of_what his ensemble work is like.
     What we did get , however , was impressive.
     A_few drops of rain just before midnight , when Sarah_Vaughan was in_the_midst of her first number , scattered the more timid members of the audience briefly , but at this hour and with Sarah on the stand , most_of the listeners did n't care whether they got wet.
     Miss_Vaughan was back in top form , somehow mellowed and improved with the passage of time - like a fine wine.
   After the spate of female vocalists we have been having , all_of whom took Sarah as a point of departure and_then tried to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat , it seemed that all that has happened is to make the real_thing seem better than ever.
     The evening program was opened by the Jazz Three , a Newport group consisting_of Steve_Budieshein on bass , Jack_Warner , drums , and Don_Cook , piano.
   This was a continuation of a good idea which was first tried_out Saturday night when the Eddie_Stack group , also local talent , went on first.
     Putting_on local musicians at_this_place in the program serves a triple purpose : it saves the top flight jazz men from being wasted in_this unenviable spot , when the audience is cold , restless , and in flux ; it prevents late-comers from missing some of the people they have come a long way to hear , and it gives the resident musicians a chance to perform before the famous Newport audience.
     The Jazz Three displayed their sound musicianship , not_only in their own chosen set , but as the emergency accompanists for Al_Minns + Leon_James , the superb jazz dancers who have now been Newport performers for three successive years , gradually moving_up from a morning seminar on the evolution of the_blues to a spot on the evening program.
     Julie_Wilson , a vigorous vocalist without many wild twists , sang a set , a large part of_which consisted_of such seldom heard old oldies as  Hard-Hearted_Hannah , the Vamp of Savannah  , and the delightful  Sunday .
   She frosted the cake with the always reliable  Bill_Bailey .
     From this taste of the 1920 s , we leaped way_out to Stan_Getz 's private brand of progressive jazz , which did lovely , subtle things for  Baubles , Bangles and Beads  , and a_couple_of ballards.
     Getz is a difficult musician to categorize.
   He plays his sax principally for beauty of tone , rather_than for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations , and he has a quiet way of getting_back and restating the melody after the improvising is over.
   In_this he is sticking_with tradition , however far removed from_it he may seem to be.
     George_Shearing took_over with his well disciplined group , a sextet consisting_of vibes , guitar , bass , drums , Shearing 's piano and a bongo drummer.
   He met with enthusiastic audience approval , especially when he swung from jazz to Latin_American things like the Mambo.
   Shearing , himself , seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent Newport appearances.
     A very casual , pleasant program - one of those easy-going things that make Newport 's afternoon programs such a relaxing delight - was held again under sunny skies , hot sun , and a fresh_breeze for an audience of at_least a_couple_of thousands who came to Newport to hear music rather_than go to the beach.
     Divided almost equally into two parts , it consisted_of  The Evolution of the_Blues  , narrated by Jon_Hendricks , who had presented it last year at the Monterey , Calif. , Jazz_Festival , and an hour-long session of Maynard_Ferguson and his orchestra , a blasting big_band.
     Hendricks ' story was designed for children and he had a small audience of small children right_on stage with him.
   Tracing the_blues from its African roots among the slaves who were brought to this country and the West_Indies , he stressed the close relationship between the early jazz forms and the music of the Negro churches.
     To help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz he had  Big  Miller , as a preacher-singer and Hannah_Dean , Gospel-singer , while Oscar_Brown_Jr. , an extremely talented young_man , did a slave auctioneer 's call , a field-hands ' work_song , and a beautifully sung Negro lullaby ,  Brown_Baby  , which was one of the truly moving moments of the festival.
     One of those delightful surprise additions , which so frequently occur in jazz programs , was an excellent stint at the drums by the great Joe_Jones , drumming to  Old_Man River  , which seems to have been elected the favorite solo for the boys on the batterie at this year 's concerts.
     Demonstrating the primitive African rhythmic backgrounds of the_Blues was Michael_Babatunde_Olatunji , who plays such native drums as the konga and even does a resounding job slapping his own chest.
   He has been on previous Newport programs and was one of the sensations of last year 's afternoon concerts.
     Hendricks had Billy_Mitchell , tenor sax ; Pony_Poindexter , alto sax ; Jimmy_Witherspoon , blues singer ( and a good one ) , and the Ike_Isaacs_Trio , which has done such wonderful work for two afternoons now , helping him with the musical examples.
     It all went very_well.
     Pianists who are serious about their work are likely to know the interesting material contained in Schubert 's Sonatas.
   Music_lovers who are not familiar_with this literature may hear an excellent example , played for RCA by Emil_Gilels.
   He has chosen Sonata_Op. 53 in D.
   The playing takes both sides of the disc.
   Perhaps one of the reasons these Sonatas are not programmed more_often is their great length.
   Rhythmic interest , melodic beauty and the expansiveness of the writing are all qualities which hold one 's attention with the Gilels playing.
   His technique is ample and his musical ideas are projected beautifully.
     The male chorus of the Robert_Shaw_Chorale sings Sea Shanties in fine style.
   The group is superbly trained.
   What a discussion can ensue when the title of_this type of song is in_question.
   Do you say chantey , as if the word were derived from the_French word chanter , to sing , or do you say shanty and think_of a roughly built cabin , which derives its name from the French-Canadian use of the word chantier , with one of its meanings given as a boat-yard?
   I say chantey.
   Either way , the Robert_Shaw chorus sings them in fine style with every colorful word and its musical frame spelled_out in_terms_of agreeable listening.
   If your favorite song is not here it must be an unfamiliar one.
     The London label offers an operatic recital by Ettore_Bastianini , a baritone whose fame is international.
    
    Murray_Louis and his dance company appeared at the Henry_Street_Playhouse on Friday and Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons in the premiere of his latest work ,  Signal  , and the repetition of an earlier one ,  Journal .
      Signal  is choreographed for three male dancers to an electronic score by Alwin_Nikolais.
   Its abstract decor is by John_Hultberg.
   Program note reads as_follows :      Take hands , this urgent visage beckons us .
     Here , as in  Journal  , Mr._Louis has given himself the lion 's share of the dancing , and there is no_doubt that he is capable_of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting physical movements.
   Indeed , both  Journal  and  Signal  qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics.
     But chains of movements are not necessarily communicative , and it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing.
   One frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations could be transposed without notable loss of effect , there is too little suggestion of organic relationship and development.
     It may be , of_course , that Mr._Louis is consciously trying to create works that anticipate an age of total automation.
   But it may be , also , that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at_the_present_time.
   One thing is certain , however , and that is that he is far more slavish to the detailed accents , phrasings and contours of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be.
     A brisk , satirical spoof of contemporary American mores entitled  An American_Journey  was given its first New_York performance at Hunter_College_Playhouse last night by the Helen_Tamiris-Daniel_Nagrin_Dance_Company.
   Choreographed by Mr._Nagrin , the work filled the second_half of a program that also offered the first New_York showing of Miss_Tamiris '  Once Upon a Time  , as_well as her  Women 's Song  and Mr._Nagrin 's  Indeterminate Figure .
     Eugene_Lester assembled a witty and explicit score for  An American_Journey  , and Malcolm_McCormick gave it sprightly imaginative costumes.
     Mr._Nagrin has described four  places  , each with its scenery and people , added two  diversions  , and concluded with  A Toccata for the Young  , a refreshingly underplayed interpretation of rock ' n ' roll dancing.
     The  places  could be anywhere , the idiosyncrasies and foibles observed there could be anybody 's , and the laugh is on us all.
   But we need not mind too_much , because Mr._Nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever almost all_the_way.
     Miss_Tamiris '  Once Upon a Time  is a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three  figures  that bother them somehow.
     Unfortunately , the man and woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the menacing figures failed to make them any_more so.
   Nor did the dancing involved really seize the attention at_any_time.
   The music here , Russell_Smith 's  Tetrameron  , sounded good.
     All the performances of the evening were smooth and assured , and the sizable company , with Mr._Nagrin and Marion_Scott as its leading dancers , seemed to be fine shape.
     The Symphony of the Air , greatly assisted by Van_Cliburn , last night got its seven-concert Beethoven cycle at Carnegie_Hall off to a good start.
   At_the_same_time the orchestra announced that next season it would be giving twenty-five programs at Carnegie , and that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs , repeating each of them in five different communities.
     This news , announced by Jerome_Toobin , the orchestra 's administrative director , brought applause from the 2800 persons who filled the hall.
   They showed they were glad that Carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there so often next season to take_up the slack with the departure to Lincoln_Center of the New_York Philharmonic , the Philadelphia_Orchestra and the Boston_Symphony.
     This season the orchestra has already taken a step toward the suburbs in_that it is giving six subscription concerts for the Orchestral_Society of Westchester in the County_Center in White_Plains.
   The details of the suburban concerts next season , and the centers in_which they will be given , will be announced later , Mr._Toobin said.
     The concertos that Van_Cliburn has been associated with in New_York since his triumphant return from Russia in 1958 have been the Tchaikovsky , the Rachmaninoff_Third , and the Prokofieff_Third.
   It was pleasant last night , therefore , to hear him do something else : a concerto he has recently recorded ,  The Emperor .
     The young Texas pianist can make great chords ring_out as_well as anyone , so last night the massive sonorities of_this challenging concerto were no hazard to him.
   But they were not what distinguished his performance.
   The elements that did were the introspective slow movement , the beautiful transition to the third movement , and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger moments of the opening movement and the final Rondo.
     Mr._Cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a Chopin_Nocturne.
   Alfred_Wallenstein , the conductor , sensitive accompanist that he is , picked_up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of broodinf , poetic mystery.
   The collaboration was remarkable , as it was in both the other movements , too.
     Mr._Wallenstein , who will lead all_of the concerts in the cycle , also conducted the  Leonore  Overture No. 3 and the Fourth_Symphony.
   The orchestra was obviously on its mettle and it played most responsively.
   And although there was plenty of vigor in the performance , the ensemble was at its best when the playing was soft and lyrical , yet full_of the suppressed tension that is one of the hallmarks of Beethoven.
   Igor_Oistrakh will be the next soloist on Feb. 4.
     There are times when one suspects that the songs that are dropped from musical shows before they reach Broadway may really be better than many_of those that are_left in.
   Today , in the era of the integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all development of the show , it is understandable that a song , no_matter_how excellent it may be on its own terms , is cut_out because it does not perform the function required of_it.
     In the more casually constructed musicals of the Nineteen Twenties and Nineteen Thirties there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song of merit.
   Yet there is the classic case of the Gershwins '  The_Man_I_Love .
   Deemed too static when it was first heard in  Lady Be Good  in Philadelphia in 1924 , it was dropped from the score.
   It was heard again in Philadelphia in 1927 in the first version of  Strike_Up the Band  and again abandoned shortly before the entire show was given_up.
   It finally reached Broadway in the second and successful version of  Strike_Up the Band  in 1929.
   ( Still another song in  Strike_Up the Band  -  I 've_Got_a_Crush_on_You  - was retrieved from a 1928 failure ,  Treasure_Girl  ).
     Like the Gershwins , Richard_Rodgers and Lorenz_Hart were loath to let a good song get_away from them.
   If one of Mr._Rodgers ' melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than interment in Boston or the obscurity of a Broadway failure , Mr._Hart was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance in another show.
     Several of these double_entries have been collected by Ben_Bagley and Michael_McWhinney , along with Rodgers and Hart songs that disappeared permanently en_route to New_York and_others that reached Broadway but have not become part of the constantly heard Rodgers and Hart repertory , in a delightfully refreshing album , Rodgers and Hart_Revisited ( Spruce Records , 505 Fifth_Avenue , New_York ).
     Among the particular gems in_this collection is the impudent opening song of  The Garrick Gaieties  , an impressive forecast of the wit and melody that were to come from Rodgers and Hart in the years that followed ; Dorothy_Loudon 's raucous listing of the attractions  At the Roxy Music_Hall  from  I Married an Angel  ; and the incisive style with which Charlotte_Rae delivers the top-drawer Hart lyrics of  I Blush  , a song that was cut from  A Connecticut_Yankee .
     Altogether fifteen virtually unknown Rodgers and Hart songs are sung by a quintet of able vocalists.
     Norman_Paris has provided them with extremely effective orchestral accompaniment Turning_to the current musical season on Broadway , the_most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals , How_to_Succeed_in_Business_Without_Really_Trying , has been transferred to an original cast album ( R._C._A._Victor_LOC 1066 ; stereo LSO 1066 ) that has some entertaining moments , although it is scarcely as inventive as the praise elicited by the show might lead one to expect.
   Robert_Morse , singing with comically plaintive earnestness , carries most_of the burden and is responsible_for the high spots in Frank_Loesser 's score.
     Rudy_Vallee , who shares star billing with Mr._Morse , makes only two appearances.
   He shares with Mr._Morse a parody of the college anthems he once sang while his second song is whisked_away from him by Virginia_Martin , a girl with a remarkably expressive yip in her voice.
   In_general , Mr._Loesser has done a more consistent job as lyricist than he has as composer.
     Like Mr._Loesser , Jerry_Herman is both composer and lyriist for Milk and Honey ( R._C._A._Victor_LOC 1065 ; stereo LSO 1065 ) , but in_this case it is the music that stands above the lyrics.
   For this story of an American couple who meet and fall_in_love in Israel , Mr._Herman has written songs that are warmly melodious and dance_music that sparkles.
     There are the full-bodied , resourceful voices of Robert_Weede , Mimi_Benzell and Tommy_Rall to make the most of Mr._Herman 's lilting melodies and , for an occasional change of pace , the bright humor of Molly_Picon.
   Mr._Herman has managed to mix musical ideas drawn from Israel and the standard American ballad style in a manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both idioms.
     Not content to create only the music and lyrics , Noe ^ l Coward also wrote the book and directed Sail Away ( Capitol_WAO 1643 ; stereo SWAO 1643 ) , a saga of life on a cruise_ship that is not apt to be included among Mr._Coward 's more memorable works.
   The melodies flow along pleasantly , as Mr._Coward 's songs usually do , but his lyrics have a tired , cut-to-a-familiar-pattern quality.
   Elaine_Stritch , who sings with a persuasively warm huskiness , belts some life into most_of her songs , but the other members of the cast sound as lukewarm as Mr._Coward 's songs.
     With three fine Russian films in recent months on World_War 2 , -  The_House_I_Live_In  ,  The_Cranes_Are_Flying  and  Ballad of a Soldier  - we had every right to expect a real Soviet block-buster in  The Day the War_Ended .
   It simply is n't , not_by_a_long_shot.
   The Artkino presentation , with English titles , opened on Saturday at the Cameo_Theatre.
     Make no mistake , this Gorky_Studio drama is a respectable import - aptly grave , carefully written , performed and directed.
   In describing the initial Allied occupation of a middle-sized German city , the picture has color , pictorial pull and genuinely moving moments.
   Told strictly from the viewpoint of the Russian conquerors , the film compassionately peers over the shoulders of a smitten Soviet couple , at both sides of the conflict 's aftermath.
     Unfortunately , the whole picture hinges_on this romance , at the expense of everything else.
   Tenderly and rather tediously , the camera rivets on the abrupt , deep love of a pretty nurse and a uniformed teacher , complicated by nothing more_than a friend they do n't want to hurt.
   It 's the old story , war or no war , and more_than one viewer may recall Hollywood 's  Titanic  , several seasons back , when the paramount concern was for the marital discord of a society dilettante.
     Not that the picture is superficial.
   Under Yakov_Segal 's direction , it begins stirringly , as crouching Soviet and Nazi troops silently scan each other , waiting for the first surrender gesture.
   One high-up camera shot is magnificent , as the Germans straggle from a cathedral , dotting a huge , cobblestone square , and drop their weapons.
    
    Only once in a very long while comes a book that gives the reader a magic sense of sharing a rare experience.
    Ring of Bright_Water  by Gavin_Maxwell is just that - a haunting , warmly personal chronicle of a man , an otter , and a remote cottage in the Scottish_West_Highlands.
      He has married me with a ring of bright water  , begins the Kathleen_Raine poem from which Maxwell takes his title , and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the author conveys.
   The place is Camusfearna , the site of a long-vanished sea-village opposite the isle of Skye.
   It is a land of long fjords , few people , a single-lane road miles away - and of wild stags , Greylag_geese , wild swans , dolphins and porpoises playing in the waters.
   How Maxwell recounts his first coming to Camusfearna , his furnishing the empty house with beach-drift , the subtle changes in season over ten years , is a moving experience.
   Just the evocations of time and place , of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today seems almost lost , would be enough.
     But it is n't.
   There is Mijbil , an otter who travelled with Maxwell - and gave Maxwell 's name to a new species - from the Tigris marshes to his London flat.
   It may sound extravagant to say that there has never been a more engaging animal in_all literature.
   This is not_only a compliment to Mijbil , of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings in the book , but to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened otter cub 's journey by plane from Iraq to London , then by train ( where he lay curled in the wash basin playing with the water tap ) to Camusfearna , with affectionate detail.
     Mij , as his owner was soon to learn , had strange , inexplicable habits.
   He liked to nip ear lobes of unsuspecting visitors with his needle-sharp teeth.
   He preferred sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow.
   Systematically he would open and ransack drawers.
   Given a small ball or marbles , he would invent games and play by himself for hours.
   With curiosity and elan , he explored every_inch of glen , beach and burn , once stranding himself for hours on a ledge high_up a sheer seventy-foot cliff and waiting with calm faith to be rescued by Maxwell , who nearly lost his life in doing so.
     A year and a day of_this idyll is described for the reader , one in_which not_only discovery of a new_world of personality is charted , but self-discovery as_well.
   In the solitude of Camusfearna there had been no loneliness.
    To be quite alone where there are no other human_beings is sharply exhilarating ; it is as though some pressure had suddenly been_lifted , allowing an intense awareness & & & a sharpening of the senses .
     Now , with the increasing interdependence between himself and Mij came a knowledge of an obscure need , that of being trusted implicitly by some creature.
   Two other people in_time shared Mijbil 's love :  it remained around us three that his orb revolved when he was not away in his own imponderable world of wave and water ; we were his Trinity , and he behaved towards us with a mixture of trust and abuse , passion and irritation.
   In_turn each of us in our own way depended , as gods do , upon his worship .
     Yet the idyll ended.
   The brief details of Mijbil 's death lend depth to the story , give it an edge of ironic tragedy.
   Man , to whom Mij gave endless affection and fealty , was responsible in the form of a road worker with a pickaxe who somehow becomes an abstract symbol of the savage in man.
   But then , through a strange coincidence , Maxwell manages to acquire Idal , a female otter , and the fascinating story starts once_more.
     One is not sure who emerges as the main personality of_this book - Mijbil , with his rollicking ways , or Maxwell himself , poet , portrait_painter , writer , journalist , traveller and zoologist , sensitive but never sentimental recorder of an unusual way_of_life , in a language at_once lyrical and forceful , vivid and unabashed.
   This reviewer read the book when it was first brought_out in England with a sense of discovery and excitement.
   Now Gavin_Maxwell 's ring of bright water has widened to enchant the world.
     The performances of the Comedie_Francaise are the_most important recent events in the New_York theater.
     They serve to contradict a popular notion that the Comedie merely repeats , as accurately as possible , the techniques of acting the classics that prevailed in the 17 th century.
   On_the_contrary , the old plays are continually being reinterpreted , and each new production of a classic has only a brief history at the Comedie.
     Of_course , the well-received revivals last longer than the others , and that further reminds us that the Comedie is not insensitive to criticism.
   The directors of the Comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient a manner as the Broadway producers who , in two instances this season , closed their plays after one performance.
   But they are aware_of the world outside , they court public approval , they delight in full houses , and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpreting a dramatic classic.
     In France , novel approaches to the classic French plays are frequently attempted.
   The government pays a subsidy for revival of the classics , and this policy attracts experimenters who sometimes put Moliere 's characters in modern dress and often achieve interesting results.
     So_far as I know , the Comedie has never put Moliere 's people in the costumes of the 20 th century , but they do reinterpret plays and characters.
   Last season , the Comedie 's two principal experiments came to grief , and , in consequence , we can expect fairly soon to see still newer productions of Racine 's  Phedre  and Moliere 's  School for Wives .
     The new  Phedre  was done in 17 th century setting , instead of ancient_Greek ; perhaps that is the Comedie 's equivalent for thrusting this play 's characters into our own time.
   The speaking of the lines seemed excessively slow and stately , possibly in an effort to capture the spirit of 17 th century elegance.
   A_few literary men defended what they took_to_be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama , but the response was mainly hostile and quite violent.
     The new  School for Wives  was interpreted according to a principle that_is becoming increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy - the idea of turning some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character.
     Among the Moliere specialists of some years ago , Louis_Jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns , while Fernand_Ledoux , often performing at the Comedie , made them more gross than Moliere may have intended.
     Apparently , Jouvet and Ledoux attempted just these dissimilar approaches in the role of Arnolphe in  The School for Wives .
   I say  apparently  although I saw Jouvet as Arnolphe when he visited this country shortly before his death ; by that time , he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments of the comedy.
     Arnolphe , it will be recalled , is a man of mature years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful wife-to-be.
   The part can lend itself to serious treatment ; one influential French critic remarked :  Pity for Arnolphe comes_with age .
     Accordingly , at the Comedie last year , Jean_Meyer played a sympathetic Arnolphe and drew criticism for turning the comedy into a tragedy.
   But the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the play became only comedy acted rather slowly.
     Wisely , the Comedie has brought Moliere 's  Tartuffe  on its tour and has_left  The School for Wives  at_home.
   Tartuffe is the religious hypocrite who courts his benefactor 's wife.
   Jouvet played him as a sincere zealot , and Ledoux , at the Comedie , made him a gross buffoon , or_so the historians tell us.
     Louis_Seigner , who formerly played the deluded benefactor opposite Ledoux , is the Tartuffe of the present production , which he himself directed.
   His Tartuffe observes the golden_mean.
   His red face , his coarse gestures , and his lustful stares bespeak his sensuality.
   But his heavenward glances and his pious speeches are not merely perfunctory ; of_course , they do not reflect sincerity , but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his pious impersonation.
     Occasionally , Seigner draws some justly deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another.
   The whole role , by_the_way , is a considerable transformation for anyone who has seen Seigner in his other parts.
   His normal specialty is playing the good-natured old_man , frequently stupid or deluded but never mean or sly.
   Here , he is , quite persuasively , the very embodiment of meanness and slyness.
     Seigner is the dean of the company , the oldest actor in point of continuous service.
   In_that function , he helps to rebut another legend about the Comedie.
   We are often told that the Comedie has , unfortunately , life-contracts with old actors who are both mediocre and lazy , drawing their pay without much acting but probably doing real service to the Comedie by staying off_the_stage.
   Seigner , however , is a fine actor and probably the busiest man in the company ; among his other parts are the leads in  The Bourgeois Gentleman  and  The Imaginary_Invalid .
     In Moliere 's farce ,  The Tricks of Scapin  , Robert_Hirsch undertakes another of the great roles.
   Here some innovation is attempted.
     To_begin_with , Scapin is a trickster in the old tradition of the clever servant who plots the strategy of courtship for his master.
   Hirsch 's Scapin is healthy , cheerful , energetic , revelling in his physical agility and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen whom he serves.
     Hirsch says that he has given the role certain qualities he has observed in the city toughs of the real_world.
   And surely his Scapin has a fresh directness , a no-nonsense quality that seems to make him his own master and nobody 's servant.
     Django_Reinhardt , the ill-fated gypsy , was a true artist , one who demonstrated conclusively the power of art to renew itself and flow into many channels.
     There is hardly_a jazz guitarist in the business today who does n't owe something to Django.
   And Django owed much to Louis_Armstrong.
   He told once of how he switched his style of playing to jazz after listening to two old Armstrong records he bought in the Flea_Market in Paris.
   It was the first jazz he had heard.
     Django , who was_born Jean_Baptiste_Reinhardt in Belgium and who died in 1953 in France , was an extraordinary man.
   Most_of the fingers on his left_hand were burned_off when he fell_asleep with a cigarette.
   And this was before he began to play his startlingly beautiful jazz.
     You can catch_up_with him - if you have n't already - on RCA-Victor 's album.
    Djangology  , made_up of tracks he recorded with Stephane_Grappelly and the Quintet of the Hot_Club of France.
   This is a choice item and Grappely deserves mention too , of_course.
   He is one of the few men in history who plays jazz on a violin.
     They play :  Minor_Swing  ,  Honeysuckle_Rose  ,  Beyond_the_Sea  ,  Bricktop  ,  Heavy Artillery  ,  Djangology  ,  After You 've Gone  ,  Where Are You , My Love ?
    I Saw Stars  ,  Lover Man  ,  Menilmontant  and  Swing 42 .
     All this is great proceedings - get the minutes.
     Kid_Ory , the trombonist chicken farmer , is also one of the solid anchor points of jazz.
   He dates_back to the days before the first sailing_ship pulled into New_Orleans.
   His horn has blown loud and clear across the land for more years than he cares to remember.
     Good Time_Jazz has released a nice two-record album which he made.
   He is starred against Alvin_Alcorn , trumpet ; Phil_Gomez , clarinet ; Cedric_Haywood , piano ; Julian_Davidson , guitar ; Wellman_Braud , bass , and Minor_Hall , drums.
     The set contains  High_Society  ,  Do What Ory Say  ,  Down Home_Rag  ,  Careless_Love  , Jazz Me Blues  ,  Weary Blues  ,  Original_Dixieland_One-Step  ,  Bourbon_Street_Parade  ,  Panama  ,  Toot , Toot , Tootsie  ,  Oh Did n't He Ramble  ,  Beale_Street Blues  ,  Maryland , My Maryland  ,  1919 Rag  ,  Eh , La_Bas  ,  Mood_Indigo  , and  Bugle_Call Rag .
     All this will serve to show_off the Ory style in fine fashion and is a must for those who want to collect elements of the old-time jazz before it is too late to lay_hands_on the gems.
    
    Mischa_Elman shared last night 's Lewisohn_Stadium concert with three American composers.
     His portion of the program - and a big portion it was - consisted_of half the major nineteenth-century concertos for the violin : to wit , the Mendelssohn and the Tchaikovsky.
   That is an evening of music-making that would faze many_a younger man ; Mr._Elman is 70 years old.
     There were 8000 persons at the Stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they heard Elman.
   But , with all due respects and allowances , it must truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet , more mannered than musical.
   The occasion was sentimental ; so was the playing.
     The American part of the evening consisted_of Paul_Creston 's Dance_Overture , William_Schuman 's  Chester  from  New_England Triptych  and two works of Wallingford_Riegger , Dance Rhythms , Op. 58 , and a Romanza for Strings , Op. 56 A.
     The Creston is purely a potboiler , with Spanish , English , French and American dances mixed into the stew.
   The Riegger , with its Latin hesitation bounce , is just this side of the pale ; like his sweet , attractive Romanza , it belongs to what the composer called his  Non-Dissonant ( Mostly )  category of works.
   The Schuman  Chester  takes_off from an old William Billings tune with rousing woodwind and brass effect.
     All these - potboilers or no - provided a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively , colorful , unstuffy works well suited for the great out-of-doors.
   It was nice to have something a_little up-to-date for a change.
   We have Alfredo_Antonini to thank for this healthy change of diet as_well as the lively performances of the Stadium_Symphony.
     A woman who undergoes artificial_insemination against the wishes of her husband is the unlikely heroine of  A Question of Adultery  , yesterday 's new British import at the Apollo.
     Since an objective viewer might well conclude that this is not a situation that would often arise , the film 's extensive discussion of the problem seems , at_best , superfluous.
   In its present artless , low-budget form , the subject_matter seems designed to invite censorial wrath.
     With Julie_London enacting the central role with husky-voiced sincerity , the longsuffering heroine is at_least attractive.
   The explanation offered for her conduct is a misguided attempt to save her marriage to a neurotic husband left sterile as a result of an automobile accident.
     Anthony_Steel , as the husband , is a jealous type who argues against her course and sues for divorce , labeling her action adulterous.
   The actor plays his role glumly under the lurid direction of Don_Chaffey , as do Basil_Sydney as his unsympathetic father and Anton_Diffring as an innocent bystander.
     After a protracted , hysterical trial scene more notable for the frankness of its language than for dramatic credibility , the jury , to no one 's surprise , leaves the legal question unresolved.
   When the husband drops the case and returns to his wife , both seem sorry they brought the_matter up in_the_first_place.
   So was the audience.
     For its final change of bill in its London season , the Leningrad_State_Kirov_Ballet chose tonight to give one of those choreographic miscellanies known as a  gala program  at the Royal Opera_House , Covent_Garden.
   No_doubt the underlying idea was to show that for all the elegance and artistry that have distinguished its presentations thus_far , it too could give a circus if it pleased.
     And please it did , in every sense of the word , for it had the audience shouting much of the time in a manner far from typical of London audiences.
   At the end of the program , indeed , there was a demonstration that lasted for forty-five minutes , and nothing could stop it.
   Alexandre_Livshitz repeated a fantastic technical bit from the closing number ,  Taras_Bulba  , but even then there was a substantial number of diehards who seemed determined not to go_home at_all.
   Only a plea from the house manager , John_Collins , finally broke_up the party.
     But for all the manifest intention to  show_off  , this was a circus with a difference , for instead of descending in quality to what is known as a popular level , it added further to the evidence that this is a very great dancing company.
     The  Taras_Bulba  excerpt is a rousing version of Gogol 's Ukrainian folk-tale choreographed by Bo_Fenster to music of Soloviev-Sedoi.
   It is danced by some thirty-five men and no women , and it contains everything in the books - lusty comedy , gregarious cavorting , and tricks that only madmen or Russians would attempt to make the human_body perform.
   Yuri_Soloviev , Oleg_Sokolov , Alexei_Zhitkov , Lev_Sokolov , Yuri_Korneyev and Mr._Livshitz were the chief soloists , but everybody on stage was magnificent.
     At the other extreme in character was the half-hour excerpt from the Petipa-Minkus ballet  Bayaderka  , which opened the evening.
   What a man this Petipa was!
   And why do we in the West know so few of his ballets?
   This scene is a  white ballet  in_which a lovelorn hero searches for his departed love 's spirit among twenty-eight extraordinarily beautiful  shadows  who can all dance like nothing human - which , of_course , is altogether fitting.
   The ensemble enters in a long adagio passage that is of fantastic difficulty , as_well as loveliness , and adagio is the general medium of the piece.
     Its ballerina , Olga_Moiseyeva , performs simple miracles of beauty , and Ludmilla_Alexeyeva , Inna_Korneyeva and Gabrielle_Komleva make_up a threesome of exquisite accomplishments.
   Sergei_Vikulov , as the lone male , meets the competition well with some brilliant hits , but the work is designed to belong to the ladies.
     The middle section of the program was made_up of short numbers , naturally enough of unequal merit , but all_of them pretty good at that.
   They consisted_of a new arrangement of  Nutcracker  excerpts danced stunningly by Irina_Kolpakova and Mr._Sokolev , with a large ensemble ; a winning little  Snow_Maiden  variation by the adorable Galina_Kekisheva ; two of those poetic adagios in Greek veils ( and superb esthetic acrobacy ) by Alla_Osipenko and Igor_Chernishev in_one_case and Inna_Zubkovskaya and Yuri_Kornevey in the other ; an amusing character pas de cinq called  Gossiping_Women  ; a stirring  Flames of Paris  pas_de_deux by Xenia_Ter-Stepanova and Alexandre_Pavlovsky , and a lovely version of Fokine 's  Le_Cygne  by Olga_Moiseyeva , which had to be repeated.
     Vadim_Kalentiev was the conductor.
     It was quite an evening!
     A year ago today , when the Democrats were fretting and frolicking in Los_Angeles and John_F._Kennedy was still only an able and ambitious Senator who yearned for the power and responsibility of the Presidency , Theodore_H._White had already compiled masses of notes about the Presidential campaign of 1960.
     As the pace of the quadrennial American political festival accelerated , Mr._White took more notes.
   He traveled alternately with Mr._Kennedy and with Richard_M._Nixon.
     He asked intimate questions and got frank answers from the members of_what he calls the candidates '  in-groups .
   He assembled quantities of facts about the nature of American politics in_general , as_well as about the day-to-day course of the closest Presidential election in American history.
     Those of us who read the papers may think we know a good_deal about that election ; how little we know of_what there is to be known is made humiliatingly clear by Mr._White in  The Making of the President 1960 .
     This is a remarkable book and an astonishingly interesting one.
   What might have been only warmed-over topical journalism turns_out to be an eyewitness contribution to history.
   Mr._White , who is only a competent novelist , is a brilliant reporter.
   His zest for specific detail , his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere , his tireless industry and his crisply turned prose all contribute to the effectiveness of his book.
     As a dramatic narrative  The Making of the President 1960  is continuously engrossing.
   And as an introduction to American politics it is highly educational.
     The author begins this volume with a close-up of Mr._Kennedy , his family and his entourage waiting for the returns.
   He then switches back to a consideration of the seven principal Presidential hopefuls : five Democrats - Senator_Hubert_H._Humphrey , Senator_Stuart_Symington , Senator_Lyndon_B._Johnson , Adlai_E._Stevenson and Mr._Kennedy - and two Republicans - Governor_Rockefeller and Mr._Nixon.
     Then , in chronological order , Mr._White covers the primary campaigns , the conventions and the Presidential campaign itself.
   In the process he writes at_length about many related matters : the importance of race , religion , local tradition , bosses , organizations , zealous volunteers and television.
   Mr._White is bluntly frank in his personal opinions.
   He frequently cites intimate details that seem to come straight from the horse 's mouth , from numerous insiders and from Mr._Kennedy himself ; but never from Mr._Nixon , who looked_on reporters with suspicion and distrust.
      Rarely in American history has there been a political_campaign that discussed issues less or clarified them less  , says Mr._White.
   Mr._Nixon , he believes , has no particular political philosophy and mismanaged his own campaign.
   Although a skillful politician and a courageous and honest man , Mr._Nixon , Mr._White believes , ignored his own top-level planners , wasted time and effort in the wrong regions , missed opportunities through indecision and damaged his chances on television.
     Mr._Nixon is  a broody , moody man , given_to long stretches of introspection ; he trusts only himself and his wife.
   He is a man of major talent - but a man of solitary , uncertain impulses.
   He was above_all a friend seeker , almost pathetic in his eagerness to be liked.
   He wanted to identify with people and have a connection with them ; the_least inspiring candidate since Alfred_M._Landon .
     Mr._Kennedy , Mr._White believes ,  had mastered politics on so many different levels that no other American could match him .
   Calm , dignified , composed ,  superbly eloquent  , Mr._Kennedy always knew everything about everybody.
   He enlisted a staff of loyal experts and of many zealous volunteers.
   Every decision was made quickly on sound grounds.
   Efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance.
   Mr._Kennedy did not neglect to cultivate the personal friendship of reporters.
   Mr._White admires him profoundly and leaves no_doubt that he is a Democrat himself who expects Mr._Kennedy to be a fine President.
     Throughout  The_Making_of_a_President  Mr._White shows wonderfully well how the pressures pile_up on candidates , how decisions have constantly to be made , how fatigue and illness and nervous_strain wear candidates down , how subordinates play key roles.
   And he makes many interesting comments.
   Here are several :      The root question in American politics is always :   Who 's the Man to See?
   To understand American politics is , simply , to know people , to know the relative weight of names - who are heroes , who are straw_men , who controls , who does not.
   But to operate in American politics one must go a step further - one must build a bridge to such names , establish a warmth , a personal connection .
      In the hard life of politics it is well known that no platform nor any program advanced by either major American_party has any purpose beyond expressing_emotion .
      All platforms are meaningless : the program of either party is what lies_in the vision and conscience of the candidate the party chooses to lead it .
     Nostalgia Week at Lewisohn_Stadium , which had begun with the appearance of the 70 - year-old Mischa_Elman on Tuesday night , continued last night as Lily_Pons led the list of celebrities in an evening of French operatic excerpts.
     Miss_Pons is certainly not 70 - no singer ever is - and yet the rewards of the evening again lay more in paying tribute to a great figure of times gone_by than in present accomplishments.
   The better part of gallantry might be , perhaps , to honor her perennial good_looks and her gorgeous rainbow-hued gown , and to chide the orchestra for not playing in the same keys in_which she had chosen to sing.
     No orchestra , however , could be expected to follow a singer through quite as_many adventures with pitch as Miss_Pons encountered last night.
   In_all fairness , there were flashes of the great stylist of yesteryear , flashes even of the old consummate vocalism.
     One such moment came in the breathtaking way Miss_Pons sang the cadenza to Meyerbeer 's  Shadow_Song .
   The years suddenly fell_away at this point.
   On_the_whole , however , one must wonder at just what it is that forces a beloved artist to besmirch her own reputation as time marches inexorably on.
     Sharing the program was the young French-Canadian tenor Richard_Verreau , making his stadium debut on this occasion.
   Mr._Verreau began shakily , with a voice that tended toward an unpleasant whiteness when pushed beyond middle volume.
   Later_on this problem vanished , and the  Flower_Song  from Bizet 's  Carmen  was beautifully and intelligently projected.
    
    Radio is easily outdistancing television in its strides to reach the minority listener.
   Lower costs and a larger number of stations are the key factors making such specialization possible.
     The mushrooming of FM outlets , offering concerts ( both jazz and classical ) , lectures , and other special events , is a phenomenon which has had a fair amount of publicity.
     Not so well_known is the growth of broadcasting operations aimed wholly or partly at Negro listeners - an audience which , in the United_States , comprises some 19000000 people with $ 20000000000 to spend each_year.
     Of_course , the nonwhite listener does his share of television watching.
   He even buys a_lot_of the products he sees advertised - despite_the_fact_that the copy makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely use any but white models in commercials.
     But the growing number of Negro-appeal radio_stations , plus evidence of strong listener support of their advertisers , give time salesmen an impressive argument as they approach new prospects.
   It is estimated that more_than 600 stations ( of a total of 3400 ) do a significant amount of programing for the Negro.
   At_least 60 stations devote all_of their time to reaching this audience in about half of the 50 states.
     These and other figures and comments have been reported in a special supplement of Sponsor magazine , a trade publication for radio and TV advertisers.
   For 10 years Sponsor has issued an annual survey of the size and characteristics of the Negro market and of successful techniques for reaching this market through radio.
     In_the_past 10 years , Sponsor observes , these trends have become apparent :     Negro population in the U._S. has increased 25 per_cent while the white population was growing by 18 per_cent.
    The forgotten 15 million  - as Sponsor tagged the Negro market in its first survey - has become a better-remembered 19 million.
     Advertisers are changing their attitudes , both as to the significance of_this market and the ways of speaking_to it.
     Stations programing to Negro listeners are having to upgrade their shows in_order_to keep pace with rising educational , economic , and cultural levels.
   Futhermore , the station which wants real prestige must lead or participate in community improvement projects , not simply serve on the air.
     In the last decade the number of Negro-appeal radio program hours has risen at_least 15 per_cent , and the number of Negro-appeal stations has increased 30 per_cent , according to a research man quoted by Sponsor.
     A year ago the Negro_Radio_Association was formed to spur research which the 30 - odd member stations are sure will bring_in more business.
     The 1960 census underscored the explosive character of the population growth.
   It also brought_home proof of something a casual observer might have missed : that more_than half of the U._S. Negroes live outside the southeastern states.
   Also , the state with the largest number of Negroes is New_York - not in the South at_all.
     In New_York_City , WLIB boasts  more community service_programs than any other Negro station  and  one of the largest Negro news staffs in America .
   And WWRL 's colorful mobile unit , cruising predominately Negro neighborhoods , is a frequent reminder of_that station 's round-the-clock dedication to nonwhite interests.
   Recently , WWRL won praise for its expose of particular cases of employment_agency deceit.
   A half-dozen other stations in the New_York area also bid for attention of the city 's Negro population , up about 50 per_cent in_the_past decade.
     In_all big cities outside the South , and even in small_towns within the South , radio_stations can be found beaming some or all_of their programs at Negro listeners.
   The Keystone_Broadcasting_System 's Negro network includes 360 affiliated stations , whose signals reach more_than half the total U._S._Negro population.
     One question which inevitably crops_up is whether such stations have a future in a nation where the Negro is moving_into a fully integrated status.
     Whatever the long-range impact of integration , the owners of Negro-appeal radio_stations these days know they have an audience and that it is loyal.
   Advertisers have discovered the tendency of Negroes to shop for brand names they have heard on stations catering to their special interests.
   And many advertisers have been happy with the results of letting a Negro disc_jockey phrase the commercial in his own words , working only from a fact sheet.
     What sets Negro-appeal programing apart from other radio shows?
   Sponsor magazine notes the stress on popular Negro bands and singers ; rhythm-and-blues mood music ;  race  music , folk_songs and melodies , and gospel programs.
   Furthermore , news and special presentations inform the listener about groups , projects , and personalities rarely mentioned on a general-appeal station.
   Advertising copy frequently takes_into_account matters of special Negro concern.
     Sponsor quotes John_McLendon of the McLendon-Ebony station group as saying that the Southern_Negro is becoming conscious_of quality and and  does not wish to be associated with radio which is any way degrading to his race ; he tends to shy_away_from the hooting and hollering personalities that originally made Negro radio programs famous .
     The sociological impact is perhaps most eloquently summed_up in_this quotation of J._Walter_Carroll of KSAN , San_Francisco :      Negro-appeal radio is more important to the Negro today , because it provides a direct and powerful mirror in_which the Negro can hear and see his ambitions , achievements and desires.
   It will continue to be important as a means of orientation to the Negro , seeking to become urbanized , as he tries to make adjustment to the urban life.
   Negro radio is vitally necessary during the process of assimilation .
     Presentation of  The Life and Times of John_Sloan  in the Delaware_Art_Center here suggests a current nostalgia for human values in art.
     Staged by way of announcing the gift of a large and intimate Sloan collection by the artist 's widow , Helen_Farr_Sloan , to the Wilmington_Society of the Fine_Arts , the exhibition presents a survey of Sloan 's work.
   From early family portraits , painted before he entered the schools of the Pennsylvania_Academy of the Fine_Arts , the chronology extends_to a group of paintings executed in his last year ( 1951 ) and still part of his estate.
     Few artists have left a life work so eloquent of the period in_which they lived.
   Few who have painted the scenes around them have done so with so little bitterness.
   The paintings , drawings , prints , and illustrations all reflect the manners , costumes , and mores of America in the first_half of the present century.
     Obviously Sloan 's early years were influenced by his close friend Robert_Henri.
   As early as 1928 , however , the Sloan style began to change.
   The dark pigments of the early work were superseded by a brighter palette.
   The solidity of brush stroke yielded to a hatching technique that finally led to virtual abandonment of American genres in favor of single figure studies and studio nudes.
     The exhibition presents all phases of Sloan 's many-sided art.
   In_addition to the paintings are drawings , prints , and illustrations.
   Sloan created such works for newspaper supplements before syndication threw him out of a job and sent him to roam the streets of New_York , thereby building for America an incomparable city survey from paintings of McSorley 's Saloon to breezy clotheslines on city roofs.
     One of the_most appealing of the rooftop canvases is  Sun and Wind on the Roof  , with a woman and child bracing themselves against flapping clothes and flying birds.
   Although there are landscapes in the show ( one of the strongest is a vista of  Gloucester_Harbor  in 1915 ) , the human element was the compelling factor in Sloan 's art.
     Significant are such canvases as  Bleeker_Street , Saturday_Night  , with its typically American crowd ( Sloan never went abroad ) ; the multifigure  Traveling_Carnival  , in_which action is vivified by lighting ; or  Carmine_Theater , 1912  , the only canvas with an ash can ( and foraging dog ) , although Sloan was a member of the famous  Eight  , and of the so-called  Ash-Can_School  , a term he resented.
     Not all the paintings , however , are of cities.
   The exhibition touches briefly on his sojourn in the Southwest (  Koshare in the Dust  , a vigorous Indian dance , and landscapes suggest the influence of western color on his palette ).
     The fact that Sloan was an extrovert , concerned primarily with what he saw , adds greatly to the value of his art as a human chronicle.
     There are 151 items in the Wilmington show , including one painting by each member of the  Eight  , as_well as work by Sloan 's friends and students.
   Supplementing the actual art are memorabilia - correspondence , diaries , books from the artist 's library , etc..
   All belong_to the collection being given to Wilmington over a period of years by Mrs._Sloan , who has cherished such revelatory items ever since she first studied with Sloan at the Art_Students League , New_York , in the 1920 's.
     To enable students and the public to spot Sloan forgeries , the Delaware_Art_Center ( according to its director , Bruce_St._John ) will maintain a complete file of photographs of all Sloan works , as_well as a card index file.
   The entire Sloan collection will be made available at the center to all serious art_students and historians.
     The current exhibition , which remains on view through Oct. 29 , has tapped 14 major collections and many private sources.
     Any musician playing Beethoven here , where Beethoven was_born , is likely to examine his own interpretations with special care.
   In_a_sense , he is offering Bonn what its famous son ( who left as a youth ) never did - the sound of the composer 's mature style.
     Robert_Riefling , who gave the only piano recital of the recently concluded 23 rd Beethoven_Festival , penetrated deep into the spirit of the style.
   His readings were careful without being fussy , and they were authoritative without being presumptuous.
   The 32 C minor Variations with which he opened moved fluently yet logically from one to another , leaving the right impression of abundance under discipline.
     The D minor Sonata , Op. 31 No. 2 , introduced by dynamically shaped arpeggios , was most engaging in its moments of quasi-recitative - single lines in_which the fingers seemed to be feeling their way toward the idea to come.
   These inwardly dramatic moments showed the kind_of  opera style  of_which Beethoven was genuinely capable , but which did not take so kindly to the mechanics of staging.
     Two late Sonatas , Op. 110 and 111 , were played with similar insight , the disarming simplicities of the Op. 111 Adagio made plain without ever becoming obvious.
   The two were separated from each other by the Six Bagatelles of Op. 126.
   Herr_Riefling , in everything he gave his large Beethoven_Hall audience , proved himself as an interpreter of unobtrusive authority.
     Volker_Wangenheim , who conducted Bonn 's Sta ^ dtisches Orchester on the following evening , made one more conscious_of the process of interpretation.
   Herr_Wangenheim has only recently become the city 's music_director , and is a young_man with a clear flair for the podium.
     But he weighted the Eighth_Symphony , at_times , with a shuddering subjectivity which seemed considerably at_odds with the music.
   He might have been hoping , to all appearances , that this relatively sunny symphony , in conjunction with the Choral_Fantasy at the end of the program , could amount to something like the Ninth ; but no amount of head-tossing could make it so.
     The conductor 's preoccupation with the business of starting and stopping caused occasional raggedness , as with the first orchestra entrance in the Fourth_Piano_Concerto , but when he put his deliberations and obsequies aside and let the music move as designed , it did so with plenty of spring.
     The concerto 's soloist , Hans_Richter-Haaser , played with compensatory ease and economy , though without the consummate plasticity to_which we had been treated on the previous evening by Herr_Riefling.
   His was a burgomaster 's Beethoven , solid and sensible.
     Everybody returned after intermission for the miscellaneous sweepings of the Fantasy for Piano , Chorus , and Orchestra in C minor , made_up by its composer to fill_out one of his programs.
   The entrance of the Sta ^ dtisches Gesangverein ( Bonn 's civic chorus ) was worth all the waiting , however , as the young Rhenish voices finally brought the music to life.
     The last program of_this festival , which during two_weeks had sampled most compositional categories , brought the Cologne_Rundfunk-Sinfonie-Orchester and Rundfunkchor to Bonn 's gold-filled hall for a performance of the Missa_Solemnis.
    
    A tribe in ancient India believed the earth was a huge tea_tray resting_on the backs of three giant elephants , which in_turn stood on the shell of a great tortoise.
   This theory eventually proved inexact.
   But the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at_least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science.
     It is the business of cosmologists , the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe , to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked_open other doors.
   These keys are the working_principles of physics , mathematics and astronomy , principles which are then extrapolated , or projected , to explain phenomena of_which we have little or no direct knowledge.
     In the autumn of 1959 , the_British Broadcasting_Corporation presented a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology.
   Three of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other acted_as a moderator.
   The participants were Professor_H._Bondi , professor of mathematics at King 's College , London ; Dr._W._B._Bonnor , reader in mathematics at Queen_Elizabeth_College , London ; Dr._R._A._Lyttleton , a lecturer at St._John 's College , Cambridge , and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the University of Cambridge ; and Dr._G._J._Whitrow , reader in applied_mathematics at the Imperial_College of Science and Technology , London.
     Dr._Whitrow functioned as moderator.
   The programs were so well received by the_British public that the arguments have been published in a totally engrossing little book called ,  Rival Theories of Cosmology .
     Dr._Bonnor begins with a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe , based on the general theory_of_relativity.
   First_of_all , and this has been calculated by observation , the universe is expanding - that_is , the galaxies are receding from each other at immense speeds.
   Because of_this Dr._Bonnor holds that the universe is becoming more thinly populated by stars and whatever else is there.
   This expansion has been going_on for an estimated eight billion years.
     Dr._Bonnor supports the idea that the universe both expands and contracts , that in several billion years the expansion will slow_up and reverse itself and that the contraction will set_in.
   Then , after many_more billions of years , when all the galaxies are whistling toward a common center , this movement will slow_down and reverse itself again.
     Professor_Bondi disagrees with the expansion-contraction theory.
   He supports the steady-state theory which holds that matter is continually being created in space.
   For this reason , he says , the density of the universe always remains the same even_though the galaxies are zooming away in_all_directions.
   New galaxies are forever being formed to fill_in the gaps left by the receding galaxies.
     If this is true , then the universe today looks just_as it did millions of years ago and as it will look millions of years hence , even_though the universe is expanding.
   For new galaxies to be created , Professor_Bondi declares , it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen_atom to be created in an area the size of your living_room once every few million years.
   He contends this idea does n't conflict with experiments on_which the principle of conservation_of_matter and energy is based because some slight error must be assumed in such experiments.
     Dr._Lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an electric universe and this theory starts with the behavior of protons and electrons.
   Protons and electrons bear opposite electrical charges which make them attract each other , and when they are joined they make_up an atom of hydrogen - the basic building_block of matter.
   The charges of the electron and proton are believed to be exactly equal and opposite , but Dr._Lyttleton is not so sure.
   Suppose , says Dr._Lyttleton , the proton has a slightly greater charge than the electron ( so slight it is presently immeasurable ).
   This would give the hydrogen_atom a slight charge-excess.
     Now if one hydrogen_atom were placed at the surface of a large sphere of hydrogen_atoms , it would be subject both to the gravitation of the sphere and the charge-excess of all those atoms in the sphere.
   Because electrical forces ( the charge-excess ) are far more powerful than gravitation , the surface hydrogen_atoms would shoot away from the sphere.
     Dr._Lyttleton then imagines the universe as a large hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shooting away from_it.
   This , he claims , would reasonably account_for the expansion of the universe.
     This slim book , while giving the reader only a fleeting glimpse of the scientific mind confronting the universe , has the appeal that informed conversation always has.
   Several photographs and charts of galaxies help the non-scientist keep_up with the discussion , and the smooth language indicates the contributors were determined to avoid the jargon that seems to work its way into almost every field.
     It is clear from this discussion that cosmologists of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man-made satellite can be equipped with optical_devices which will open_up new vistas to science.
   Presently , the intense absorption of ultra-violet rays in the earth 's atmosphere seriously hinders ground observation.
   These scientists are convinced that a telescope unclouded by the earth 's gases will go_a_long_way toward bolstering or destroying cosmic theories.
     There would seem to be some small solace in the prospect that the missile race between nations is at_the_same_time accelerating the study of the space around us , giving us a long-sought ladder from which to peer at alien regions.
     In doing_away_with the tea_tray , the elephants and the giant_tortoise , science has developed a series of rationally defensible explanations of the cosmos.
   And although the universe may forever defy understanding , it might even now be finding its match in the imagination of man.
    Roots  , the new play at the brand-new Mayfair_Theater on 46 th St. which has been made_over from a night club , is about the intellectual and spiritual awakening of an English farm_girl.
   Highly successful in England before its transfer to New_York , most_of  Roots  is as relentlessly dour as the trappings of the small new theater are gaudy.
     Only in its final scene , where Beatie_Bryant ( Mary_Doyle ) shakes_off the disappointment of being jilted by her intellectual lover and proclaims her emancipation do we get much which makes worthwhile the series of boorish rustic happenings we have had to watch for most_of the first two and one-half acts.
     The burden of Mr._Wesker 's message is that people living close_to the soil ( at_least in England ) are not the happy , fine , strong , natural , earthy people city-bred intellectuals imagine.
   Rather they are genuine clods , proud_of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminating influences of aesthetics or thought.
   They care no_more for politics , says Mr._Wesker , than they do for a symphony.
   Seeming to have roots in the soil , they actually have none in life.
   They dwell , in_short , in the doltish twilight in_which peasants and serfs of the past are commonly reported to have lived.
     But this is a theme which does not take so_much time to state as Mr._Wesker dedicates to_it.
   So_much untidiness of mind and household does not attract the interest of the theatergoer ( unless he has been living in a gilded palace , perhaps , and wants a real big heap of contrast ).
   The messy meals , the washing of dishes , the drying of clothes may be realism , but there is such a thing as redundancy.
     Now for the good points.
   Miss_Doyle as Beatie has a great fund of animal spirits , a strong voice and a warm smile.
   She is just home from a sojourn in London where she has become the sweetheart of a young fellow named Ronnie ( we never do see him ) and has been subjected to a first course in thinking and appreciating , including a dose of good British socialism.
   But while she is able to tell her retarded family about the new_world she has seen open before her , Ronnie has not been able to observe her progress , and instead of appearing at a family party to be looked over like a new bull , he sends Beatie a letter of dismissal.
     Beatie , getting no sympathy for her misfortune , soon rallies and finds that although she has lost a lover she has gained her freedom.
   Despite a too long sustained declamatory flight , this final speech is convincing , and we see why British audiences apparently were impressed by  Roots .
     There were several fairly good minor portraits in the play , including William_Hansen 's impersonation of a stubborn , rather pathetic father , and Katherine_Squire 's vigorous characterization of a farm mother who brooked no hifalutin ' nonsense from her daughter , or anyone else.
   But I am afraid Mr._Wesker 's meat and potatoes dish is n't well seasoned enough for local audiences.
     Shakespeare had a word for everything , even for the rain that disrupted Wednesday night 's  Much Ado About Nothing  opening the season of free theatre in Central_Park.
     The New_York Shakespeare_Festival , which is using the Wollman_Memorial Skating_Rink while its theatre near the Belvedere is being completed , began bravely.
   Joseph_Papp , impassioned founder of the festival and director of  Much Ado  , had a vibrant , colorful production under_way.
   Using a wide stage resourcefully he mingled music and dance with Shakespeare 's words in a spirited mixture.
     The audience filled all the seats inside the Wollman enclosure and overflowed onto the lawns outside the fence.
   The barbed sallies of Beatrice and Benedick , so contemporary to a public inured to the humor of insult , raised chuckles.
   The simple-minded comedy of Dogberry and Verges , also familiar in a day that responds easily to jokes skimmed_off the top of writers ' heads , evoked laughter.
   The vivacity of the masquers ' party at Leonato 's palace , with the Spanish motif in the music and dancing in honor of the visiting Prince of Arragon , cast a spell of delight.
     As  Much Ado  turned serious while the insipid Claudio rejected Hero at the altar , a sprinkle began to fall.
   At_first hardly_a person in the audience moved , although some umbrellas were opened.
   But the rain came more heavily , and men and women in light summer clothes began to depart.
   The grieving Hero and her father , Leonato , followed by the Friar , left the stage.
   A voice on the loudspeaker_system announced that if the rain let_up the performance would resume in ten minutes.
     More_than half the audience departed.
   Some remained in the Wollman enclosure , fortified with raincoats or with newspapers to cover their heads.
   Others huddled under the trees outside the fence.
   Twenty minutes after the interruption , although it was still raining , the play was resumed at the point in the fourth act where it had been stopped.
     Beatrice ( Nan_Martin ) and Benedick ( J._D._Cannon ) took their places on_the_stage.
   In their very first speeches it was clear that Shakespeare , like a Nostradamus , had foreseen this moment.
     Said Benedick :  Lady_Beatrice , have you wept all this while ?
     Replied Beatrice :  Yea , and I will weep a while longer .
     The heavens refused to give_up their weeping.
   The gallant company completed Act 4 , and got_through part of Act 5 ,.
   But the final scenes could not be played.
   If any among the hardy hundreds who sat in the downpour are in doubt about how it comes_out , let them take comfort.
    Much Ado  ends happily.
     The Parks_Department has done an admirable job of preparing the Wollman_Rink for Shakespeare.
   One could hardly blame Newbold_Morris , the Parks_Commissioner , for devoting so_much grateful mention to the department 's technicians who at short notice provided the stage with its rising platforms , its balcony , its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the villains.
     Eldon_Elder , who designed the stage , also created a gay , spacious set that blended attractively with the park background and Shakespeare 's lighthearted mood.
   Mr._Papp has directed a performance that has verve and pace , although he has tolerated obvious business to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency of style would be preferable.
    
    Elisabeth_Schwarzkopf sang so magnificently Saturday night at Hunter_College that it seems a pity to have_to register any complaints.
   Still a demurrer or two must be entered.
     Schwarzkopf is , of_course , Schwarzkopf.
   For style and assurance , for a supreme and regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her.
   If the voice is just a shade less glorious than it used_to be , it is still a beautiful instrument , controlled and flexible.
   Put to the service of lieder of Schubert , Brahms , Strauss and Wolf in a dramatical and musical way , it made its effect with ease and precision.
     But what has been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism.
   Instead of her old confidence in the simplest , purest , most moving musical expression , Miss_Schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic sin of artistic pride - that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the music by bringing to it something extra , some personal dramatic touch imposed from_the_outside.
     The symptoms Saturday night were unmistakable.
   Clever light songs were overly coy , tragic songs a_little too melodramatic.
   There was an extra pause here , a gasp or a sigh there , here_and_there an extra little twist of a word or note , all_in the interest of effect.
   The result was like that of a beautiful painting with some of the highlights touched_up almost to_the_point of garishness.
     There were stunning musical_phrases too , and sometimes the deepest kind_of musical and poetic absorption and communication.
   Miss_Schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist , John_Wustman , often achieved the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition.
   All the more reason why there should have been no place for the frills ; Miss_Schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them.
     The dance , dancers and dance enthusiasts ( 8500 of them ) had a much better time of_it at Lewisohn_Stadium on Saturday night than all had had two nights earlier , when Stadium Concerts presented the first of two dance programs.
     On Saturday , the orchestra was sensibly situated down on the field , the stage floor was apparently in decent condition for dancing , and the order of the program improved.
     There was , additionally , a bonus for the Saturday-night patrons.
   Alvin_Ailey and Carmen_De_Lavallade appeared in the first New_York performance of Mr._Ailey 's  Roots of the_Blues  , a work given its premiere three weeks ago at the Boston_Arts_Festival.
     Otherwise , the program included , as on Thursday , the Taras-Tchaikovsky  Design for Strings  , the Dollar-Britten  Divertimento  , the Dollar-De_Banfield  The Duel  and the pas_de_deux from  The Nutcracker .
     Maria_Tallchief and Erik_Bruhn , who danced the  Nutcracker  pas_de_deux , were also seen in the Petipa-Minkus pas_de_deux from  Don_Quixote  , another brilliant showpiece that displayed their technical prowess handsomely.
     Among the other solo ballet_dancers of the evening , Elisabeth_Carroll and Ivan_Allen were particularly impressive in their roles in  The Duel  , a work that depends so_much upon the precision and incisiveness of the two principal combatants.
     Mr._Ailey 's  Roots of the_Blues  , an earthy and very human modern_dance work , provided strong contrast to the ballet selections of the evening.
     As Brother_John_Sellers sang five  blues  to the guitar and drum accompaniments of Bruce_Langhorne and Shep_Shepard , Mr._Ailey and Miss_De_Lavallade went_through volatile dances that were by turns insinuating , threatening , contemptuous and ecstatic.
     Their props were two stepladders , a chair and a palm fan.
   He wore the clothes of a laborer , and she was wondrously seductive in a yellow and orange dress.
     The cat-like sinuousness and agility of both dancers were exploited in leaps , lifts , crawls and slides that were almost invariably compelling in a work of strong , sometimes almost frightening , tensions.
    Roots of the_Blues  may_not be for gentle souls , but others should welcome its super-charged impact.
      Perhaps it is better to stay at home.
   The armchair traveler preserves his illusions .
   This somewhat cynical comment may be_found in  Blue Skies , Brown_Studies  , a collection of travel essays by William_Sansom , who would never consider staying home for long.
   Mr._Sansom is English , bearded , formidably cultivated , the versatile author of numerous volumes of short_stories , of novels and of pieces that are neither short_stories nor travel articles but something midway between.
     The only man alive who seems qualified by his learning , his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance of language to inherit the literary mantle of Sacheverell_Sitwell , Mr._Sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding_cake for the marriage of a Hungarian beauty ( her third ) and an American multimillionaire ( his fourth ).
   The result is rather wonderful , but so rich as to be indigestible if taken in too thick slices.
     There are sixteen essays in  Blue Skies , Brown_Studies .
   Most_of them were written between 1953 and 1960 and originally appeared in various magazines.
   All are well written and are overwritten.
   But , even if Mr._Sansom labors too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from his travel experiences than the limits of language allow , he still can charm and astound.
   Too many books and articles are just assembled by putting one word after another.
   Mr._Sansom actually writes his with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence , with an intense relish in_all the metaphorical resources of English , with a thick shower of sophisticated , cultural references.
      I like to sniff a place , and reproduce what it really smells and looks_like , its color , its particular kind_of life .
   This is an exact description of_what Mr._Sansom does.
   He ignores guidebook facts.
   He only rarely tells a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketches an individual or quotes his opinions.
   It is an over-all impression Mr._Sansom strives for , an impression compounded of visual details , of a savory mixture of smells , of much loving attention to architecture and scenery , of lights and shadows , of intangibles of atmosphere and of echoes of the past.
     William_Sansom writes only about Europe in_this book and frequently of such familiar places as London , Vienna , the_French Riviera and the Norwegian fjords.
   But no_matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original mind and his own sensitive reactions.
    A writer lives , at_best , in a state of astonishment  , he says.
    Beneath any feeling he has of the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper one of wonder at it all.
   To transmit that feeling he writes .
   This may_not be true of many writers , but it certainly is true of Mr._Sansom.
   So in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of St._Torpetius that still persists in St._Tropez ; at the sun and the heat of Mediterranean lands , always much brighter and hotter to an Englishman than to an American used_to summers in New_York or Kansas_City ; at the supreme delights to be found in one of the world 's finest restaurants , La_Bonne_Auberge , which is situated on the seacoast twenty miles west of the Nice airport ; and at the infinite variety of London.
     Mr._Sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular way which recalls ( to those who recall easily ) the statues of Bernini and the gigantic paintings of Tintoretto.
   He can coin a neat phrase :  a street spattered with an invigoration of people  ; tulips with  petals wide and shaggy as a spaniel 's ears  ; after a snowstorm a landscape smelling  of woodsmoke and clarity .
   And , for all his lacquered , almost Byzantine self-consciousness , he can make one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison.
     In one of his best essays Mr._Sansom expresses his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by Andrea_Palladio himself that dot the environs of Vicenza.
   How far that pedimented and pillared style has shed its influence Mr._Sansom reminds us thus :      The white colonnaded , cedar-roofed Southern mansion is directly traceable via the grey and buff stone of grey-skied England to the golden stucco of one particular part of the_blue South , the Palladian orbit stretching out from Vicenza : the old mind of Andrea_Palladio still smiles from behind many_an old rocking_chair on a Southern porch , the deep friezes of his architectonic music rise firm above the shallower freeze in the kitchen , his feeling for light and shade brings a glitter from a tall mint_julep , his sense of columns framing the warm velvet night has brought_together a_million couple of mating lips .
   Nice , even if a_trifle gaudy.
      Blue Skies , Brown_Studies  is illustrated with numerous excellent photographs.
     In recent days there have been extensive lamentations over the absence of original drama on television , but not for years have many regretted the passing of new plays on radio.
   WBAI , the listener-supported outlet on the frequency-modulation band , has decided to do what it can to correct this aural void.
   Yesterday it offered  Poised for Violence  , by Jean_Reavey.
     WBAI is on the right track : in the sound medium there has been excessive emphasis on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre , as the Canadian and British Broadcasting Corporations continue to demonstrate.
   Unfortunately ,  Poised for Violence  was not the happiest vehicle with which to make the point.
     Mrs._Reavey 's work is written for the stage - it is mentioned for an off-Broadway production in the fall - and , in_addition , employs an avant-garde structure that particularly needs to be seen if comprehension is to be encouraged.
     The play 's device is to explore society 's obsession with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group of artist 's models who remain part of someone else 's painting rather_than just be themselves.
   In a succession of scenes they appear in different guises - patrons of a cafe , performers in a circus and participants in a family picnic - but in each instance they inevitably put ugliness before beauty.
     Somewhere in Mrs._Reavey 's play there is both protest and aspiration of merit.
   But its relentless discursiveness and determined complexity are so overwhelming that after an hour and a half a listener 's stamina begins to wilt.
   Moreover , her central figures are so busily fulfilling their multitudinous assignments that none emerges as an arresting individual in his own right or as a provocative symbol of mankind 's ills.
     But quite conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve the burden on the author 's words.
   Which in itself is an immediate reward of the WBAI experiment ; good radio drama has its own special demands that badly need reinvigoration.
     A weekly showcase for contemporary music , from the austere archaism of Stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music , is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month.
     Titled  What 's New in Music ?
 the enterprising program is heard Saturday afternoons on radio_station WQXR.
     The brief notes introducing each work offer salient historical or technical points , and many listeners are probably grateful for being intelligently taken by the hand through an often difficult maze.
   The show is programed and written by the station 's assistant continuity editor , Chuck_Briefer.
     The first Saturday in each_month is set_aside for new recordings.
   Last Saturday 's interesting melange included Ernst_Toch , Karlheinz_Stockhausen , Richard_Yardumian and a brief excerpt from a new  space  opera by the Swedish composer , Karl-Birger_Blomdahl.
     Other Saturdays are devoted_to studies of a selected American composer , a particular type of music or the music of a given country.
     It is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is set_aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene.
   But one wishes , when the appetite is whetted , as it was in the case of the all-too-brief excerpt from the Blomdahl opera , that further opportunity would be provided both for hearing the works in their entirety and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions.
     The Moiseyev_Dance_Company dropped_in at Madison_Square_Garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before it brings its long American tour to a close.
     It is not simply giving a repetition of the program it gave during its New_York engagement earlier this season , but has brought back many_of the numbers that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won everybody 's heart.
     It is good to see those numbers again.
   The  Suite of Old_Russian Dances  that opened that inaugural program with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and built steadily into typical Moiseyev vigor and warmth ; the amusing  Yurochka  , in_which a hard-to-please young_man is given his come-uppance ; the lovely ( and of_course vigorous )  Polyanka  or  The Meadow  ; the three Moldavian dances entitled  Zhok  ; the sweet and funny little dance about potato planting called  Bul ' ba  ; and the hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day called  City_Quadrille  are all just_as good as one remembers them to have been , and they are welcome back.
     So , for_that_matter , are the newer dances - the  Kalmuk_Dance  with its animal movements , that genial juggling act by Sergei_Tsvetkov called  The Platter  , the rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called  Summer  ,  The Three Shepherds  of Azerbaijan hopping up on their staffs , and , of_course , the trenchant  Rock ' n ' Roll .
    
    As autumn starts its annual sweep , few Americans and Canadians realize how fortunate they are in having the world 's finest fall coloring.
   Spectacular displays of_this sort are relatively rare in the entire land surface of the earth.
   The only other regions so blessed are the_British Isles , western Europe , eastern China , southern Chile and parts of Japan , New_Zealand and Tasmania.
   Their autumn tints are all fairly low keyed compared with the fiery stabs of crimson , gold , purple , bronze , blue and vermilion that flame_up in North_America.
   Jack_Frost is not really responsible_for this great seasonal spectacle ; in_fact , a freezing autumn dulls the blaze.
   The best effects come from a combination of temperate climate and plenty of late-summer rain , followed by sunny days and cool nights.
   Foliage pilgrimages , either organized or individual , are becoming an autumn item for more_and_more Americans each_year.
   Below is a specific guide , keyed to the calendar.
     Late September finds Quebec 's color at its peak , especially in the Laurentian hills and in the area south of the St._Lawrence_River.
   In the Maritime_provinces farther east , the tones are a_little quieter.
   Ontario 's foliage is most vivid from about Sept. 23 to Oct. 10 , with both Muskoka ( 100 miles north of Toronto ) and Haliburton ( 125 miles northwest of Toronto ) holding color cavalcades starting Sept. 23.
   In the Canadian Rockies , great groves of aspen are already glinting gold.
     Vermont 's sugar_maples are scarlet from Sept. 25 to Oct. 15 , and often hit a height in early October.
   New_Hampshire figures its peak around Columbus_Day and boasts of all its hardwoods including the yellow of the birches.
   The shades tend to be a_little softer in the forests that blanket so_much of Maine.
   In western Massachusetts and northwest Connecticut , the Berkshires are at their vibrant prime the first week of October.
     The Adirondacks blaze brightest in early October , choice routes being 9 N from Saratoga up_to Lake_George and 73 and 86 in the Lake_Placid area.
   Farther south in New_York there is a heavy haze of color over the Catskills in mid-October , notably along routes 23 and 23 A.
   About the same time the Alleghenies and Poconos in Pennsylvania are magnificent - Renovo holds its annual Flaming Foliage Festival on Oct. 14 , 15.
   New_Jersey 's color varies from staccato to pastel all_the_way from the Delaware Water_Gap to Cape_May.
     During the first_half of October the_Blue Ridge and other parts of the Appalachians provide a spectacle stretching from Maryland and West_Virginia to Georgia.
   The_most brilliant displays are along the Skyline_Drive above Virginia 's Shenandoah_Valley and throughout the Great Smokies between North_Carolina and Tennessee.
     Michigan , Wisconsin and Minnesota have many superb stretches of color which reach their height from the last few days of September well into October , especially in their northern sections , e._g. , Wisconsin 's Vilas_County whose Colorama celebration is Sept. 29 - Oct.
8.
   In Wisconsin , take route 55 north of Shawano or routes 78 and 60 from Portage to Prairie_du_Chien.
   In Michigan , there is fine color on route 27 up_to the Mackinac Straits , while the views around Marquette and Iron_Mountain in the Upper_Peninsula are spectacular.
   In Minnesota , Arrowhead_County and route 53 north to International_Falls are outstanding.
   Farther south , there are attractive patches all_the_way to the Ozarks , with some seasonal peaks as late as early November.
   Illinois ' Shawnee_National_Forest , Missouri 's Iron_County and the maples of Hiawatha , Kan. should be at their best in mid-October.
     The Rockies have many  Aspencades  , which are organized tours of the aspen areas with frequent stops at vantage_points for viewing the golden panoramas.
   In Colorado , Ouray has its Fall_Color_Week_Sept. 22 - 29 , Rye and Salida both sponsor Aspencades Sept. 24 , and Steamboat_Springs has a week-long Aspencade_Sept. 25 - 30.
   New_Mexico 's biggest is at Ruidoso_Oct. 7 , 8 , while Alamogordo and Cloudcroft cooperate in similar trips Oct. 1.
     Two sharply contrasting places designed for public enjoyment are now on display.
     The Corn Palace at Mitchell , S._Dak. ,  the world 's corniest building  , has a carnival through Sept. 23 headlining the Three Stooges and Pee_Wee_Hunt.
   Since 1892 ears of red , yellow , purple and white corn have annually been nailed to 11 big picture panels to create hugh  paintings .
   The 1961 theme is the Dakota_Territorial_Centennial , with the pictures including the Lewis and Clark expedition , the first river steamboat , the 1876 gold_rush , a_little red schoolhouse on the prairie , and today 's construction of large Missouri_River reservoirs.
   The panels will stay up until they are replaced next summer.
     Longwood_Gardens , near Kennett_Square , Pa. ( about 12 miles from Wilmington , Del.
 ) , was developed and heavily endowed by the late Pierre_S._du_Pont.
   Every Wednesday night through Oct. 11 there will be an elaborate colored fountain display , with 229 nozzles throwing jets of water up_to 130 feet.
   The  peacock tail  nozzle throws a giant fan of water 100 feet wide and 40 feet high.
   The gardens themselves are open free_of_charge the year round , and the 192 permanent employes make sure that not a dead or wilted flower is ever seen indoors or out by any visitor.
   The greenhouses alone cover 3 - 1 2 acres.
     Carson_McCullers , after a long , painful illness that might have crushed a less-indomitable soul , has come_back with an absolute gem of a novel which jumped high on best-seller lists even before official publication.
   Though the subject - segregation in her native South - has been thoroughly worked , Miss_McCullers uses her poet 's instinct and storyteller 's skill to reaffirm her place at the very top of modern American writing.
     With an art that almost conceals art , J._D._Salinger can create a fictional world so authentic that it hurts.
   Here , in the_most eagerly awaited novel of the season ( his first since The Catcher in the Rye ) , he tells of a college_girl in flight from the life around her and the tart but sympathetic help she gets from her 25 - year-old brother.
     Althea_Urn.
   A deft , hilarious satire on very high French society involving a statesman with two enviable possessions , a lovely young bride and a head containing such weighty thoughts that he has occasionally to remove it for greater comfort.
   There is probably a moral in_all this about  mind vs. heart .
     Virgilia_Peterson , a critic by trade , has turned her critical eye pitilessly and honestly on herself in an autobiography more of the mind and heart than of specific events.
   It is an engrossing commentary on a repressive , upper-middle-class New_York way_of_life in the first part of_this century.
     This retelling by Louis_Zara of the brief , anguished life of Stephen_Crane - poet and master novelist at 23 , dead at 28 - is in novelized form but does not abuse its tragic subject.
     Rachel_Peden.
   Subtitled A Farmwife 's Almanac of Country_Living , this is a gentle and nostalgic chronicle of the changing seasons seen through the clear , humorous eye of a Hoosier housewife and popular columnist.
     Two noted troupes from overseas will get the fall dance season off to a sparkling start.
   Leningrad 's Kirov_Ballet , famous for classic purity of technique , begins its first U._S. tour in New_York ( through Sept.
30 ).
   The Bayanihan_Philippine_Dance_Company , with music and dances that depict the many facets of Filipino culture , opens its 60 - city U._S. tour in San_Francisco ( through Sept. 24 ) then , via one-night stands , moves_on to Los los_Angeles ( Sept. 29 - Oct. 1 ).
     With harvests in_full_swing , you can enjoy festivals for grapes at Sonoma , Calif. ( Sept. 22 - 24 ) , as_well as for cranberries at Bandon , Ore. ( Sept. 28 - Oct. 1 ) , for buckwheat at Kingwood , W._Va. ( Sept. 28 - 30 ) , sugar_cane at New_Iberia , La. ( Sept. 29 - Oct. 1 ) and tobacco at Richmond , Va. ( Sept. 23 - 30 ).
     The mule is honored at Benson , N._C. ( Sept. 22 , 23 ) and at Boron , Calif. ( Sept. 24 - Oct. 1 ) , while the legend of the Maid of the Mist is celebrated at Niagara_Falls through the 24 th.

   The 300 th anniversaries of Staten_Island ( through Sept. 23 ) and of Mamaroneck , N._Y. ( through Sept. 24 ) will both include parades and pageants.
     This French film , set in Italy , is a summertime splurge in shock and terror all shot in lovely sunny scenery - so breath-taking that at_times you almost forget the horrors the movie is dealing with.
   But slowly they take_over as Alain_Delon ( Life , Sept. 15 ) , playing a sometimes appealing but always criminal boy , casually tells a rich and foot-loose American that he is going_to murder him , then does it even while the American is trying to puzzle_out how Delon expects to profit from the act.
     Callas devotees will have good reason to do their customary cart wheels over a new and complete stereo version of the Bellini opera.

   Of the nation 's eight million pleasure-boat owners a sizable number have learned that late autumn is one of the loveliest seasons to be afloat - at_least in_that broad balmy region that lies below America 's belt line.
   Waterways are busy right_now from the Virginia capes to the Texas coast.
   There true yachtsmen often find November winds steadier , the waters_cooler , the fish hungrier , and rivers more pleasant - less turbulence and mud , and fewer floating logs.
     More_and_more boats move overland on wheels ( 1.8 million trailers are now in_use ) and Midwesterners taking long weekends can travel south with their craft.
   In the Southwest , the fall brings_out flotillas of boatsmen who find the summer too hot for comfort.
   And on northern shores indomitable sailors from Long_Island to Lake_Michigan will beat around the buoys in dozens of frostbite races.
   Some pleasant fall cruising country is mapped out below.
     Pleasure boating is just scooting into its best months in California as crisp breezes bring_out craft of every size on every kind_of water - ocean , lake and reservoir.
   Shore facilities are enormous - Los_Angeles harbors 5000 boats , and Long_Beach 3000 - but marinas are crowded everywhere.
   New docks and ramps are being rushed at Playa_del_Rey , Ventura , Dana_Point , Oceanside and Mission_Bay.
     Inland , outboard motorists welcome cooler weather and the chance to buzz over Colorado_River sandbars and Lake_Mead.
   Newest small-boat playground is the Salton_Sea , a once-dry desert sinkhole which is now a salty lake 42 miles long and 235 feet below sea_level.
   On Nov. 11 , 12 , racers will drive their flying shingles in 5 - mile laps over its 500 - mile speedboat course.
   In San_Francisco Bay , winds are gusty and undependable during this season.
   A sailboat may have a bone in her teeth one minute and lie becalmed the next.
   But regattas are scheduled right up_to Christmas.
   The Corinthian Yacht_Club in Tiburon launches its winter races Nov.
5.
     Hurricane_Carla damaged 70 % of the marinas in the Galveston-Port_Aransas area but fuel service is back to normal , and explorers can roam as far west as Port_Isabel on the Mexican border.
   Sailing activity is slowed_down by Texas northers , but power cruisers can move freely , poking_into the San_Jacinto , Trinity and Brazos_rivers ( fine tarpon fishing in the Brazos ) or pushing eastward to the pirate country of Barataria.
   Off Grand_Isle , yachters often visit the towering oil_rigs.
   The Mississippi_Sound leads into a protected waterway running about 200 miles from Pascagoula to Apalachicola.
     Memphis stinkpotters like McKellar_Lake , inside the city_limits , and sailors look_for autumn winds at Arkabutla_Lake where fall racing is now in_progress.
   River cruising for small craft is ideal in November.
   At New_Orleans , 25 - mile-square Lake_Pontchartrain has few squalls and year-long boating.
   Marinas are less plush than the Florida type but service is good and Creole cooking better.
     Ten_thousand twisty miles of shoreline frame the 30 - odd lakes in the vast Tennessee_River system that loops in and out of seven states.
   When dam construction began in 1933 , fewer than 600 boats used these waters ; today there are 48500.
    
    A year ago it was bruited that the primary character in Erich_Maria_Remarque 's new novel was based on the Marquis_Alfonso de Portago , the Spanish nobleman who died driving in the Mille_Miglia automobile_race of 1957.
   If this was in_fact Mr._Remarque 's intention he has achieved a notable failure.
   Clerfayt of  Heaven Has No Favorites  resembles Portago only in_that he is male and a race-driver - quite a bad race-driver , whereas Portago was a good one.
   He is a dull , unformed , and aimless person ; the twelfth Marquis de Portago was intelligent , purposeful , and passionate.
     One looked_forward to Mr._Remarque 's ninth book if only because not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile racing , as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised.
   Unhappily ,  Heaven Has No Favorites  does not alter the record except to add one more bad book to the list.
     Mr._Remarque 's conception of_this novel was sound and perhaps even noble.
   He proposed throwing together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery.
   His treatment of_it is something else.
   His heroine chooses to die - the price of recovery , years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium , being higher than she wishes to pay.
   Her lover precedes her in death , at the wheel , and presumably he too has chosen.
   Between the first meeting of Clerfayt and Lillian and this dismal denouement , Mr._Remarque has laid_down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse , some demure and rather fetching love-making , pleasant talk about some of the countryside and restaurants of Europe , and a modicum of automobile racing.
   The ramblings on life , death , and the wonder of_it all are distressing ; the love-making , perhaps because it is pale and low-key when one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness , is often charming ; the automobile racing bears little relation_to reality.
     This latter failure is more_than merely bad reportage and it is distinctly more important than it would have been had the author drawn Clerfayt as , say , a tournament golfer.
   Hazards to life and limb on the golf_course , while existent , are actuarially insignificant.
   Race-drivers , on_the_other_hand , are quite often killed on the circuit , and since it was obviously Mr._Remarque 's intention to establish automobile racing as life in microcosm , one might reasonably have expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not_only of techniques but of mores and attitudes.
   He does not.
   The jacket biography describes him as a former racing driver , and he may indeed have been , although I do not recall having encountered his name either in the records or the literature.
   Perhaps he has only forgotten a great_deal.
   The book carries a disclaimer in_which Remarque says it has been necessary for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures and formalities of racing.
   The necessity is not clear to me , and , in_any_case , to present a case-hardened race-driver as saying he has left his car , which , or whom , he calls  Giuseppe  , parked  on the Place_Vendome sneering at a dozen Bentleys and Rolls-Royces parked around him  is not a liberty ; it is an absurdity.
     But it is in the_matter of preoccupation with death , which is the primary concern of the book , that Remarque 's failure is plainest.
   Clerfayt is neurotic , preoccupied , and passive.
   To be human , he believes , is to seek one 's own destruction : the Freudian  death-wish  cliche inevitably cited whenever laymen talk_about auto race-drivers.
   In_point_of_fact , the race-drivers one knows are nearly always intelligent , healthy technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the passion they feel_for the work by which they live.
   A Clerfayt may moon_on about the face of Death in the cockpit ; a Portago could say , as he did say to me ,  If I die tomorrow , still I have had twenty-eight wonderful years ; but I sha n't die tomorrow ; I 'll live to be 105 .
     Clerfayt , transported , may think_of the engine driving his car as  a mystical beast under the hood .
   The Italian master Piero_Taruffi , no less sensitive , knows twice the ecstasy though he thinks_of a car 's adhesion to a wet two-lane road at 165 miles an hour as a matter best expressed in algebraic formulae.
   Clerfayt , driving , sees himself  a volcano whose cone funneled down to hell  ; the Briton_Stirling_Moss , one of the greatest virtuosi of_all_time , believes that ultra-fast road-circuit driving is an art_form related_to ballet.
     Errors in technical terminology suggest that the over-all translation from the German may not convey quite everything Mr._Remarque hoped to tell us.
     However , my principal objection in_this sort_of novel is to the hackneyed treatment of race-drivers , pilots , submariners , atomic researchers , and all the machine-masters of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists.
     The West is leaderless , according to this book.
   In contrast , the East is ably led by such stalwart heroes as Khrushchev , Tito , and Mao.
   Against this invincible determination to communize the whole world stands a group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals and each refusing to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common good of all.
     It is Field_Marshal Montgomery 's belief that in most Western countries about 60 per_cent of the people do not really care about democracy or Christianity ; about 30 per_cent call themselves Christians in_order_to keep_up appearances and be considered respectable , and only the last 10 per_cent are genuine Christians and believers in democracy.
     But these Western countries do care about themselves.
   Each feels intensely national.
   If , say , the Russians intended to stop Tom_Jones ' going_to the pub , then Tom_Jones would fight the Commies.
   But he would fight for his own liberty rather_than for any abstract principle connected with_it - such_as  cause .
   For all practical purposes , the West stands disunited , undedicated , and unprepared for the tasks of world leadership.
     With this barrage , Montgomery of Alamein launches his attack upon the blunderings of the West.
   Never given to mincing words , he places heavy blame upon the faulty , uncourageous leadership of Britain and particularly America.
   At_war 's end leadership in Western Europe passed from Britain because the Labour_Government devoted its attention to the creation of a welfare_state.
   With Britain looking inward , overseas problems were neglected and the baton was passed_on to the United_States.
     Montgomery believes that she started well.
    America gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend and foe alike .
   She pushed wartorn and poverty-stricken nations into prosperity , but she failed to lead them into unity and world peace.
   America has divided more_than she has united the West.
   The reasons are that America generally believes that she can buy anything with dollars , and that she compulsively strives to be liked.
   However , she really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars given_away by a quality of leadership that_is basically needed.
     But the greater reason for fumbling , stumbling American leadership is due_to the shock her pride suffered when the Japanese attacked at Pearl_Harbor.
    They are determined  , Montgomery writes ,  not to be surprised again , and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not_only unnecessary , but also creates nervousness among other nations in the Western Alliance - not_to_mention such great suspicions among the nations of the Eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful coexistence or disarmament is not possible .
     The net result is that under American leadership the general world situation has become bad.
   To  Monty  , the American people , who in two previous world_wars were very reluctant to join the fight ,  now look_like the nation most likely to lead us all into a third_World War .
     As faulty as has been our leadership clearly the United_States must be relied_upon to lead.
   The path to leadership is made clear.
   Montgomery calls_for a leader who will first put the West 's own house in_order.
   Such a man must be able and willing to give clear and sensible advice to the whole group , a person in whom all the member nations will have absolute confidence.
   This leader must be a man who lives above illusions that heretofore have shaped the foreign_policy of the United_States , namely that Russia will agree to a reunited Germany , that the East_German government does not exist , that events in Japan in June 1960 were Communist-inspired , that the true government of China is in Formosa , that Mao was the evil influence behind Khrushchev at the Summit_Conference in Paris in May 1960 , and that either China or Russia wants or expects war.
     Such a leader must strengthen NATO politically , and establish that true unity about which it has always talked.
   After drastically overhauling NATO , Western leadership should turn_to reducing the suspicions that tear_apart the East and West.
   Major to this effort is to get all world_powers to withdraw to their own territories , say by 1970.
    The West should make the central proposal ; but the East would have to show sincerity in carrying it out .
      But where is the leader who will handle all these things for us ?
   Montgomery knew all the national_leaders up_to the time of Kennedy.
   The man whom he would select as our leader for this great task is de Gaulle.
   He alone has the wisdom , the conviction , the tenacity , and the courage to reach a decision.
   But de Gaulle is buried in the cause of restoring France 's lost soul.
     Whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous path to leadership.
   The leader Montgomery envisages will need to discipline himself , lead a carefully regulated and orderly life , allow time for quiet thought and reflection , adapt decisions and plans to changing situations , be ruthless , particularly with inefficiency , and be honest and morally proper.
   All_in_all , Montgomery calls_for a leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him.
     In looking as far back as Moses , thence to Cromwell , Napoleon , Lincoln , Churchill , and Nehru , Montgomery attempts to trace the stirrings and qualities of great men.
   He believes that greatness is a marriage between the man and the times as was aptly represented by Churchill , who would very possibly have gone_down in history as a political failure if it had not been for Hitler 's war.
     However , Montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory and practice.
   Most_of what is said about his great men of history has already been said , and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary scene.
   Like Eisenhower , he holds the militarist 's suspicion of politicians.
   However , at_the_same_time Montgomery selects as his hero de Gaulle , who is a militarist dominated_by political ambitions.
    Monty  shows a remarkable capacity for the direct statement and an equally remarkable incapacity for giving adequate support.
   For_the_most_part , his writing rambles and jogs , preventing easy access by the reader to his true thoughts.
     Nevertheless , Montgomery has stated courageously and wisely the crisis of the Western world.
   It suffers from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership.
   And it remains to be seen if the new frontier now taking_form can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the current shape of events.
     It is no common thing for a listener ( critical or otherwise ) to hear a singer  live  for_the_first_time only after he has died.
   But then , Mario_Lanza was no common singer , and his whole career , public and non-public , was studded with the kind_of unconventional happenings that terminate with the appearance of his first  recital  only when he has ceased to be a living voice.
   It is a kind_of justice , too , that it should originate_in London 's Royal_Albert_Hall , where , traditionally , the loudest , if_not the greatest , performers have entertained the thousands it will accommodate ( RCA_Victor_LM 2454 , $ 4.98 ).
     To_be_sure , Lanza made numerous concert tours , here and abroad , but these did not take him to New_York where the carping critic might lurk.
    
    The reading public , the theatergoing public , the skindiving public , the horse-playing public - all these and_others fill substantial roles in U._S. life , but none is so varied , vast and vigilant as the eating public.
   The Department_of_Agriculture averaged_out U._S. food consumption last year at 1488 lbs. per person , which , allowing for the 17 million Americans that John_Kennedy said go_to_bed hungry every_night , means that certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow down 8 lbs. or more a day.
   That mother hen of the weight-height tables , the Metropolitan Life_Insurance Co. , clucks that 48 million Americans are overweight.
     Through previous centuries , eating changed by nearly imperceptible degrees , and mostly toward just getting enough.
   Now big forces buffet food.
   For_the_first_time in history , the U._S. has produced a society in_which less_than one-tenth of the people turn_out so_much food that the Government 's most embarrassing problem is how to dispose inconspicuously of 100 million tons of surplus farm produce.
   In_this same society , the plain citizen can with an average of only one-fifth his income buy more calories than he can consume.
   Refrigeration , automated processing and packaging conspire to defy season and banish spoilage.
   And in the wake of the new affluence and the new techniques of processing comes a new American interest in how what people eat affects their health.
   To eat is human , the nation is learning to think , to survive divine.
     Not all the concern for health is well directed.
   From the fusty panaceas of spinach , eggs and prunes , the U._S. has progressed_to curds , concentrates and capsules.
   Each_year , reports the American_Medical_Association , ten million Americans spend $ 900 million on vitamins , tonics and other food supplements.
   At juice bars in Los_Angeles ' 35  health  stores , a new sensation is a pink , high-protein cocktail , concocted of dried eggs , powdered_milk and cherry-flavored No-Cal , which sells for 59 per 8 - oz. glass.
   Grocery_stores sell dozens of foods that boast of having almost_no food value at_all.
     But a big part of the public wants to know facts about diet and health , and a big group of U._S. scientists wants to supply them.
   The man most firmly at grips with the problem is the University of Minnesota 's Physiologist_Ancel_Keys , 57 , inventor of the wartime K ( for Keys ) ration and author of last year 's bestselling Eat_Well and Stay Well.
   From his birch-paneled office in the Laboratory of Physiological_Hygiene , under the university 's football_stadium in Minneapolis (  We get a rumble on every touchdown  ) , blocky , grey-haired Dr._Keys directs an ambitious , $ 200000 - a-year experiment on diet , which spans three continents and seven nations and is still growing.
   Pursuing it , he has logged 500000 miles , suffered indescribable digestive indignities , and meticulously collected physiological data on the health and eating habits of 10000 individuals , from Bantu tribesmen to Italian contadini.
   He has measured the skinfolds ( the fleshy areas under the shoulder_blades ) of Neapolitan firemen , studied the metabolism of Finnish woodcutters , analyzed the  mealie-meal  eaten by Capetown coloreds , and experimented on Minneapolis businessmen.
     Keys 's findings , though far from complete , are likely to smash many_an eating cliche.
   Vitamins , eggs and milk begin to look_like foods to hold_down on ( though mothers ' milk is still the ticket ).
   Readings of the number of milligrams of cholesterol in the blood , which seem to have value in predicting heart_attacks , are becoming as routine as the electrocardiogram , which can show that the heart has suffered a symptomatic attack.
   Already many_an American knows his count , and rejoices or worries depending_on whether it is nearer 180 ( safe ) or 250 ( dangerous ).
     Out of cholesterol come Keys 's main messages so_far :     Americans eat too_much.
   The typical U._S. daily menu , says Dr._Keys , contains 3000 calories , should contain 2300.
   And extra weight increases the risk of cancer , diabetes , artery disease and heart_attack.
     Americans eat too_much fat.
   With meat , milk , butter and ice_cream , the calorie-heavy U._S. diet is 40 % fat , and most_of that is saturated fat - the insidious kind , says Dr._Keys , that increases blood cholesterol , damages arteries , and leads to coronary disease.
     Throughout much of the world , food is still so scarce that half of the earth 's population has trouble getting the 1600 calories a day necessary to sustain life.
   The deficiency_diseases - scurvy , tropical sprue , pellagra - run rampant.
   In West_Africa , for_example , where meat is a luxury and babies must be weaned early to make room at the breast for later arrivals , a childhood menace is kwashiorkor , or  red Johnny  , a growth-stunting protein deficiency ( signs : reddish hair , bloated belly ) that kills more_than half its victims , leaves the rest prey for parasites and lingering tropical disease.
     In the well-fed U._S. , deficiency_diseases have virtually vanished in_the_past 20 years.
   Today , as Harrison 's Principles of Internal_Medicine , a standard internist 's text , puts it ,  The_most common form of malnutrition is caloric excess or obesity .
     Puritan New_England regarded obesity as a flagrant symbol of intemperance , and thus a sin.
   Says Keys :    Maybe if the idea got_around again that obesity is immoral , the fat man would start to think .
   Morals aside , the fat man has plenty to worry about - over and above the fact that no one any longer loves him.
   The simple mechanical strain of overweight , says New_York 's Dr._Norman_Jolliffe , can overburden and damage the heart  for much the same reason that a Chevrolet engine in a Cadillac body would wear_out sooner than if it were in a body for which it was built .
   The fat man has trouble buying life_insurance or has to pay higher premiums.
   He has - for unclear reasons - a 25 % higher death_rate from cancer.
   He is particularly vulnerable to diabetes.
   He may find even moderate physical_exertion uncomfortable , because excess body fat hampers his breathing and restricts his muscular movement.
     Physiologically , people overeat because what Dr._Jolliffe calls the  appestat  is set too high.
   The appestat , which adjusts the appetite to keep weight constant , is located , says Jolliffe , in the hypothalamus - near the body 's temperature , sleep and water-balance controls.
   Physical exercise raises the appestat.
   So does cold_weather.
   In moderate doses , alcohol narcotizes the appestat and enhances appetite ( the original reason for the cocktail ) ; but because liquor has a high caloric value - 100 calories per oz. - the heavy drinker is seldom hungry.
   In rare cases , diseases such_as encephalitis or a pituitary tumor may damage the appestat permanently , destroying nearly all sense of satiety.
     Far more_frequently , overeating is the result of a psychological compulsion.
   It may be fostered by frustration , depression , insecurity - or , in children , simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother 's nagging.
   Some families place undue emphasis on food : conversations center_on it , and rich delicacies are offered as rewards , withheld as punishment.
   The result says Jolliffe :  The child gains the feeling that food is the purpose of life .
   Food may act_as a sedative , giving temporary emotional solace , just_as , for some people , alcohol does.
   Reports Dr._Keys :  A fairly common experience for us is the wife who finds her husband staying out more_and_more.
   He may be interested in another woman , or just like being with the boys.
   So she fishes around in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate_cake.
   It 's a matter of boredom , and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something , because she 's being deprived of something else .
     For the army of compulsive eaters - from the nibblers and the gobblers to the downright gluttons - reducing is a war with the will that_is rarely won.
   Physiologist_Keys flatly dismisses such appetite depressants as the amphetamines ( Benzedrine , Dexedrine ) as dangerous  crutches for a weak will .
     Keys has no such objections to Metrecal , Quaker Oats 's Quota and other 900 - calorie milk formulas that are currently winning favor from dieters.
    Metrecal is a pretty complete food  , he says.
    It contains large amounts of protein , vitamins and minerals.
   In the quantity of 900 calories a day , anyone will lose_weight on_it - 20 , 30 or 40 lbs.
 .
   But Keys worries that the Metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological adjustment to the idea of eating smaller portions of food.
     Despite his personal distaste for obesity (  disgusting  ) , Dr._Keys has only an incidental interest in how much Americans eat.
   What concerns him much more is the relationship of diet to the nation 's No. 1 killer : coronary_artery disease , which accounts_for more_than half of all heart fatalities and kills 500000 Americans a year - twice the toll from all varieties of cancer , five times the deaths from automobile accidents.
     Cholesterol , the cornerstone of Dr._Keys 's theory , is a mysterious yellowish , waxy substance , chemically a crystalline alcohol.
   Scientists assume that cholesterol ( from the Greek chole , meaning bile , and sterios , meaning solid ) is somehow necessary for the formation of brain_cells , since it accounts_for about 2 % of the brain 's total solid weight.
   They know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones.
   They suspect it plays a role in the production of adrenal hormones , and they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the circulatory_system.
   But they cannot fully explain the process of its manufacture by the human liver.
   Although the fatty protein_molecules , carried in the blood and partly composed of cholesterol , are water soluble , cholesterol itself is insoluble , and cannot be destroyed by the body.
    A remarkable substance  , says Dr._Keys ,  quite apart from its tendency to be deposited in the walls of arteries .
     When thus deposited , Keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible_for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart_attacks.
   Explains Keys : As the fatty protein_molecules travel in the bloodstream , they are deposited in the intima , or inner wall of a coronary_artery.
   The proteins and fats are burned_off , and the cholesterol is left behind.
   As cholesterol piles_up , it narrows , irritates and damages the artery , encouraging formation of calcium deposits and slowing circulation.
   Eventually , says Keys , one of two things happens.
   A clot forms at the site , seals_off the flow of blood to the heart and provokes a heart_attack.
   Or ( more commonly , thinks Keys ) the deposits themselves get so big that they choke_off the artery 's flow to_the_point that an infarct occurs : the heart_muscle is suffocated , cells supplied by the artery die , and the heart is permanently , perhaps fatally injured.
     Ordinarily , the human liver synthesizes only enough cholesterol to satisfy the body 's needs - for transportation of fats and for production of bile.
   Even eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods , eaten in normal amounts , says Dr._Keys , do not materially affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood.
   But fatty foods do.
     During World_War 2 , , doctors in The_Netherlands and Scandinavia noted a curious fact : despite the stresses of Nazi occupation , the death_rate from coronary_artery disease was slowly dropping.
   Not until long after the war - 1950 , in_fact - did they get a hint of the reason.
   That year , Sweden 's Haqvin_Malmros showed that the sinking death_rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe restrictions on fatty foods.
   That same year the University of California 's Dr._Laurance_Kinsell , timing oxidation rates of blood fats , stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood cholesterol levels to drop radically , while animal_fats cause them to rise.
   Here Keys and_others , such_as Dr._A._E._Ahrens of the Rockefeller_Institute , took_over to demonstrate the chemical difference between vegetable and animal_fats - and even between different varieties of each.
     All natural food fats fall_into one of three categories - saturated , mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated.
   The degree of saturation depends_on the number of hydrogen_atoms on the fat molecule.
   Saturated fats can accommodate no_more hydrogens.
   Mono-unsaturated fats have room for two more hydrogens on each molecule , and the poly-unsaturated fat molecule has room for at_least four hydrogens.
     The three fats have similar caloric values ( about 265 calories per oz.
 ) , but each exerts a radically different influence on blood cholesterol.
    
    Furthermore , as an encouragement to revisionist thinking , it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislikes.
   The Unitarian clergy were an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen - as the term was then understood in_the_Back Bay - and Parker was definitely not a gentleman , either in theology or in manners.
   Ezra_Stiles_Gannett , an honorable representative of the sanhedrin , addressed himself frankly to the issue in 1845 , insisting that Parker should not be persecuted or calumniated and that in_this republic no power to restrain him by force could exist.
   Even_so , Gannett judiciously argued , the Association could legitimately decide that Parker  should not be encouraged nor assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard_to their correctness .
   We today are not entitled to excoriate honest men who believed Parker to be downright pernicious and who barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations.
   One can even argue - though this is a delicate matter - that every justification existed for their returning the Public_Lecture to the First_Church , and so to suppress it , rather_than let Parker use it as a sounding_board for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy it.
   Finally , it did seem clear as day to these clergymen , as Gannett 's son explained in the biography of his father , they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title of Christians.
   Their demand against the Calvinist_Orthodoxy for intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow  free inquiry  to the extreme of proclaiming Christianity a  natural  religion.
     Grant all this - still , when modern Unitarianism and the Harvard_Divinity_School recall with humorous affection the insults Parker lavished upon them , or_else argue that after_all Parker received the treatment he invited , they betray an uneasy conscience.
   Whenever New_England liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation of Parker and the fraternity on January 23 , 1843 - while it may defend the privilege of Chandler_Robbins to demand that Parker leave the Association , while it may plead that Dr._N._L._Frothingham had every warrant for stating ,  The difference between Trinitarians and Unitarians is a difference in Christianity ; the difference between Mr._Parker and the Association is a difference between no Christianity and Christianity  - despite these supposed conclusive assurances , the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh of relief , of positive thanksgiving , that the Association never quite brought itself officially to expel Parker.
   Had it done so , the blot on its escutcheon would have remained indelible , nor could the Harvard_Divinity_School assemble today to honor Parker 's insurgence other_than by getting_down on its collective knees and crying  peccavi .
     Happily for posterity , then , the Boston_Association did not actually command Parker to leave the room , though it came too_close for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality.
   Fortunately , the honor of the denomination can attest that Cyrus_Bartol defended Parker 's sincerity , as did also Gannett and Chandler_Robbins ; whereupon Parker broke_down into convulsions of weeping and rushed out of the room , though not out of the Fellowship.
   In the hall , after adjournment , Dr._Frothingham took him warmly by the hand and requested Parker to visit him - whereupon our burly Theodore again burst into tears.
     All this near tragedy , which to us borders_on comedy , enables us to tell the story over_and_over_again , always warming ourselves with a glow of complacency.
   It was indeed a near thing , but somehow the inherent decency of New_England ( which we inherit ) did triumph.
   Parker was never excommunicated.
   To the extent that he was ostracized or even reviled , we solace ourselves by saying he asked_for it.
   Yet , even after_all these stratagems , the conscience of Christian liberality is still not laid_to_rest , any_more than is the conscience of Harvard_University for having done the abject penance for its rejection of Ralph_Waldo_Emerson 's The Divinity_School_Address of naming its hall of philosophy after him.
   In both cases the stubborn fact remains : liberalism gave_birth to two brilliant apostates , both legitimate offspring of its loins , and when brought to the test , it behaved shabbily.
   Suppose they both had ventured into realms which their colleagues thought infidel :   is this the way gentlemen settle frank differences_of_opinion?
   Is it after_all possible that no_matter_how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any conservative has ever to worry about?
     However , there is a crucial difference between the two histories.
   Emerson evaded the problem by shoving it aside , or rather by leaving it behind him : he walked_out_of the Unitarian communion , so_that it could lick the wound of his departure , preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious veneration.
   Parker insisted upon not resigning , even when the majority wanted him to depart , upon daring the Fellowship to throw him out.
   Hence he was in his lifetime , as is the memory of him afterwards , a canker within the liberal sensitivity.
   He still points an accusing finger at_all of us , telling us we have neither the courage to support him nor the energy to cut his throat.
     Actually , the dispute between Parker and the society of his time , both ecclesiastical and social , was a real one , a bitter one.
   It cannot be smoothed_over by now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self-deprecation or by solemnly calling_for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections to him.
   The fact is incontestable : that liberal world of Unitarian_Boston was narrow-minded , intellectually sterile , smug , afraid_of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm , and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle foundations were threatened.
   Parker , along with Garrison and Charles_Sumner , showed a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs mobilized in defense of the Mexican War and slavery.
   Nevertheless , we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace ; their passions were genuine , and the division between them and the abolitionists is clear-cut.
   But Parker as the ultra-liberal minister within the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository of liberality poses a different problem , which is not to be resolved by holding him up as the champion of freedom.
   Even_though his theological theses have become , to us , commonplaces , the fundamental interrogation he phrased is very_much with us.
   It has been endlessly rephrased , but I may here put it thus : at what point do the tolerant find themselves obliged to become intolerant?
   And_then , as they become aware that they have reached the end of their patience , what do they , to their dismay , learn for_the_first_time about themselves?
     There can be no_doubt , the Boston of_that era could be exquisitely cruel in enforcing its canons of behavior.
   The gentle Channing , revered by all Bostonians , orthodox or Unitarian , wrote to a friend in Louisville that among its many virtues Boston did not abound_in a tolerant spirit , that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and action :  No city in the world is governed so little by a police , and so_much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment.
   We stand more in_awe_of one another than most people.
   Opinion is less individual or runs more into masses , and often rules with a rod of iron .
   Even more poignantly , and with the insight of a genius , Channing added - remember , this is Channing , not Parker!
   - that should a minister in Boston trust himself to his heart , should he  speak without book , and consequently break some law of speech , or be hurried into some daring hyperbole , he should find little mercy .
     Channing wrote this - in a letter!
   I think it fair to say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons.
   But Theodore_Parker , commencing his mission to the world-at-large , disguised as the minister of a  twenty-eighth Congregational_Church  which bore no resemblance to the Congregational polities descended from the founders ( among which were still the Unitarian churches ) , made explicit from_the_beginning that the conflict between him and the Hunkerish society was not something which could be evaporated into a genteel difference about clerical decorum.
   Because he spoke openly with what Channing had prophesied someone might - with daring hyperbole - Parker vindicated Channing 's further prophecy that he who committed this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines.
   An institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an institution , and only within those defined limits a license.
     By reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation , we should , I am sure , come_to a fresh realization , however painful it be , that the battle between Parker and his neighbors was fought in_earnest.
   He arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had to respond with , at_the_least , resentment.
   What otherwise could  the lawyer , doctor , minister , the men_of_science and letters  do when told that they had  become the cherubim and seraphim and the three archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant , and continually cried , ' Holy , holy , holy is the Almighty Dollar  '?
   Nor , when we recollect how sensitive were the emotions of the old Puritan stock in regard_to the recent tides of immigration , should we be astonished that their thin lips were compressed into a white_line of rage as Parker snarled at them thus :  Talk_about the Catholics voting as the bishop tells!
   reproach the Catholics for it!
   You and I do the same thing.
   There are a great many bishops who have never had a cross on their bosom , nor a mitre on their head , who appeal not to the authority of the Pope at Rome , but to the Almighty Dollar , a pope much nearer home.
   Boston has been controlled by a_few capitalists , lawyers and other managers , who told the editors what to say and the preachers what to think .
   This was war.
   Parker meant_business.
   And he took repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intended them :  Even the Unitarian churches have caught the malaria , and are worse than those who deceived them  - which implied that they were very bad indeed.
   It was  Duty  he said that his parents had given him as a rule - beyond even the love that suffused his being and the sense_of_humor with which he was largely supplied - and it was duty he would perform , though it cost him acute pain and exhausted him by the age of fifty.
   Parker could weep - and he wept astonishingly often and on the slightest provocation - but the psychology of those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to massacre his opponents.
    If it gave me pleasure to say hard things  , he wrote ,  I would shut_up forever .
   We have to tell ourselves that when Parker spoke in_this vein , he believed what he said , because he could continue ,  But the truth , which cost me bitter tears to say , I must speak , though it cost other tears hotter than fire .
   Because he copiously shed his own tears , and yielded himself up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of New_England , he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other people 's consciences.
     Our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how strenuous was the fight is muffled by our indifference to the very issue which in the Boston of 1848 seemed to be the central hope of its Christian survival , that of the literal , factual historicity of the miracles as reported in the Four Gospels.
   It is idle to ask why we are no_longer disturbed if somebody , professing the deepest piety , decides anew that it is of no importance whether or not Christ transformed the water into wine at eleven A._M. on the third of August , A._D. 32.
   We have no answer as to why we are not alarmed.
   So we are the more prepared to give Parker the credit for having taken the right side in an unnecessary controversy , to salute his courage , and to pass_on , happily forgetting both him and the entire episode.
   We have not the leisure , or the patience , or the skill , to comprehend what was working in_the_mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the Harvard_Divinity_School who would muster the audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor , the majesterial Andrews_Norton , by saying that , while he believed Jesus  like other religious teachers  , worked miracles ,  I see not how a miracle proves a doctrine .
    
    I have , within the past fifty years , come_out of all uncertainty into a faith which is a dominating conviction of the Truth and about which I have not a shadow of doubt.
   It has been my lot all through life to associate with eminent scientists and at_times to discuss with them the deepest and most vital of all questions , the nature of the hope of a life beyond this.
   I have also constantly engaged in scientific work and am fully aware_of the value of opinions formed in science as_well as in the religions in the world.
   n an amateu6rish , yet in a very real sense , I have followed the developments of archaeology , geology , astronomy , herpetology , and mycology with a hearty appreciation of the advances being made in these fields.
     At_one_time I became disturbed in the faith in_which I had grown_up by the apparent inroads being made upon both Old and New_Testaments by a  Higher_Criticism  of the Bible , to refute which I felt the need of a better knowledge of Hebrew and of archaeology , for it seemed to me that to pull_out some of the props of our faith was to weaken the entire structure.
     Doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for_a_while and , like some higher critical friends , trying to continue to use the Bible as the Word_of_God while at_the_same_time holding it to have been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations :   attempting to bridge the chasm between an older , reverent , Bible-loving generation and a critical , doubting , Bible-emancipated race.
   Although still aware_of a great light and glow of warmth in the Book , I stood outside shivering in the cold.
     In one thing the higher critics , like the modernists , however , overreached themselves , in claiming that the Gospel of John was not written in John 's time but well after the first century , perhaps as late as 150 A._D..
   Now , if any part of the Bible is assuredly the very Word_of_God speaking through His servant , it is John 's Gospel.
   To ask me to believe that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after_all the events by some admiring follower , and was not inspired directly by the Spirit of God , is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any of those recorded in the Bible.
   Here I took my leave of my learned friends to step out on another path , to_which we might give the modern name of Pragmatism , or the thing that works.
   Test it , try it , and if it works , accept it as a guiding principle.
     So , I put my Bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself , and_then tested it to see how it worked.
   As a short , possibly not the best method , I looked_up  Word  in the Concordance and noted that the Bible claims from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22 to be God 's personal message to man.
   The next traditional step then was to accept it as the authoritative textbook of the Christian faith just_as one would accept a treatise on any earthly  science  , and I submitted to its conditions according to Christ 's invitation and promise that ,  If any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself  ( John 7 : 17 ).
     The outcome of such an experiment has been in_due_time the acceptance of the Bible as the Word_of_God inspired in_a_sense utterly different from any merely human book , and with_it the acceptance of our Lord Jesus_Christ as the only begotten Son of God , Son of Man by the_Virgin Mary , the Saviour of the world.
     I believe , therefore , that we are without exception sinners , by nature alienated from God , and that Jesus_Christ , the Son of God , came to earth , the representative Head of a new race , to die upon the cross and pay the penalty of the sin of the world , and that he who thus receives Christ as his personal Saviour is  born again  spiritually , with new privileges , appetites , and affections , destined to live and grow in His likeness forever.
   Nor can any man save himself by good works or by a commendable  moral life  , although such works are the natural fruits and evidences of a saving faith already received and naturally expressing itself through such avenues.
     I now ever look_for Christ acording to His promises and those of the Old_Testament as_well , to appear again in glory to put_away all sin and to reign in righteousness over the whole earth.
     To state fully what the Bible means as my daily spiritual food is as intimate and difficult as to formulate the reasons for loving my nearest and dearest relatives and friends.
   The Bible is as obviously and truly food for the spirit as bread is food for the body.
   Again , as faith reveals God my Father and Christ my Saviour , I follow without question where He leads me daily by His Spirit of love , wisdom , power and prayer.
   I place His precepts and His leadings above every seeming probability , dismissing cherished convictions and holding the wisdom of man as folly when opposed to Him.
   I discern no limits to a faith vested in God and Christ , who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge , and daring to trust Him even_though called to stand alone before the world.
     Our Lord 's invitation with its implied promise to all is ,  Come and see .
     I stood at the bedside of my patient one_day and beheld a very sick man in terrible pain.
   As I ministered to his needs , I noticed that his face was radiant in_spite_of his suffering and I learned that he was trusting not_only in the skill of his doctor and nurse but also the Lord.
     In his heart he had that peace of_which the Lord spoke when He said ,  Peace I leave with you , my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , give I unto you.
   Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
     What a joy to realize that we , too , can claim this promise tendered by the Lord during His earthly ministry to a group of men who were very dear to Him.
   He was about to leave them , to depart from this world , and return to His Father in Heaven.
   Before He left them He promised that His peace would be their portion to abide in their hearts and minds.
     I praise God for the privilege of being a nurse who has that peace through faith in the Lord Jesus_Christ.
   It makes my work a great_deal easier to be able to pray for the Lord 's guidance while ministering to the physical needs of my patients.
     How often have I looked_to Jesus when entering the sick room , asking for His presence and help in my professional duties as I give my talents not_only as the world giveth but as one who loves the Saviour and His creatures.
     Looking unto God , the Prophet_Isaiah wrote these blessed words almost three thousand years ago :  Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee : because he trusteth in thee .
     Are you longing for peace in your heart?
   Such a calm and assuring peace can be yours.
   As only a member of the family can share_in the innermost joys of the family , likewise one must belong_to the family of God in_order_to receive the benefits that are promised to those who are His own.
     Perhaps you are not His child.
   Perhaps you do not know if you belong to Him.
   You may know that you are in God 's family and be just_as sure of_it as you are that you belong_to the family of your earthly father.
      God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life  , and  as_many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of God , even to them that believe on his name .
     It is to those who believe on His name and belong to Him that He gives His peace ; not that empty peace the world offers , but a deep , abiding peace which nothing can destroy.
     Why not open your heart to the Lord Jesus_Christ now , accept Him as your Saviour and let Him fill you with peace that only He can give.
     Then , with the hymn writer of old , you can say :      I am resting today in His wonderful peace ,     Resting sweetly in Jesus ' control.
     I am kept from all danger by night and by day ,     And His glory is flooding my soul .
     Satellites , sputniks , rockets , balloons ; what next?
   Our necks are stiff from gazing at the wonders of outer_space , which have captured the imagination of the American public.
   Cape_Canaveral 's achievements thunder forth from the radio , television , and newspaper.
     While we are filling outer_space with scientific successes , for many the  inner  space of their soul is an aching void.
     Proof?
   An average of 50 suicides are reported in America each_day!
   One out of every three or four marriages end in divorce!
   Over $ 200000000 is paid yearly to the 80000 full-time fortune-tellers in the United_States by fearful mankind who want to  know  what the future holds!
   Delinquency , juvenile and adult , is at an all-time high!
   Further proof?
   Read your daily newspaper!
     Unfortunately , in our rush to beat the Russians , we have forgotten these truth-packed words of Jesus_Christ :  What shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world [ that includes outer_space ] , and lose his own soul?
   Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
   ( Mark 8 : 36 , 37 ).
     Gaining outer_space and losing  inner  space is bad business according to God 's standards.
     It is true that we must keep_up our national defenses and scientific accomplishments ; only a fool would think otherwise.
   But we must_not forget man 's soul.
     Is putting a rocket in orbit half so significant as the good news that God put His Son , Jesus_Christ , on earth to live and die to save our hell-bound souls?
    For God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life  ( John 3 : 16 ).
     Never forget that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
   Your spiritual  inner  space helps determine the spirituality of America as a nation.
   We trust you are not_one of the 70000000 Americans who do not attend church , but who feel that various forms of recreation are more important than worshipping the God who made our country great.
     Is forgiveness of past sins , assurance of present help , and hope of future bliss in your orbit?
   Or are you trying the_devil 's substitutes to relieve that spiritual hunger you feel within?
   Pleasure , fame and fortune , drowning your troubles with a drink , and  living_it_up  with the gang are like candy_bars when you 're hungry : they may ease your hunger temporarily , but they 'll never take the place of a satisfying , mouth-watering steak.
     So it is spiritually.
   No amount of religious_ceremonies or even joining a church will relieve the gnawing of your  inner  space.
   Why?
   Because your soul was made to be filled with God Himself , not religious functions  about  Him.
   Only He can satisfy the deepest longings.
   That is why the Bible commands you to  Taste and see that the Lord is good : blessed [ happy ] is the man that trusteth in him  ( Psalm 34 : 8 ).
     You can receive God into your heart and life by a step of personal faith.
   Accept the sinless Son of God , Jesus_Christ , as your own personal Saviour.
    
     The Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom shall I fear?
   the Lord is the strength of my life ; of whom shall I be afraid ?
     Psalm 27 : 1 A certain teacher scheduled a  Fear Party  for her fourth grade pupils.
   It was a session at which all the youngsters were told to express their fears , to get them out in_the_open where they could talk_about them freely.
   The teacher thought it was so successful that she asks :  Would n't it be helpful to all age_groups if they could participate in a similar confessional of their fears and worries ?
     Dr._George_W._Crane , a medical columnist , thinks it would.
   He says :  That would reduce neurotic ailments tremendously.
   Each_week an estimated 20 million patients call_upon us doctors.
   Of_this number , 50 % , or 10 million patients have no diagnosable physical ailments whatever.
   They are ' worry_warts '.
   Yet they keep running from one physician to another , largely to get a willing ear who will listen to their parade of troubles.
   One of the_most wholesome things you could schedule in your church would thus be a group confessional where people could admit of their inner tensions .
     We are evidently trying hard to think_of new ways to deal with the problem of fear these days.
   It must be getting more serious.
   People are giving their doctors a hard_time.
   One doctor made a careful survey of his patients and the reasons for their troubles , and he reported that 40 % of them worried about things that never happened ; 30 % of them worried about past happenings which were completely beyond their control ; 12 % of them worried about their health , although their ailments were imaginary ; 10 % of them worried about their friends , neighbors , and relatives , most_of whom were quite capable_of taking care of themselves.
   Only 8 % of the worries had behind them real causes which demanded attention.
     Well , most_of our fears may be unfounded , but after you discover that fact , you have something else to worry about : Why then do we have these fears?
   What is the real cause of them?
   What is there about us that makes us so anxious?
     Look_at the things we do to escape our fears and to forget our worries.
   We spend millions of dollars every_year on fortune_tellers and soothsayers.
   We spend billions of dollars at the race tracks , and more billions on other forms of gambling.
   We spend billions of dollars on liquor , and many_more billions on various forms of escapist entertainment.
   We consume tons of aspirin and tranquilizers and sleeping_pills in_order_to get a moment 's relief from the tensions that are tearing us apart.
     A visitor from a more peaceful country across the sea was taken to one of our amusement_parks , and after he had seen it all , he said to a friend :  You must be a very sad people .
    Sad  was not the right word , of_course.
   He should have said  jittery  , for that 's what we are.
   And that 's worse than sad.
   Watch people flock to amusement houses , cocktail_lounges , and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment , which means an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who are supposed to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give men a_few hours of dubious relaxation - watch them and you can tell that many_of them are running_away from something.
     In one of his writings Pascal speaks of_this mania for diversion as being a sign of misery and fear which man cannot endure without such opiates.
   Yes , and as tension mounts in_this world , fear is increasing.
   Does that explain why there is now such a big boom in the bomb_shelter business?
   We have so many new things to fear in_this age of nuclear_weapons , dreadful things which are too horrible to contemplate.
   I doubt that  fear parties  and  group confessionals  will help very_much.
   Suppose we do get our fears out in_the_open , what then?
   Is n't that where most_of them are already - right out on the front page of our newspapers?
   Maybe we are talking_about them too_much.
   The question is :   what are we going to do about them?
     Meanwhile , the enemy will capitalize on our fears , if he can.
   Hitler did just that 23 years ago , building_up tensions that first led to a Munich and_then to a world_war.
   The fear of war can make us either too weak to stand and too willing to compromise , or too reckless and too nervous to negotiate for peace as long as there is any chance to negotiate.
   It is said that fear in human_beings produces an odor that provokes animals to attack.
   It could have the same effect on Communists.
   The President_of_the_United_States has said :  We will never negotiate out of fear , and we will never fear to negotiate .
   That is a sound position , but it is important that Moscow shall recognize it not merely as the word of a president but as the mind of a free people who are not afraid.
   And that 's another reason why it is imperative for us these days to conquer our fears , to develop the poise that promotes peace.
     Turning_to the Word_of_God , we find the only sure way to do that.
   In Psalm 27 : 1 you read those beautiful words which you must have in your heart if you are to master the fears that surround you , or to drive them out if they have you in their grip :  The Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom shall I fear?
   the Lord is the strength of my life ; of whom shall I be afraid ?
     Well , you say , those are beautiful words all_right , but it was easy for the psalmist to sing them in his day.
   He did n't live in a world of perpetual peril like ours.
   He did n't know anything about the problems we face today.
     No?
   Read the next two verses :  When the wicked , even mine enemies and my foes , came upon me to eat_up my flesh , they stumbled and fell.
   Though an host should encamp against me , my heart shall not fear :   though war should rise against me , in_this will I be confident .
     That_is almost a perfect description of the predicament in_which we find ourselves today , is n't it?
   Our enemy is also threatening to devour us.
   He has already devoured huge areas of the world , putting men behind concrete walls and iron_curtains and barbed_wire , reducing them to slavery , systematically crushing not_only their bodies but their souls , and shooting them to death if they try to escape their prison.
   Yes indeed , we too can see a warlike host of infidels encamped against us.
     What a terrible thing , that  wailing_wall  in Berlin!
   A man with a baby in his arms stood there pleading for his wife who is on the other side with the rest of the family.
   Another man tried to swim across the river from the East to the West , but was shot and killed.
   A middle aged woman opened a window on the third floor of her house which was behind the wall , she threw_out a_few belongings and_then jumped ; she was fatally injured.
   The entrance to a church has been walled_up , so_that the congregation , most_of which is in the western sector , cannot worship God there anymore.
   Practically everybody in Berlin has relatives and friends that live in the opposite part of the city.
   People stand at the wall giving_vent to their feelings , weeping , pounding it with their fists , pleading for loved_ones.
   But the enemy answers them from loudspeakers that pour out Communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible profanity.
   There is only one escape left , a tragic one , and too many people are taking it : suicide.
   The normal rate of suicides in East_Berlin was one a day , but since the border was closed on August 13 it has jumped to 25 a day!
     These things may be happening many miles away from us but really they are right next_door.
   We are all involved in them , deeply involved.
   And nobody knows what comes next.
   We live from crisis to crisis.
   And there is only one way for a man to conquer his fears in such a world.
   He must learn to say with true faith what the psalmist said in a similar world :  The Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom shall I fear?
   the Lord is the strength of my life ; of whom shall I be afraid ?
     Notice that this man had a threefold conception of God which is the secret of his faith.
   First ,  the Lord is my light .
   He lived in a very dark world , but he was not in the dark.
   The same God who called this world into being when He said :  Let there be light !
   - those were His very first creative words - He began the world with light - this God still gives light to a world which man has plunged into darkness.
   For those who put their trust in Him He still says every_day again :  Let there be light !
   And there is light!
     In_fact , He came into this world Himself , in the person of His Son , Jesus_Christ , who stood here amid the darkness of human sin and said :  I am the light of the world : he that followeth me shall not walk in_darkness , but shall have the light of life .
   The psalmist could say that God was his light even_though he could only anticipate the coming of Christ.
   He lived in the dawn ; he could only see the light coming over the horizon.
   We live in the bright daylight of_that great event ; for us it is a fact in history.
   Why should we not have the same faith , and an even greater experience of the light which it gives?
     This is the faith that moved the psalmist to add his second conception of God :  The Lord is my salvation .
   He knew that his God would save him from his enemies because He had saved him from his sins.
   If God could do that , He could do anything.
   The enemies at his gate , threatening to eat_up his flesh , were nothing compared with the enemy of sin within his own soul.
   And God had conquered that one by His grace!
   So why worry about all the others?
     The apostle Paul said the same thing in the language and faith of the New_Testament :  He that spared not His own Son , but delivered Him up for us all , how shall He not with Him freely give us all things?
   If God be for us , who can be against us?
   Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
   shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ?
   ( Romans 8 : 31 , 32 , 35 )     Salvation!
   This is the key to the conquest of fear.
   This gets down to the heart of our problem , for it reconciles us with God , whom we fear most_of_all because we have sinned against Him.
   When that fear has been removed by faith in Jesus_Christ , when we know that He is our Savior , that He has paid our debt with His blood , that He has met the demands of God 's justice and thus has turned His wrath away - when we know that , we have peace with God in our hearts ; and_then , with this God on our side , we can face the whole world without_fear.
     And so the psalmist gives us one more picture of God :  The Lord is the strength of my life .
   The word is really  stronghold .
   It recalls those words of another psalm :  God is our refuge and strength , a very present help in_trouble.
   Therefore will not we fear , though the earth be removed , and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea.
   Come , behold the works of the Lord , what desolations He hath made in the earth.
    
    But , again , we have no real evidence on this from_that quarter until the close of the ninth century A._D. , when an Arabic scholar , Tabit ibn Korra ( 836 - 901 ) is said to have discussed the magic square of three.
   Thus , while it remains possible that the Babylonians and / or the Pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before the Chinese did , more definite evidence will have to turn_up from the Middle_East or the Classical_World before China can lose her claim to the earliest known magic square by more_than a_thousand years.
     The concept of the Middle_Kingdom at_peace , strong and united under a forceful ruler , which had been only a longed-for ideal in the time of the Warring States , was finally realized by the establishment of a Chinese Empire under the Ch ' in dynasty ( 221 - 207 B. C.
 ).
   But this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian despotism.
   Among the many severe measures taken by the First_Emperor , Shih_Huang-ti , in his efforts to insure the continuation of_this hard-won national unity , was the burning of the books in 213 B._C. , with the expressed intention of removing possible sources for divergent thinking ; but , as he had a special fondness for magic and divination , he ordered that books on these subjects should be spared.
   Many_of the latter were destroyed in their turn , during the burning of the vast Ch ' in palace some ten years later ; yet some must have survived , because the old interest in number symbolism , divination , and magic persisted on into the Han dynasty , which succeeded in reuniting China and keeping it together for a longer period ( from 202 B._C. to A._D. 220 ).
   In_fact , during the first century B._C. , an extensive literature sprang_up devoted_to these subjects , finding its typical expression in the so-called  wei books  , a_number_of which were specifically devoted_to the Lo_Shu and related numerical diagrams , especially in connection with divination.
   However , the wei books were also destroyed in_a_series of Orthodox_Confucian purges which culminated in a final proscription in 605.
     After_all this destruction of old literature , it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the Lo_Shu , which was already semisecret anyhow.
   But , in_spite_of all this , enough evidence remains to show that the magic square of three must indeed have been the object of a rather extensive cult - or series of cults - reaching fullest expression in the Han period.
     Although modern scholars have expressed surprise that  the simple magic square of three  , a mere  mathematical puzzle  , was able_to exert a considerable influence on the minds and imaginations of the cultured Chinese for so many centuries , they could have found most_of the answers right within the square itself.
   But , up_to_now , no one has attempted to analyze its inherent mathematical properties , or the numerical significance of its numbers - singly or in combination - and_then tried to consider these in the light of Old Chinese cosmological concepts.
     Such an analysis speedily reveals why the middle number of the Lo_Shu , 5 , was so vitally significant for the Chinese ever since the earliest hints that they had a knowledge of_this diagram.
   The importance of_this 5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers - quite apart from any numerological considerations , which is to say , any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it.
   Indeed , mathematically speaking , it was both functionally and symbolically the_most important number in the entire diagram.
     If one takes the middle number , 5 , and multiplies it by 3 ( the base number of the magic square of three ) , the result is 15 , which is also the constant sum of all the rows , columns , and two main diagonals.
   Then , if the middle number is activated to its greatest potential in_terms_of this square , through multiplying it by the highest number , 9 ( which is the square of the base number ) , the result is 45 ; and the latter is the total sum of all the numbers in the square , by which all the other numbers are overshadowed and in_which they may be said to be absorbed.
     Furthermore , the middle number of the Lo_Shu is not_only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers , by reason of its central position ; it is also their mathematical mean , since it is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair , all_of which equal 10.
   In_fact , the neat balance of these pairs , and their subtle equilibrium , would have had special meaning in the minds of the Old Chinese.
   For they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female , equating the two groups with the Yang and Yin principles in Nature ; and in_this square , the respective pairs made_up of large and small odd ( Yang ) numbers , and those composed of large and small even ( Yin ) numbers , were all equal_to each other.
   Thus all differences were leveled , and all contrasts erased , in a realm of no distinction , and the harmonious balance of the Lo_Shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis.
     The tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the Lo_Shu square - for purely mathematical reasons - and the fact that this number so neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe , could well explain why the Old Chinese seem to have so revered the number 5 , and why they put so_much stress on the concept of Centrality.
   These twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in the Han dynasty.
     The existing reverence for Centrality must have been still further stimulated toward the close of the second century B._C. , when the Han_Emperor_Wu_Ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow - which symbolized the Center among the traditional Five Directions - and took 5 as the dynastic number , believing that he would thus place himself , his imperial family , and the nation under the_most auspicious influences.
   His immediate motive for doing this may not have been directly inspired by the Lo_Shu , but this measure must inevitably have increased the existing beliefs in the latter 's efficacy.
     After this time , inscriptions on the Han bronze mirrors , as_well as other writings , emphasized the desirability of keeping one 's self at the center of the universe , where cosmic forces were strongest.
   Later , we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too literally.
     All this emphasis on Centrality and on the number 5 as a symbolic expression of the Center , which seems to have begun as far back as 400 B._C. , also may conceivably have led to the development of the Five-Elements_School and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical categories of five.
   We find , for_example , such groupings as the Five Ancient Rulers , the Five Sacred Mountains , the Five Directions ( with Center ) , the Five Metals , Five Colors , Five Tastes , Five Odors , Five Musical_Notes , Five Bodily_Functions , Five Viscera , and many others.
   This trend has often been ascribed to the cult of the Five Elements itself , as though they had served as the base for all the rest ; but why did the Old Chinese postulate five elements , when the Ancient Near East - which may have initiated the idea that natural elements exerted influence in human life and activities - recognized only four?
   And why did the Chinese suddenly begin to talk_about the Five Directions , when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only the usual four?
   Obviously , something suddenly caused them to start thinking in_terms_of fives , and that may have been the workings of the Lo_Shu.
     This whole tendency had an unfortunate effect on Chinese thinking.
   Whereas the primary meanings of the Lo_Shu diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties - and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested_on some mathematical bases - the urgent desire to place everything into categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers , until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded Chinese thought.
   Scholars made numbered sets of as_many things as possible in Nature , or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things , in a fashion that seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical , and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought in China for many centuries.
     Although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the Lo_Shu , and the interrelation of all the other numbers to_it , might seem enough to account_for the deep fascination which the Lo_Shu held for the Old Chinese philosophers , this was actually only a beginning of wonders.
   For the Lo_Shu square was a remarkably complete compendium of most_of the chief religious and philosophical ideas of its time.
   As_such , one cannot fully understand the thought of the pre-Han and Han periods without knowing the meanings inherent in the Lo_Shu ; but , conversely , one cannot begin to understand the Lo_Shu without knowing something about the world_view of the Old Chinese , which they felt they saw expressed in it.
     The Chinese world_view during the Han dynasty , when the Lo_Shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity , was based in large part on the teachings of the Yin-Yang and Five-Elements_School , which was traditionally founded by Tsou_Yen.
   According to this doctrine , the universe was ruled by Heaven , T ' ien - as a natural force , or in the personification of a Supreme_Sky-god - governing all things by means of a process called the Tao , which can be roughly interpreted as  the Order of the Universe  or  the Universal Way .
   Heaven , acting through the Tao , expressed itself by means of the workings of two basic_principles , the Yin and the Yang.
   The Yang , or male principle , was the source of light , heat , and dynamic vitality , associated with the Sun ; while the Yin , or female principle , flourished in_darkness , cold , and quiet inactivity , and was associated with the Moon.
   Together these two principles influenced all things , and in varying combinations they were present in everything.
     We have already seen that odd numbers were considered as being Yang , while the even numbers were Yin , so_that the eight outer numbers of the Lo_Shu represented these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center.
   During the Han dynasty , another Yin-Yang conception was applied to the Lo_Shu , considering the latter as a plan of Ancient_China.
   Instead of linking the nine numbers of_this diagram with the traditional Nine Provinces , as was usually done , this equated the odd , Yang numbers with mountains ( firm and resistant , hence Yang ) and the even numbers with rivers ( sinuous and yielding , hence Yin ) ; taking the former from the Five Sacred Mountains of the Han period and the latter from the principal river systems of Old_China.
     Thus the middle number , 5 , represented Sung-Shan in Honan , Central_China ; the 3 , T ' ai-Shan in Shantung , East_China ; the 7 , Hwa-Shan in Shensi , West_China ; the 1 , Heng-Shan in Hopei , North_China ( or the mountain with the same name in neighboring Shansi ) ; and the 9 , Huo-Shan in Anhwei , which was then the South_Sacred_Mountain.
   For the rivers , the 4 represented the Huai , to the ( then ) Southeast ; the 2 , the San_Kiang ( three rivers ) in the ( then ) Southwest ; the 8 , the Chi in the Northeast ; and the 6 , the ( upper ) Yellow_River in the Northwest.
     Note that by Western standards this plan was  upside_down  , as it put North at the bottom and South at the top , with the other directions correspondingly altered ; but in_this respect it was merely following the accepted Chinese convention for all maps.
   The same arrangement was used when the Lo_Shu was equated with the Nine Provinces ; and whenever the Lo_Shu involved directional symbolism , it was oriented in_this same fashion.
    
    Few persons who join the Church are insincere.
   They earnestly desire to do the will of God.
   When they fall_by_the_wayside and fail to achieve Christian stature , it is an indictment of the Church.
   These fatalities are dramatic evidence of  halfway evangelism  , a failure to follow_through.
   A program of Lay_Visitation_Evangelism can end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship.
     The work of Lay_Visitation_Evangelism is not completed when all_of the persons on the Responsibility_List have been interviewed.
   In the average situation about one-third of those visited make commitments to Christ and the Church.
   The pastor and the Membership Preparation and Assimilation_Committee must follow_through immediately with a carefully planned program.
   The first thirty to sixty days after individuals make their decision will determine their interest and participation in the life of the Church.
   Neglect means spiritual paralysis or death.
     Churches that have a carefully planned program of membership preparation and assimilation often keep 85 to 90 per_cent of their new members loyal and active.
   This is the answer to the problem of  membership delinquency .
     It is important that persons desiring to unite with the Church be prepared_for this experience so_that it may be meaningful and spiritually significant.
   It is unfair and unchristian to ask a person to take the sacred vows of Church membership before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications.
     Preparation for Church membership begins immediately after the commitment is_received.
     The pastor writes a personal_letter to each individual , expressing his joy over the decision , assuring him of a pastoral call at the earliest convenient time , and outlining the plan for membership preparation classes and Membership_Sunday.
   Some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is reported by the visitors.
   It should not be postponed later than the next day.
   A helpful leaflet may be enclosed in the letter.
     The pastor calls in the home of each individual or family for a spiritual guidance conference.
   If possible , he should make an appointment in_order that all persons involved may be present.
   This is not a social call.
   It is definitely a  spiritual guidance conference .
   He will discuss the significance of Christian commitment , the necessity of family religion and private devotions , and the importance of the membership preparation sessions.
   There may be problems of conduct or questions of belief which will require his counsel.
   Each conference should be concluded naturally with prayer.
   A_piece of devotional material , such_as The Upper_Room , may be_left in each home.
     A minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership is necessary for adults.
   Some churches require more.
   None should ask less.
   Those who join the Church need_to be instructed in the faith and the meaning of Christian discipleship before they take the sacred vows.
   They will have a greater appreciation for the Church and a deeper devotion to_it if membership requires something of them.
     Many churches find the Sunday_school hour to be the_most practical time for adult preparation classes.
   Others meet on Sunday night , at the mid-week service , or for a series of four nights.
   Some pastors have two sessions in one evening , with a refreshment period between.
     The sessions should cover four major areas :     The Christian_Faith History of the Church_Duties of Church_Membership The Local Church and Its Program Following each instruction period a_piece of literature dealing with the topic should be handed each one for further reading during the week.
   This procedure is much more effective than giving_out a membership packet.
     Most pastors find that the fourth session should take at_least two hours and therefore hold it on a week night prior to Reception Sunday.
   In_this session the persons seeking membership are provided information concerning the work of the denomination as_well as the program and activities of the local church.
   The lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak on the various phases of church life , service opportunities , the church school , missions , men 's work , women 's work , youth program , social_activities , and finances.
   The budget of the church may be_presented and pledges solicited at this session.
   An  interest finder  or  talent sheet  may be filled_out by each person.
   ( See sample on pp.
78 - 79.
 )   The fourth session may be concluded with a tour of the church facilities and refreshments.
   The social time gives an opportunity for church leaders to become acquainted_with the new members.
     In conducting the Membership_Preparation-Inquirers ' Class , the pastor should plan a variety of teaching techniques in_order_to develop greater interest on the part of the class.
   The following have been_found effective.
     Extend the number of classes.
   Some churches have six or more training sessions of two hours each , generally held on Sunday night or during the week.
   This gives greater opportunity for the learning process.
     Use dramatization - for_example , in discussing the Lord 's Supper or church symbolism.
     Use audio-visual aids.
   Some excellent filmstrips with recordings and motion_pictures may be secured from your denominational headquarters to enrich the class session.
     Have a  Question Box .
   Some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly.
   Urge them to write out their questions for the box.
     Use a textbook with assigned readings each_week.
     Select class members for reports on various phases of the study.
     Conduct examinations , using a true-false check sheet.
     Ask each member to write a statement on such topics as :  What Christ Means to Me  ,  What the Church Means to Me  ,  Why Join the Church  ,  The Duties of Church_Members  , etc..
     Assign a series of catechism questions to be memorized.
     Invite class members to share_in an extra period of Bible study each_week.
     Ask each new member to bring his Pledge of Loyalty to the Reception Service.
     There is a growing conviction among pastors and Church leaders that all those who come into the fellowship of the Church need preparatory training , including those coming by transfer of membership.
   George_E._Sweazey writes :  There is danger in trying to make admission to the Church so easy and painless that people will scarcely know that anything has happened .
     People appreciate experiences that demand something of them.
   Those who transfer their membership are no exception to the rule.
   For most_of them , it will be their first experience in membership training , since this is a recent development in many churches.
   Those coming from other denominations will welcome the opportunity to become informed.
     The preparatory class is an introductory face-to-face group in_which new members become acquainted_with one another.
   It provides a natural transition into the life of the local church and its organizations.
     The total process of evangelism reaches the crescendo when the group of new members stands before the congregation to declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship of the Church.
   This should be a high moment in their lives , a never-to-be-forgotten experience.
   They should sense the tremendous significance of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to Christ our Lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages.
     Every detail of the service merits careful attention - the hymns , the sermon , the ritual , the right_hand of fellowship , the introduction to the congregation , the welcome of the congregation.
   This is a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation.
   It will help to determine the attitude of the new members toward the Church.
   It can mean the difference between participation and inaction , spiritual growth and decay.
     The worship service is the natural and logical time to receive new members into the Church.
   The atmosphere for this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the worship experience.
   Psychologically the reception should be the climax , following the sermon.
     Ask the new members to meet thirty minutes before the service to complete  talent sheets  and pledge cards.
   Some denominations ask new members to sign personally the chronological membership register.
   Provide a name card for each new member.
   Outline plans for the entire service.
     Arrange a reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together.
   Sponsors may sit with them also.
     Invite sponsors or Fellowship Friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service.
     Give each new member a certificate of membership.
     Introduce each new member to the congregation , asking him to face the congregation.
     Lead the congregation in a response of welcome.
     Have a reception for new members in the parlor or social hall immediately after the service.
     Take a picture of the group of new members to be put_in the church paper or placed on the bulletin_board.
     Have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with new members as guests.
     The church is  the family of God .
   The members of the  family  are drawn_together by a common love for Christ and a sincere devotion to His Kingdom.
   Every member of the family must have a vital place in its life.
   This is no spectator-type experience ; everyone is to be a participant.
     Yet the_most difficult problem in the Church 's program of evangelism is right at this point - helping new members to become participating , growing parts of the fellowship.
   Very easily they may be neglected and eventually join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive.
     A study of major denominational membership statistics over a twenty-year period revealed the appalling fact that nearly 40 per_cent of those who joined the Church were lost to the Church within seven years.
   One denomination had a membership of 1419833 at the beginning of the period under study , and twenty years later its membership stood at 1541991 - a net growth of only 122158.
   Yet during the same period there were 1080062 additions.
   Another major church body had 4499608 members and twenty years later its membership stood at 4622444.
   During this time 4122354 new members were brought into the fellowship.
   Still another denomination had 7360187 members twenty years ago.
   During this period 7484268 members were received , yet the net membership now is only 9910741.
   These figures indicate that we are losing almost as_many as we are receiving into membership.
     This problem is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the active membership rolls each_year as_many as they receive into the fellowship.
   Studies of membership trends , even in some areas where population is expanding , show that numbers of churches have had little net increase , though many new members were received.
   Something is wrong when these things happen.
   The local  family of God  has failed its new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare.
     New members can become participating , growing members.
   But this will not happen merely through the natural_process of social life.
   It must be planned and carefully developed.
   The entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part in_this dynamic process.
     If the church has followed the plan of cultivation of prospects and carried_through a program of membership preparation as outlined earlier in_this book , the process of assimilation and growth will be well under_way.
   Those who enter the front_door of the church intelligently and with Christian dedication will not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest.
     However , it is not enough to bring persons to Christian commitment and train them in the meaning of Christian discipleship.
   When they unite with the Church they must find in_this fellowship the satisfaction of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into effective Christians.
     The Church expects certain things of those who become members.
   The new members justifiably expect some things from their church family :    
    Men need unity and they need God.
   Care must be taken neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor God with our parochial ideas about him , but with these two qualifications , the statement stands.
   The statement also points to a classic paradox : The more men turn toward God , who is not_only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on_which human unity can ultimately be established , the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another.
   To be reminded of_this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to_which religious divisions have compounded political ones , with a resultant fragmentation of the human_race.
   Massacres attending the partition of India and the establishment of the State of Israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions can engender.
   The words of Cardinal_Newman come forcibly to mind :  Oh how we hate one another for the love of God !
     The source of_this paradox is not difficult to identify.
   It lies_in institutions.
   Institutions require structure , form , and definition , and these in_turn entail differentiation and exclusion.
   A completely amorphous institution would be a contradiction_in_terms ; to escape this fate , it must rule some things out.
   For every criterion which defines what something is , at_the_same_time proclaims - implicitly if_not openly - what that something is not.
   Some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose that we do_away_with institutions altogether ; in the present context this amounts to the advice that while being religious may have a certain justification , we ought to dispense_with churches.
   The suggestion is naive.
   Man is at_once a gregarious animal and a form-creating being.
   Having once committed himself to an ideal which he considers worthwhile , he inevitably creates forms for its expression and institutions for its continuance.
   To propose that men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing that they be learned without having schools.
   Both eventualities are possible logically , but practically they are impossible.
   As much_as men intrinsically need the unity that_is grounded in God , they instrumentally require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him.
     Yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men at_odds with their fellows.
   Is there any way_out of the predicament?
   The only way that I can see is through communication.
   Interfaith communication need not be regarded_as an unfortunate burden visited upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our adversaries.
   Approached creatively , it is a high art.
   It is the art of relating the finite to the infinite , of doing our best to insure that the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not thwart God 's intent of unity among men more_than is minimally necessary.
   In a certain sense , interfaith communication parallels diplomatic communication among the nation-states.
     What are the pertinent facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history?
   I shall touch_on three areas : personal , national , and theological.
     By personal factors I mean those rooted in personality structure.
   Some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological differences at_all , but by the need of men to have persons they can blame , distrust , denounce , and even hate.
   Such needs may rise to pathological proportions.
   Modern psychology has shown that paralleling  the authoritarian personality  is  the bigoted personality  in_which insecurity , inferiority , suspicion , and distrust combine to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured if it does not exist naturally.
   Fortunately the number of pathological bigots appears to be quite small , but it would be a mistake to think that more_than a matter of degree separates them from the rest of us.
   To_some_extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be found in_all of us.
     Interfaith conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the_most unfortunate of all , for they have no redeeming features whatsoever.
   It is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must learn to recognize when it is they , rather_than pretexts for them , that are causing the trouble , and do everything possible to nurture the healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies.
     While the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial , nationalism is more variable.
   The specific instance I have_in_mind is the Afro-Asian version which has gained prominence only in_this second_half of the twentieth century.
     Emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination , the Afro-Asian world is aflame with a nationalism that has undone empires.
   No_less_than twenty-two nations have already achieved independence since World_War 2 , , and the number is growing by the year.
   As an obvious consequence , obstacles to genuine interfaith communication have grown more formidable in one important area : relations between Christians and non-Christians in these lands.
   Colonialism alone would have been able_to make these difficulties serious , for Christianity is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation of the other.
   Actually , however , this turns_out to be only part of the picture.
   Nationalism has abetted not_only the repudiation of foreign religions but the revival of native ones , some of_which had been_lying in slumber for centuries.
   The truth is that any revival of traditional and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity and Volksgeist which these young nations very_much need.
   Insofar as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways_of_life which constitute ultimate , trans-political justifications for their existence , such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in_which these traditions and ways are theirs rather_than someone else 's.
     All this works severely against the kind_of cross-cultural communication for which Christian missions stand.
   Africans and Asians tend to consider not_only missions but the local churches they have produced as centers and agents of Western culture and ideology if_not of direct political propaganda.
   The people hardest hit by this suspicion are , of_course , Christians on the mainland of China.
   But the problem extends elsewhere.
   For_example , in Burma and Ceylon many Buddhists argue that Buddhism ought to be the official state religion.
   In 1960 Ceylon nationalized its sectarian - preponderantly Christian - schools , to the rejoicing of most_of its 7000000 Buddhists and the lament of its 800000 Roman_Catholics.
   Again , India has imposed formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries , and fanatical Hindu parties are expected to seek further action against Christians once the influence making_for tolerance due_to Nehru and his followers is gone.
     The progressive closing of Afro-Asian ears to the Christian message is epitomized in a conversation I had three years ago while flying from Jerusalem to Cairo.
   I was seated next to the director of the Seventh_Day_Adventists ' world radio program.
   He said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have been available to him on Japanese radio networks , but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them.
   After returning to the United_States and raising the money , he discovered on getting_back to Japan that the hours were no_longer available.
   It was not that they had been contracted for during the interval ; they simply could no_longer be purchased for missionary purposes.
   It is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this heightening of anti-Christian sentiment.
   Ironically , these are the groups which have doubled or tripled their missionary efforts since World_War 2 , , while the more established denominations are barely maintaining pre-war staffs.
     Although I have emphasized the barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between Christians and non-Christians in Asia , the fact is that this development has also widened the gulf between certain Afro-Asian religions themselves.
   The partition of India has hardly improved relations between Hindus and Muslims ; neither has the establishment of the State of Israel fostered harmony between Muslims and Jews.
     I turn finally to several theological developments.
     Theocracy reconsidered.
   The modern_world has been marked by progressive disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state , whatever its political form.
   The American_Constitution was historic at this point in providing that  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof .
   One of our foremost jurists , David_Dudley_Field , has gone so_far as to call this provision  the greatest achievement ever made in the course of human history .
     The trend throughout_the_world 's religions has been toward a recognition of at_least the practical validity of_this constitutional enactment.
   Pakistan was created in 1947 expressly as a Muslim state , but when the army took_over eleven years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed in_part against the inability of political and religious_leaders to think their way through to the meaning of Islam for the modern political situation.
    What is the point  , Charles_Adams reports the Pakistanis as asking ,  in demanding an Islamic state and society if no one , not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves , can say clearly and succinctly what the nature of such a state and society is ?
   The current regime of President_Mohammad_Ayub_Khan is determinedly secular.
   And while the nation was formerly named  The Islamic_Republic of Pakistan  , it is now simply  The Republic of Pakistan .
     Comparable trends can be noted elsewhere.
   The new regime in Turkey is intentionally less Muslim than its predecessor.
   The religious parties in Israel have experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months.
   During the years when Israel was passing from crisis to crisis - the Sinai campaign , the infusion of multitudes of penniless immigrants - it was felt that the purpose of national unity could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties.
   Now that Israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction of tensions , the secularists are less disposed to compromise.
   And in_this country Gustave_Weigel 's delineation of the line between the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign served to provide a most impressive Roman_Catholic defense of the practical autonomy of both church and state.
   The failure at_that_time of the Puerto Rican bishops to control the votes of their people added a ring of good_sense to Father_Weigel 's theological argument.
   Everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that governments and religious institutions alike are too fallible and corruptible - in a word , too human - to warrant any claim of maintaining partnership with the divine.
     Salvation reconsidered.
   My father went as a missionary to China in a generation that responded to Student_Volunteer_Movement speakers who held watches in their hands and announced to the students in their audiences how many Chinese souls were going_to hell each second because these students were not over there saving them.
   That mention of_this should bring smiles to our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to_which attitudes have changed.
   I do not mean to imply that Christians have adopted the liberal assumption , so prevalent in Hinduism , that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit.
   Leslie_Newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the World_Council of Churches when he says ,  We must claim absoluteness and finality for Christ and His finished work , but that very claim forbids us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of_it .
   Newbiggin 's qualification on the Christian claim is of considerable significance.
   The Roman_Catholic_Church has excommunicated one of its priests , Father_Feeney , for insisting that there is no salvation outside the visible church.
   In mentioning this under  salvation reconsidered  I do not mean to imply that Roman_Catholic doctrine has changed in_this area but rather that it has become clearer to the world community what that doctrine is.
    
    When they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to  permit  the termination of the human_race by human_action , because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing , they know exactly what they mean.
   Of_course , in prudential calculation , in balancing the good directly intended and done against the evil unintended and indirectly done , no greater precision can be forthcoming than the subject allows.
   Yet it seems clear that there can be no good sufficiently great , or evil repelled sufficiently grave , to warrant the destruction of mankind by man 's own action.
     I mean , however , that the moral theologian knows what he means by  permit .
   He is not talking in_the_main about probabilities , risks and danger in_general.
   He is talking_about an action which just_as efficaciously does an evil thing ( and is known certainly and unavoidably to lead to this evil result ) as it efficaciously does some good.
   He is talking_about double effects , of_which the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly the other , but causes both ; of_which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended or not directly intended , but still both are done , while the evil effect is , with equal consciousness on the part of the agent , foreknown to be among the consequences.
   This is what , in a technical sense , to  only permit  an evil result means.
   It means to do it and to know one is doing it , but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily does and intends.
   Of_course , grave guiltiness may be imputed to the military_action of any nation , or to the action of any leader or leaders , which for any supposed good  permits  , in_this sense , the termination of the human_race by human_action.
   Certainly , in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives ,  it is never possible that no world would be preferable to some worlds , and there are in_truth no circumstances in_which the destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative .
     Naturally , where one or the other of the effects of an action is uncertain , this has to be taken_into_account.
   Especially is this true when , because the good effect is remote and speculative while the evil is certain and grave , the action is prohibited.
   Presumably , if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming , not_only must the good and the evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate , but also calculation of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken_into_account.
   There must_not only be greater good than evil objectively in_view , but also greater probability of actually doing more good than harm.
   If an evil which is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensated for by a problematic , speculative , future good , by the same token not every present , certain , and immediate good ( or lesser evil ) that may have to be done will be outweighed by a problematic , speculative , and future evil.
   Nevertheless , according to the traditional theory , a man begins in_the_midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate cosequences before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences.
   He does not expect to be able to trammel_up all the future consequences of his action.
   Above_all , he does not debate mere contingencies , and therefore , if these are possibly dreadful , find himself forced into inaction.
   He does what he can and may and must , without regarding himself as lord of the future or , on_the_other_hand , as covered with guilt by_accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not  permit  in the sense explained.
   By contrast , a good_deal of nuclear pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities , and not with the moral nature of the action to be done ; and by deriving legitimate decision backward from whatever may conceivably or possibly or probably result , whether by anyone 's doing or by_accident , it finds itself driven to inaction , to non-political action in politics and non-military action in military affairs , and to the not very surprising discovery that there are now no distinctions on_which the defense of justice can possibly be based.
     Mr._Philip_Toynbee writes , for_example , that  in_terms_of probability it is surely as likely as not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near future if the present situation continues.
   If it continues indefinitely it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will be made and that the devastation will begin .
   Against such a termination of human life on earth by human_action , he then proposes as_an_alternative that we  negotiate at_once with the Russians and get the best terms which are available  , that we deliberately  negotiate from comparative weakness .
   He bravely attempts to face this alternative realistically , i. e. , by considering the worst possible outcome , namely , the total domination of the world by Russia within a_few years.
   This would be by_far the better choice , when  it is a question of allowing the human_race to survive , possibly under the domination of a regime which most_of us detest , or of allowing it to destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish .
   Nevertheless , the consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere subtly qualified : it is  a possible result , however improbable  ;  the worst , and least probable  result ;  if it did n't prevail mankind would still be given the opportunity of prevailing  ; for  surely anything is better than a policy which allows_for the possibility of nuclear war .
   If we have not thought and made a decision entirely in these terms , then we need to submit ourselves to the following  simple test  :  Have we decided how we are to kill the other members of our household in the event of our being less injured than they are ?
   Thus , moral decision must be entirely deduced backward from the likely eventuality ; it is no_longer to be formulated in_terms_of the nature of present action itself , its intention , and proximate effect or the thing to be done.
     Several of the replies to Mr._Toynbee , without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard_to the permission of evil , succeed in restoring the actual context in_which present moral and political decisions must be made , by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in danger of_this evil.
    It is worse for a nation to give_in to evil than to run the risk of annihilation .
    I am consciously prepared to run the continued risk of ' race suicide by_accident ' rather_than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by_design.
   But I can only make this choice because I believe that the risk need not increase , but may be deliberately reduced  [ by precautions against accidents or by limiting war?
 ]    Quoting Mr._Kennan 's phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably to nuclear war , he [ Toynbee ] says that anything is better than a policy which allows_for the possibility of nuclear war .
    If asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility , most men will choose the latter .
    If Philip_Toynbee is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war , I think he is right.
   I do not accept that the choice is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war .
   Even Professor_Arnold_Toynbee , agreeing with his son , does so in these terms :  Compared to continuing to incur a constant risk of the destruction of the human_race , all other evils are lesser evils.
   Let us therefore put first things first , and make_sure of preserving the human_race at whatever the temporary price may be .
     Mr._Philip_Toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the anticipations of Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-Four , if he believed Communism was not_only evil but  also irredeemably evil  , then he might  think it right to do anything rather_than to take the risk of a communist world.
   Even a nuclear holocaust is a_little less frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying the earth until doomsday .
   No political order or economic_system is so clearly contrary to nature.
   But one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in_that sense , or a static order in_which no changes will take_place in_time , to be able truthfully to affirm the following fact : there has never been justitia imprinted in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some pax-ordo preserved by clothed or naked force.
   On their way to the Heavenly_City the children of God make use of the pax-ordo of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility for its preservation.
   Not to repel injury and uphold and improve pax-ordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice that challenges it at the moment , but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand.
   Toynbee seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social embodiment.
    I would far rather die after a Russian occupation of_this country - by some deliberate act of refusal - than die uselessly by atomisation .
   Would such an act of refusal be useful?
   He does not mean , in_fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the proposition , that  if we took the risk of surrendering , a new generation in Britain would soon begin to amass its strength in_secret in_order_to reverse the consequences of_that surrender .
   He wants to be  brutally frank and say that these rebellions would be hopeless - far , far more hopeless than was the Hungarian revolution of 1956 .
   This is not a project for regaining the ground for limited_war , by creating a monopoly in one power of the world 's arsenal of unlimited weapons.
   It is a proposal that justice now be served by means other_than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it , or preconditioned more positive means for attaining it , in_the_past.
    It is no good recommending surrender rather_than nuclear warfare with the proviso that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance by occupied peoples.
   Hope for the future would lie_in the natural longing of the human_race for freedom and the right to develop .
   This is to surrender in_advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted , to the very last ; it is to stride along the steep slope downward.
   The only contrary action , in_the_future as in_the_past , runs the risk of war ; and , now and in_the_future unlike in_the_past , any attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of_it will , by human_action , render this planet less habitable by the human_race.
   That is why it is so_very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision as to  permitted  effects , and not draw_back in fright from any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities or probabilities unrelated , or not directly morally related , to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures.
     Finally , just_as no different issues are posed for thoughtful analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth , but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination , the same thing must be said in connection with the question of_what we may perhaps already be doing , by human_action , to accelerate this end.
   We should not allow the image of an immanent end brought_about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence among others of many other of mankind 's thrusts toward we know not what future.
    
    Much more_than shelter , housing symbolizes social_status , a sense of  belonging  , acceptance within a given group or neighborhood , identification with particular cultural values and social institutions , feelings of pride and worth , aspirations and hopes basic to human well-being.
   For almost one-sixth of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow upon these values assumed as self-evident by most Americans.
     Few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure to face these realities than real_estate_brokers and home builders.
   This pressure has urged re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying their professional ethics ; it has sought new sympathy for the human aspirations of racial minority groups in_this country.
   It is not surprising that , as spokesman for real_estate interests , the National_Association of Real_Estate Boards ( NAREB ) and its local associations have sought to limit and often ignore much of_this pressure.
     How does the local realtor see himself in the context of housing restrictions based on race , religion or ethnic attachment?
   What does he conceive his role to be in_this area of social unrest?
   What ought to be , what is his potential role as a force for constructive social change?
   What social , ethical and theological insights can the church and university help him bring_to_bear upon his situation?
     Recently , a group of the faculty at Wesleyan_University 's Public_Affairs_Center sought some answers to these questions.
   Several New_England realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyers , political_scientists , economists , social psychologists , social ethicists and theologians.
   Here , in an atmosphere of forthrightness and mutual criticism , each sought to bring his particular insights to bear_upon the question of discrimination in housing and the part each man present played in it.
     For a_number_of years , Wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business_leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty and student body , attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their responsibility for public policy.
   This article presents our observations of_that session , of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them.
     Such conversation quickly reveals an ethically significant ambivalence in the self-images held by most realtors.
   Within the membership of_this group , as has been found true of men in other professional or trade associations , the_most ready portrayal of oneself to  the public  is that of a neutral agent simply serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between them.
   Professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner.
   But as conversation goes_on , particularly among the realtors themselves , another image emerges , that of considerable power and influence in the community.
   Obviously , much more_than customer expectation is determining the realtor 's role.
   Judgments are continually rendered regarding the potential buyers ' income , educational level and above_all , racial extraction ; and whether these would qualify them for  congenial  ,  happy  relations_to other people in certain community areas.
     How explicit such factors have been historically is evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases or in a review of NAREB 's Code of Ethics Article 34 in the Code , adopted in 1924 , states that  a Realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy , members of any race or nationality , or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental_to property values in_that neighborhood .
   Though the reference_to race was stricken by the association in 1950 , being an agent of such  detrimental  influences still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to avoid.
     The rationale for this avoidance was most frequently expressed in economic terms ; all feared the supposed stigma they believed would inevitably attach_to any realtor who openly introduced non-white , particularly Negro , peoples into all-white , restricted areas.
   They would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real_estate  professionals  but agitators for some kind_of  cause  or  reform  , and this was no_longer to be a  pro .
     Obviously what we are confronted with here is the identification of  professional  with narrow skills and specialization , the effective servicing of a client , rather_than responsiveness to the wider and deeper meaning and associations of one 's work.
   These men - for_the_most_part educated in our  best  New_England colleges , well established financially and socially in the community - under kindly but insistent probing , reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the people they claim to serve , or about the public responses that actually follow their occasional breach of a  client-service relationship .
     This narrow  professionalism  does not even fit the present realities of their situation , as the pressure of minorities and the power and respectability of the realtors increase.
   As our discussion continued , the inadequacy of the  client relationship  as an interpretation of their  way of operating  became evident.
   Realtors live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work , as members of social and professional organizations , as citizens and civic_leaders , as church laymen , as university alumni , as newspaper readers , etc..
   From such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that shapes his moral understanding.
     It seems to us that choices exercised by realtors in moral situations center in at_least three areas :   ( 1 ) the various ways in_which they interpret a particular social issue ; ( 2 ) their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political processes ; and , most pervasively , ( 3 ) their interpretation of who is a  real pro  , of_what it means to be a professional man in a technical , fragmented society.
     ( 1 ) Most_of the realtors minimized their own understanding of and role in the racial issue , pleading that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society.
   There is some reality to this ; the Commission on Race and Housing concluded that  there is no reason to believe that real_estate men are either more_or_less racially prejudiced , on_the_whole , than any other segment of the American population .
   But such a reaction obscures the powerful efforts made in_the_past by both NAREB and its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices.
   Also , it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment continually employed.
     Like business and university groups generally , these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions they make.
   Realtors , both generally and in_this group , have invariably equated residential integration with a decline in property values , a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension.
     Recent studies by the Commission on Race and Housing and_others , however , point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion.
   There are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated residentially without great loss of property values , the white population having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation of the Negroes ' desire for well-kept housing , privacy , etc..
   Data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial group enters it has to be assessed in_terms_of the trends in property values before the group comes_in.
   Often they are able to get_in only because the area is declining economically.
     Significantly , no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of the six volumes ( published by the University of California_Press ) that present the commission 's findings.
   No one anticipates any radical shift in_this situation , but questions concerning reading habits , the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must surely be raised.
   The role of both church and university as sources of information and settings within which the implications of such information may be explored needs consideration.
     Relevant  facts  , however , extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance of  harmonious  neighborhoods.
   Discussion of minority housing necessarily involves such basic issues as the intensity of one 's democratic conviction and religious_belief concerning equality of opportunity , the function and limitations of government in the securing of such equality , and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents of racial agitation and strife.
     ( 2 ) Realtors realize , of_course , that they are involved in an increasingly complex legal and political_system that_is opening_up opportunities for leverage on their relation_to clients as_well as opportunities for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination in housing.
   On the positive side , recent Federal action has largely undermined the legal sanction so_long enjoyed by the segregationist position ; anti-discriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted by thirteen states and , while specific provisions have varied , the tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage.
     Realtors in_attendance at the colloquium expressed interest , for_example , in Connecticut 's new housing law as setting standards of equity that they would like  to have to obey  , but in support of_which none had been willing to go on public record.
   As far as they were aware , the Connecticut_Association of Real_Estate Boards had not officially opposed the bill 's passage or lobbied in its support.
   ( This has not been the case everywhere.
   In 1957 , the Real_Estate Boards of New_York_City actively opposed the then pending private housing anti-discrimination law.
   Official reasoning :   the bill was a  wanton invasion of basic property_rights .
 )     There are sins of omission as_well as commission ; the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations , either negative or positive , plays a large part in the public acceptance of such measures and the degree to_which they may be effectively enforced.
   Judicial opinion since the Supreme_Court decision on Shelley v. Kraemer ( 1948 ) has rendered racial restrictive covenants unenforcible.
   Such a decision should have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing_industry , but there is little evidence that realtors , or at_least their associations , have repudiated the principle in such clauses.
     In the states that have passed laws preventing discrimination in the sale or rental of housing , support by real_estate associations for compliance and broadened coverage through additional legislation could help remove the label of  social reformism  that most realtors individually seem determined to avoid.
   But as_yet , no real_estate board has been willing officially to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority buyers into all-white neighborhoods.
     One of the roles of the social_scientist , ethicist or theologian in our discussions with the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work.
   But responsiveness to these opportunities presumes that all_of us judge the good as a human good and not simply as a professional , white , American good.
   Such judgments are meaningful only in_so_far as persons are members of a world , let us say a community , that embraces Scarsdale or Yonkers , but is also infinitely richer since it is all-inclusive.
     That community of all creation is , then , the ultimate object of our loyalty and the concrete norm of all moral judgment.
   Racial discrimination is wrong , then , not because it goes_against the grain of a faculty_member trying to converse with a_few realtors but because it goes_against the grain of creation and against the will of the Creator.
   Thus , moral issues concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take_on theological dimensions.
     ( 3 ) Over the years , individuals engaged in the sale of real_estate have developed remarkable unity in the methods and practices employed.
   Most realtors and real_estate_brokers talk of themselves as  professional people  with the cultural and moral values held by the traditional professions.
   But what significance attaches_to  professional  , beyond the narrow sense of skillfulness in meeting a client 's stated needs as already noted?
   Our faculty and students pressed this issue more_than any other.
     As a theologian in the group pointed_out , a professional was , before the modern period of technical specialization , one who  professed  to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use of his particular skills.
    
    If we look about the world today , we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization : science and religion.
   Science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe , the power of the atom.
   Religion , or the lack of_it , will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new_world of peace and abundance for all mankind , or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed.
   How can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge?
     We may feel pessimistic at the outlook.
   And yet there is a note of hope , because this same science that_is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision.
   We are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material , a universe that in a word is not matter but music.
   And it is in_this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith.
     To see this vision in perspective , we need first_of_all a clear idea of the magnitude of_this new power from the atom.
   You know that I could hold right here in my hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb that dropped on Hiroshima.
   It was only about the size of a baseball ; but packed in_that metallic ball there was the explosive force of 20000 tons of TNT.
   That is enough TNT to fill the tower of the Empire_State Building ; and with the availability of bombs of_that size , war became a new problem.
     Now we might have restricted the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because it is found in only a_few places in the world.
   But we had hardly started to adjust our thinking to this new uranium weapon when we were faced with the hydrogen_bomb.
   Hydrogen is just_as plentiful as uranium is scarce.
   We know that we have hydrogen in water ; water is * * f and the H stands_for hydrogen ; there is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies.
   I have calculated that if I could snap my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body , I would explode with the force of a_hundred bombs of the kind that fell on Hiroshima.
   I won n't try the experiment , but I think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let ourselves go , there would be quite an explosion.
   And_then think how little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in Delaware_Bay or in the ocean beyond.
   Salt water is still * * f , the same hydrogen is there.
   And the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in our hands today.
     Of_course , there is also an optimistic side to the picture.
   For if I knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity , I could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body I could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire United_States for some days.
   And think , if we all knew this secret and we could pool our power , what a wonderful public_utility company we would make.
   With just the hydrogen of our bodies , we could run the world for years.
   Then think of Delaware_Bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come.
   It is power with which we can literally rebuild the world , provide adequate housing , food , education , abundant living for everyone everywhere.
     Now let us see where this power comes from.
   To grasp our new view of the atom , we have to appreciate first_of_all how small the atom is.
   I have been trying to make this clear to my own class in chemistry.
   One night there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen_table , and these peas looked to me like a_little group of atoms ; and I asked myself a question : Suppose I had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body , how large an area would they cover?
     I calculated first that there are about an octillion atoms in the average human_body ; that_is a figure one with 27 ciphers , quite a large_number.
   Then I calculated that a_million peas would just_about fill a household refrigerator ; a_billion peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic ; a_trillion peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten_thousand people ; and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of Philadelphia.
     I saw that I would soon run_out of buildings at this rate , so I decided to take another measure - the whole state of Pennsylvania.
   Imagine that there is a blizzard over Pennsylvania , but instead of snowing snow , it snows peas ; so we get the whole state covered with peas , about four feet deep.
   You can imagine what it would look_like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against the houses and covering the cars ; Pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about a quintillion peas.
     But we still have a long way to go.
   Next we imagine our blizzard raging over all the land_areas of the entire globe - North_America , South_America , Europe , Asia , and Africa , all covered with peas four feet deep ; then we have sextillion peas.
   Next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole earth with peas , then we go out among the neighboring stars , collect 250 planets each the size of the earth , and also cover each of these with peas four feet deep ; and_then we have septillion.
   Finally we go into the farthest reaches of the Milky_Way ; we get 250000 planets ; we cover each of these with our blanket of peas and_then at_last we have octillion peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body.
   So you see how small an atom is and_how complicated you are.
     Now although an atom is small , we can still in imagination have_a_look at it.
   Let us focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that I swallow a magic Alice in Wonderland growing pill.
   I start growing rapidly and this calcium atom grows along with me.
   I shoot_up through the roof , into the sky , past the clouds , through the stratosphere , out beyond the moon , out among the planets , until I am over a_hundred and fifty million miles long.
   Then this atom of calcium will swell to something like a great balloon a_hundred yards across , a balloon big enough to put a football_field inside.
   And if you should step inside of such a magnified atom , according to the physics of forty years ago , you would see circulating over your head , down at the sides , and under your feet , some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs.
   These balls are moving in great_circles and ellipses , and are of_course , the electrons , the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make_up the solid structure of my finger bone.
     Since these electrons are moving like planets , you may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom.
   So you look down there and you see a tiny , whirling point about the size of the head of a pin.
   This is the atomic sun , the atomic nucleus.
   Even if the atom were big enough to hold a football_field , this nucleus is still only about the size of a pinhead.
   It is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive_charge of electricity holding these negatively_charged electrons in their orbits ; it also contains nearly all the mass , and the atomic_energy.
     You may ask what else there is , and the answer is nothing - nothing but empty space.
   And since you are made of atoms , you are nothing much but empty space , too.
   If I could put your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down , squeeze these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge , you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole was gone , you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you could see on this piece_of_paper.
   Someone has remarked that this is certainly the ultimate in reducing.
   At_any_rate , it shows us how immaterial we are.
     Now this 1920 view of the atom was on_the_whole a discouraging picture.
   For we believed that the electrons obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics ; and therefore the atom was really just a_little machine ; and in mechanics the whole is no_more_than the sum of the parts.
   So if you are made of atoms , you are just a big machine ; and since the universe is also made of atoms , it is just a supermachine.
   And this would mean that we live in a mechanistic universe , governed by the laws of cause and effect , bound in_chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely predetermined course in_which there is not room for soul or spirit or human freedom.
   And this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were agnostics or atheists.
     Then came the scientific revolution in the late 1920 's.
   A suggestion from Louis de Broglie , a physicist in France , showed us that these electrons are not point particles but waves.
   And to see the meaning of_this new picture , imagine that you can put_on more powerful glasses and go_back inside the atom and have_a_look at it in the way we view it today.
   Now as you step inside , instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets , you see waves and ripples very_much_like the ripples that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it.
   These ripples spread_out in symmetrical patterns like the rose_windows of a great cathedral.
   And as the waves flow back_and_forth and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms , you can put_on a magic hearing_aid and you hear music.
   It is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra playing a symphony.
   Harmony , melody , counterpoint symphonic structure are there ; and as this music ebbs and flows , there is an antiphonal chorus from all the atoms outside , in_fact from the atoms of the entire universe.
   And so today when we examine the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the universe , we are forced to conclude that the best word to describe our universe is music.
     The Island of Nantucket , part of the State of Massachusetts , lies about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother State.
   Some of the Island is sand and is not suitable for living.
   The Island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors ; the rest is obtained from harbor scallops.
   During about three and a half months of the year , in the summer , there are three boats that run from the mainland to the Island carrying passengers , food , and cars ; but the rest of the year only one boat is needed , which ties_up at the mainland nights and makes the trip down to Nantucket in the daytime.
   This is a fine trip , too , on a good_day.
   With Martha 's Vineyard on_one_side and the open sea on the other , it makes an excellent trip of about three hours.
    
    To_what_extent and in_what ways did Christianity affect the United_States_of_America in the nineteenth century?
   How far and in_what fashion did_it modify the new nation which was emerging in_the_midst of the forces shaping the revolutionary age?
   To_what_extent did_it mould the morals and the social , economic , and political life and institutions of the country?
     A complete picture is impossible - partly because of the limitations of space , partly because for millions of individuals who professed allegiance to the Christian faith data are unobtainable.
   Even more of an obstacle is the difficulty of separating the influence of Christianity from other factors.
     Although a complete picture cannot be given , we can indicate some aspects of life into which the Christian faith entered as at_least one creative factor.
   At_times we can say that it was the major factor.
     What in some ways was the_most important aspect was the impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation.
   As we have seen , a growing proportion , although in 1914 still a minority , were members of churches.
   Presumably those who did not have a formal church connexion had also felt the influence of Christianity to a greater or less extent.
   Many_of them had once been members of a church or at_least had been given instruction in Christianity but for one or another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse.
   The form of Christianity to_which they were exposed was for some the Protestantism of the older stock , for others the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration ; for still others , mostly of the nineteenth-century immigration , it was Roman_Catholicism , and for a small minority it was Eastern_Orthodoxy.
   Upon all_of them played the intellectual , social , political , and economic attitudes , institutions , and customs of the nation.
   Upon most_of these Christianity had left an impress and through them had had a share in making the individual what he was.
   Yet to determine precisely to_what_extent and exactly in_what ways any individual showed the effects of Christianity would be impossible.
   At_best only an approximation could be arrived_at.
   To generalize for the entire nation would be absurd.
   For_instance , we cannot know whether even for church_members the degree of conformity to Christian standards of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church_members in the population rose.
   The temptation is to say that , as the percentage of church_members mounted , the degree of discipline exercised by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general level.
   Yet this cannot be proved.
   We know that in the early part of the century many Protestant congregations took positive action against members who transgressed the ethical_codes to_which the majority subscribed.
   Thus Baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance of charges against their members of drunkenness , fighting , malicious_gossip , lying , cheating , sexual irregularities , gambling , horse_racing , and failure to pay just debts.
   If guilty , the offender might be excluded from membership.
   As church membership burgeoned , such measures faded into desuetude.
   But whether this was accompanied by a general lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know.
     What we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point_out the manner in_which Christianity entered into particular aspects of the life of the nation.
   We have already hinted at the fashion in_which Christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life.
   We will now speak of the ways in_which it helped shape the ideals of the country and of the manner in_which it stimulated efforts to attain those ideals through reform_movements , through programmes for bringing the collective life to the nation to conformity to Christian standards , and through leaders in the government.
     Throughout the nineteenth century Christianity exerted its influence on American society as_a_whole primarily through the Protestantism of the older stock.
   By the end of the century the Roman_Catholic_Church was beginning to make itself felt , mainly through such institutions as hospitals but also through its attitude towards organized labour.
   In the twentieth century its influence grew , as did that of the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration.
     The ideals of the country were deeply indebted to the Protestantism of the older stock.
   Thus  America  , the_most widely sung of the patriotic songs , was written by a New_England Baptist clergyman , Samuel_Francis_Smith ( 1808 - 1895 ) , while a student in Andover_Theological_Seminary.
   With its zeal for liberty and its dependence on God it breathed the spirit which had been nourished on the Evangelical revivals.
   The great_seal of the United_States was obviously inspired by the Christian faith.
   Here was what was called the American_dream , namely , the effort to build a structure which would be something new in history and to do so in such fashion that God could bless it.
   Later in the century the dream again found expression in the lines of Katherine_Lee_Bates ( 1859 - 1929 ) , daughter and granddaughter of New_England Congregational ministers , in her widely sung hymn , written in 1893 ,  America the Beautiful  , with the words  O beautiful for pilgrim feet whose stern impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom beat across the wilderness.
   America , America , God mend thy every flaw , confirm thy soul in self control , thy liberty in law.
   O beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears.
   America , America , God shed His grace on thee , and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea .
     The American_dream was compounded of many strains.
   Some were clearly of Christian origin , among them the Great_Awakening and other revivals which helped to make Christian liberty , Christian equality , and Christian fraternity the passion of the land.
   Some have seen revivalism and the search for Christian perfection as the fountain-head of the American hope.
   Here , too , must be placed Unitarianism and , less obviously from Christian inspiration , Emerson , Transcendentalism , and the idealism of Walt_Whitman.
   We must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind_of myth - among them Melville , Hawthorne , and Henry_James the elder , all_of them out of a Christian background.
     With such a dream arising , at_least in_part , from the Protestant heritage of the United_States and built into the foundations of the nation , it is not surprising that many efforts were made to give it concrete expression.
   A number were in the nature of movements to relieve or remove social ills.
     Significantly , the initiation and leadership of a major proportion of the reform_movements , especially those in the first_half of the nineteenth century , came from men and women of New_England birth or parentage and from either Trinitarian or Unitarian_Congregationalism.
   Several of the movements were given a marked impetus by revivalism.
   Quakers , some from New_England , had a larger share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted.
   We do_well to remind ourselves that from men and women of New_England ancestry also issued the Church of Jesus_Christ of Latter Day_Saints , the Seventh_Day_Adventists , Christian_Science , the American_Board of Commissioners for Foreign_Missions , the American_Home_Missionary_Society , the American_Bible_Society , and New_England theology.
   The atmosphere was one of optimism , of confidence in human progress , and of a determination to rid the world of its ills.
   The Hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence , although holding to original_sin and the doctrine of election , inspired its adherents to heroic endeavours for others , looked_for the early coming of the Millennium , and was paralleled by the confidence in man 's ability cherished by the Unitarians , Emerson , and the Transcendentalists.
     We should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind which arose from the kindred Evangelicalism of the_British Isles and the Pietism of the Continent of Europe - among them prison reform , anti-slavery measures , legislation for the alleviation of conditions of labour , the Inner_Mission , and the Red_Cross.
     We cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation of collective ills.
   A_few of the more prominent must serve as examples of_what a complete listing and description would disclose.
   Several were_born in the early decades and persisted throughout the century.
   Others were ephemeral.
   Some disappeared with the attainment of their purpose.
   Still others sprang_up late in the century to meet conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age.
     The movement to end Negro slavery began before 1815 and mounted after_that year until , as a result of the Civil_War , emancipation was achieved.
     Long before 1815 the Christian conscience was leading some to declare slavery wrong and to act accordingly.
   For_example , in 1693 the Philadelphia_Yearly Meeting of Friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves and in 1776 it determined to exclude from membership all who did not comply.
   In the latter year Samuel_Hopkins , from whom the Hopkinsian strain of New_England theology took its name , asked the Continental_Congress to abolish slavery.
   As we have seen , Methodism early took a stand against slavery.
   Beginning at_least as far back as 1789 various Baptist bodies condemned slavery.
     After 1815 anti-slavery sentiment mounted , chiefly among Protestants and those of Protestant background of the older stock.
   The nineteenth-century immigration , whether Protestant or Roman_Catholic , was not so_much concerned , for very_few if any among them held slaves :   they were mostly in the Northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out , or were too poverty-stricken to own slaves.
     The anti-slavery movement took_many_forms.
   Benjamin_Lundy ( 1789 - 1839 ) , a Quaker , was a pioneer in preparing the way for anti-slavery societies.
   It was he who turned the attention of William_Lloyd_Garrison ( 1805 - 1879 ) to the subject.
   Garrison , Massachusetts born of Nova_Scotian parentage , was by_temperament and conviction a reformer.
   Chiefly remembered because of his incessant advocacy of  immediate and unconditional abolition  , he also espoused a great variety of other causes - among them women 's rights , prohibition , and justice to the Indians.
   Incurably optimistic , dogmatic , and utterly fearless , in his youth a devout Baptist , in_spite_of his friendship for the Quaker poet John_Greenleaf_Whittier ( 1807 - 1892 ) he eventually attacked the orthodox_churches for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the slavery issue and in his invariably ardent manner was emphatically unorthodox and denied the plenary inspiration of the Bible.
     A marked impulse came to the anti-slavery movement through the Finney revivals.
   Finney himself , while opposed to slavery , placed his chief emphasis on evangelism , but from his converts issued much of the leadership of the anti-slavery campaign.
   Theodore_Dwight_Weld ( 1803 - 1895 ) was especially active.
   Weld was the son and grandson of New_England Congregational ministers.
   As a youth he became one of Finney 's band of evangelists and gave himself to winning young_men.
   A strong temperance advocate , through the influence of a favorite teacher , Charles_Stewart , another Finney convert , he devoted himself to the anti-slavery cause.
   A group of young_men influenced by him enrolled in Lane_Theological_Seminary and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery position.
   The majority then went_to the infant Oberlin.
   They and_others employed some of Finney 's techniques as they sought to win adherents to the cause.
   Weld contributed to the anti-slavery convictions of such men as Joshua_R._Giddings and Edwin_M._Stanton , enlisted John_Quincy_Adams , and helped provide ideas which underlay Harriet_Beecher_Stowe 's Uncle_Tom 's Cabin.
   He shunned publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame.
     Wendell_Phillips ( 1811 - 1884 ) , from a prominent Massachusetts family , in his teens was converted under the preaching of Lyman_Beecher.
   Although he later broke_with the churches because he believed that they were insufficiently outspoken against social evils , he remained a devout Christian.
   He was remembered chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition , but he also stood for equal rights for women , for opportunity for the freedmen , and for prohibition.
     The anti-slavery movement and other contemporary reforms and philanthropies were given leadership and financial undergirding by Arthur_Tappan ( 1786 - 1865 ) and his younger brother , Lewis_Tappan ( 1788 - 1873 ).
    
    Individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power were transmuted at death into awesome spirits ; they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer , even more terrible abilities.
   Their direct descendants inherited not_only their worldly fortunes , but also the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of the universe.
   Royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power.
     Thus , the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less puissant ancestors.
   But this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities.
   Since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe of living beings and dead spirits , the emperor had to use it for the benefit of the living.
   The royal ritual generated power into the other world : it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits , and bring their powers directly to bear_on the everyday affairs of the world.
   Proper ritual observance at any level of society was capable_of generating power for use in the spirit_world ; but naturally , the royal ritual , which provided unusual control over already supremely powerful divine spirits , was held responsible_for regulating the universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom.
     This is the familiar system of  cosmic government .
   The Chinese emperor , by proper observance of ritual , manifested divine powers.
   He regulated the dualities of light and darkness , Yang and Yin , which are locked in eternal struggle.
   By swaying the balance between them , he effected the alternation of the seasons.
   His power was so great that he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given_ear or been deaf_to petitions.
     In_this system , no man is exempt from obligations.
   Failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one 's family , outrages to community propriety , any departure from rigid standards of moral_excellence were offenses against the dead.
   And to offend the dead meant to incur their wrath , and thus provoke the unleashing of countrywide disasters.
   The family home was , in_fact , a temple ; and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in nature.
   The dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and in every fear.
     The common belief was that there existed one moral order , which included everything.
   The dead controlled the material prosperity of the living , and the living adhered to strict codes_of_conduct in_order not to weaken that control.
   Men believed they could control nature by obeying a moral code.
   If the moral code were flouted , the proper balance of the universe would be upset , and the disastrous result could be floods , plague , or famine.
     Modern Westerners have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material , largely because in the West the historical trend has been to deny the connection.
   Living in urban conditions , away from the deadweight of village constraint and the constrictions of a thatched-roof world_view , the individual may find it possible , say , to commit adultery not_only without personal misgivings , but also without suffering any adverse effects in his worldly fortunes.
   Basing action on the empirical determination of cause and effect provides a toughness and bravado that no powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart - plus the added liberation from the constraint of silent burial urns.
     In China , the magical system par_excellence was Taoism.
   The Taoists were Quietist mystics , who saw an unchanging unity - the Tao - underlying all phenomena.
   It was this timeless unity that was all-important , and not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality.
   The Taoists believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation ; in_other_words , they were actually an organization of magicians.
     Mahayana_Buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical concepts.
   After this form of Indian_Buddhism had been introduced into China , it underwent extensive changes.
   During its flowering in the sixth to the eighth centuries , Mahayana offered a supernatural package to the Chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested philosophical Zen morsels offered to the modern Western reader.
   Mahayana had gods , and magic , a pantheon , heavens and hells , and gorgeously appareled priests , monks , and nuns , all_of whom wielded power over souls in the other world.
   The self-realized Mahayana saint possessed superhuman powers and magic.
   The Mahayana that developed in_the_north was a religion of idolatry and coarse magic , that made the world into a huge magical garden.
   In its monastic form , Mahayana was merely an organization of magic-practicing monks ( bonzes ) , who catered to the Chinese faith in the supernatural.
     Nonmagical_Confucianism was a secular , rational philosophy , but even with this different orientation it could not escape_from the ethos of a cosmic government.
   Confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power.
   If a man lived a classical life , he need not fear the spirits - for only lack of virtue gave the spirits power over him.
   But let us not be mistaken about Confucian  virtue  ; this was not virtue as we understand the word today , and it did not mean an abandonment of the belief in magic manipulation.
   To the Confucian ,  virtue  simply meant mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rules of ritual and three thousand minor ones.
   Propriety was synonymous with ritual observance , the mark of a true gentleman.
   To live correctly in an interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive for man 's fate.
     This , in_brief , was the historical background out of_which Zen emerged.
   Promoters of Zen to the West record its ancestry , and recognize that Zen grew out of a combination of Taoism and Indian_Mahayana_Buddhism.
   But the  marvelous person  that is supposed to result from Zen exhibits more Chinese practicality than Indian speculation - he possesses magical_powers , and can use them to order nature and to redeem souls.
   Proponents of Zen to the West emphasize disproportionately the amount of Mahayana_Buddhism in Zen , probably in_order_to dignify the indisputably magical Taoist ideas with more respectable Buddhist metaphysic.
   But in the Chinese mind , there was little difference between the two - the bonzes were no_more metaphysical than a magician has_to be.
     Actually , Zen owes more to Chinese Quietism than it does to Mahayana_Buddhism.
   The Ch ' an ( Zen ) sect may have derived its metaphysic from Mahayana , but its psychology was pure early Taoist.
   This is_well evidenced by the Quietist doctrines carried_over in Zen : the idea of the inward turning of thought , the enjoinder to put aside desires and perturbations so_that a return to purity , peace , and stillness - a union with the Infinite , with the Tao - could be effected.
   In_fact , the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed by modern exponents as so uniquely characteristic of the  direct thinking  Zennist was a feature of Taoism.
   So , too , was the insistence on the relativity of the external world , and the ideas that language and things perceived by consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by pure , indwelling spirit :   the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating consciousness.
     Zen maintains that cognitive things are only the surface of experience.
   One of its features attractive to the West is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred_texts.
   One patriarch is supposed to have relegated sacred scriptures for use in an outhouse.
   But this is not the spirit of self-reliant freedom of action for which the Westerner mistakes it.
   It is simply that in Taoist tradition - as in_all good mysticisms - books , words , or any other manifestations that belong_to the normal state of consciousness are considered only the surface of experience.
   The truth - the Eternal Truth - is not transmittable by words.
   Reality is considered not_only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge , but a positive handicap.
   The technique of reality confusion - the use of paradox and riddles to shake the mind 's grip on reality - originated with fourth and third century B._C._Chinese_Quietism : the koan is not basically a new device.
     It is important for an understanding of Zen to realize that the esoteric preoccupations of the select few cannot be the doctrine of the common_man.
   In the supernatural atmosphere of cosmic government , only the ruling elite was ever concerned with a kingdom-wide ordering of nature : popular religion aimed at more personal benefits from magical_powers.
   And this is only natural - witness the haste with which modern_man gobbles the latest  wonder_drug .
   Early Chinese anchoritism was theoretically aimed at a mystic pantheist union with the divine , personal salvation being achieved when the mystical recluse united with divine essence.
   But this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers.
   The anchorite strove , in_fact , to magically influence the world of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifested his power.
   Thus , the Mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation was distilled down to a bare self-seeking , and for this reason , the mystic in Asia did not_long remain in isolated contemplation.
   As the Zen literature reveals , as soon as an early Zen master attained fame in seclusion , he was_called out into the world to exercise his powers.
   The early anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed ability to perform miracles.
     Exponents of Zen often insist that very early Zen doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism of China , and proposed instead a more mature , less credulous view of the universe.
   In support of_this , stories from the early literature are cited to show that Zen attacks the idea of supernatural power.
   But actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters were in_fact supposed to possess , as_well as the extreme degree of popular credulity :  Hwang_Pah ( O baku ) , one_day going_up Mount_Tien_Tai , which was believed to have been inhabited by Arhats with supernatural powers , met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange light.
   They went along the pass talking with each other for a short while until they came to a river roaring with torrent.
   There being no bridge , the master had to stop at the shore ; but his companion crossed the river walking on the water and beckoned to Hwang_Pah to follow him.
   Thereupon Hwang_Pah said :  If I knew thou art an Arhat , I would have doubled you up before thou got_over there !
   The monk then understood the spiritual attainment of Hwang_Pah , and praised him as a true Mahayanist.
   ( 1 )  A second tale shows still more clearly the kind_of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess :  On_one_occasion Yang_Shan ( Kyo-zan ) saw a stranger monk flying through the air.
   When that monk came_down and approached him with a respectful salutation , he asked :    Where art thou from ?
    Early this morning  , replied the other ,  I set_out from India .
    Why  , said the teacher ,  art thou so late ?
    I stopped  , responded the man ,  several_times to look at beautiful sceneries .
    Thou mayst have supernatural powers  , exclaimed Yang_Shan ,  yet thou must give back the Spirit of Buddha to me .
   Then the monk praised Yang_Shan saying :  I have come over to China in_order_to worship Manjucri , and met unexpectedly with Minor_Shakya  , and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from India , went_back through the air.
   ( 2 )  In the popular Chinese mind , Ch ' an ( Zen ) was no exception to the ideas of coarse magic that dominated.
     A closer look at modern Zen reveals many magical carryovers that are still part of popular Zen attitudes.
   To the Zen monk the universe is still populated with  spiritual_beings  who have_to be appeased.
   Part of the mealtime ritual in the Zendo consists_in offerings of rice to the spiritual_beings .
   Modern_Zen presentation to the West insists on the anti-authoritarian , highly pragmatic nature of the Zen belief - scriptures are burned to make fire , action is based on direct self-confidence , and_so_on.
   This picture of extreme self-reliant individuation is difficult to reconcile with such Zendo formulas as :  O you , demons and other spiritual_beings , I now offer this to you , and may this food fill_up the ten quarters of the world and all the demons and other spiritual_beings be fed therewith.
    
    Pope_Leo 13 , , on the 13 th day of December 1898 , granted the following indulgences :  An indulgence of three hundred days is granted to all the Faithful who read the Holy_Gospels at_least a quarter of an hour.
   A Plenary_Indulgence under the usual conditions is granted once a month for the daily reading .
   Pope_Pius the Sixth , at Rome , in april , 1778 , wrote the following :    The faithful should be excited to the reading of the Holy_Scriptures : For these are the_most abundant sources which ought_to be_left open_to everyone , to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine , to eradicate errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times .
   The American_Bishops assembled at the Third_Plenary_Council of Baltimore urged the Catholic people to read the Holy_Bible.
    We hope  , they said ,  that no family can be found amongst us without a correct version of the Holy_Scriptures .
   They recommended , also , that  at a fixed hour , let the entire family be assembled for night prayers , followed by a short reading of the Holy_Scriptures .
     Since the Catholic_Church expresses such desire that the Sacred Scriptures be read , the following taken from the Holy_Bible ( New_Catholic_Edition ) will prove a means of grace and a source of great spiritual blessing.
     Do not wonder that I said to thee ,  You must be_born again .

   St._John 1 : 12 , 13.
     You may be very religious , a good church_member , an upright , honest and sincere person ; you may be baptized , confirmed , reverent and worshipful ; you may attend mass , do penance , say prayers and zealously keep all the sacraments and ceremonies of the church ; you may have the final and extreme_unction but if you are not born again you are lost and headed for hell and eternal punishment.
   You cannot be saved ; you cannot go_to heaven unless you are_born again.
   Our blessed Lord Jesus_Christ , the sinless Son of God , who could not lie , said ,  Amen , amen , I say to thee , unless a man be_born again , he cannot see the kingdom_of_God  ( St._John 3 : 3 ).
    You must be_born again  ( St._John 3 : 7 ).
     Being convinced that salvation is alone by accepting Christ as Saviour , and being convicted by the Holy_Spirit of my lost condition , I do repent of all effort to be saved by any form of good works , and just_now receive Jesus as my personal Saviour and salvation as a free gift from Him.
     You may do as you please with God now.
   It is permitted.
   God placed Himself in men 's hands when He sent Jesus_Christ into the world as perfect God and perfect Man in one Being.
   He was then in man 's hands.
   They cursed Him.
   It was permitted.
   Men spit on Him.
   God allowed it.
   They called Him a devil.
   God withheld His wrath.
   Finally men arrested Him , gave Him a mock trial , flogged Him , nailed Him on a cross and hung Him between earth and heaven ; and God allowed it.
     You can do likewise though Christ is not bodily present.
   You can ignore Him.
   You can ignore His Book , the Bible , and His church.
   You can laugh_at His blood-bought salvation , curse His followers , and laugh_at hell.
   It is permitted.
   The eternal Christ may knock at your soul 's door , calling you to give_up sin and prepare for heaven.
   You may refuse Him , spit on Him , call Him a devil , curse Him.
   It is permitted.
   You may take His name upon your lips in oaths and curses if you so choose.
   He is in your hands - now.
     On_the_other_hand , you may seek His favor , humble yourself before Him and beg His mercy , implore His forgiveness , forsake your sins , and abandon your whole life to Him.
   He has said ,  Behold , I stand at the door , and knock : if any man hear my voice , and open the door , I will come_in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me  ( Revelation 3 : 20 ).
   The choice is up_to you.
   The latch is on your side of the door.
   The choice is yours : the revellings and banquetings of_this world or quiet communion with God ; the ever burning lusts of the flesh or the powerful victory of Holy_Spirit discipline.
   The choice is yours : God is in your hands , now.
     God has already set the day when you will be in His hands.
   What He does with you then depends_on what you do with Him now.
   Then it will be a  fearful thing to fall_into the hands of the living God  if you have abused Him in your hands.
    
    I am a magazine ; my name is Guideposts ; this issue that you are reading marks my 15 th anniversary.
     When I came_into_being , 15 years ago , I had one primary purpose : to help men and women everywhere to know God better , and through knowing Him better to become happier and more effective people.
   That purpose has never changed.
     When you read me , you are holding in your hands the product of many minds and hearts.
   Some of the people who speak through my pages are famous ; others unknown.
   Some work with their hands.
   Some have walked through pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope.
   Some are so filled with gratitude , for the gift of life and the love of God , that their joy spills_out on the paper and brightens the lives of thousands whom they have never known , and will never see.
     Fifteen years ago , there were no Guideposts at_all.
   This month a_million Guideposts will circulate all_over the world.
   Experts in the publishing field consider this astounding.
   They do not understand how a small magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale could have achieved such a following.
     To me , the explanation is very simple.
   I am not doing anything , of myself.
   I am merely a channel for something.
     What is this something?
   I cannot define it fully.
   It is the force in the universe that makes men love goodness , even when they turn_away from it.
   It is the power that holds the stars in their orbits , but allows the wind to bend a blade of grass.
   It is the whisper in the heart that urges each one to be better than he is.
   It is mankind 's wistful yearning for a world of justice and peace.
     All things are possible to God , but He chooses - usually - to work through people.
   Sometimes such people sense that they are being used ; sometimes not.
     Fifteen years ago , troubled by the rising_tide of materialism in the post-war world , a businessman and a minister asked themselves if there might_not be a place for a small magazine in_which men and women , regardless_of creed or color , could set_forth boldly their religious convictions and bear_witness to the power of faith to solve the endless problems of living.
     The businessman was Raymond_Thornburg.
   The minister was Norman_Vincent_Peale.
   Neither had any publishing experience , but they had faith in their idea.
   They borrowed a typewriter , raised about $ 2000 in contributions , hired a secretary , persuaded a_couple_of young_men to join them for almost_no pay and began mailing_out a collection of unstapled leaflets that they called Guideposts.
     Compared to the big , established magazines , my first efforts seemed feeble indeed.
   But from the start they had two important ingredients : sincerity and realism.
   The people who told the stories were sincere.
   And the stories they told were true.
     For_example , early in my life , when one of my editorial workers wanted to find_out how churches and philanthropic organizations met the needs of New_York 's down-and-outers , he did n't just ask questions.
   Len_LeSourd went and lived in the slums as a sidewalk derelict for ten days.
     That was nearly 13 years ago.
   Len_LeSourd is my executive editor today.
     Many_of you are familiar , I 'm sure , with the story of my early struggles : the fire in January , 1947 , that destroyed everything - even our precious list of subscribers.
   The help and sympathy that were forthcoming from everywhere.
   The crisis later_on when debts seemed about to overwhelm me.
     That was when a remarkable woman , Teresa_Durlach , came to my aid - not so_much with money , as with_wisdom and courage.
    You 're not living_up_to your own principles  , she told my discouraged people.
    You 're so preoccupied that you 've let your faith grow dim.
   What do you want - a_hundred_thousand subscribers?
   Visualize them , then , believe you are getting them , and you will have them !
     And the 100000 subscribers became a reality.
   And_then 500000.
   And now a_million January Guideposts are in circulation.
     With our growth came expansion into new fields of service.
   Today more_than a_thousand industries distribute me to their employees.
   They say all personnel have spiritual needs which Guideposts helps to meet.
   Hundreds of civic clubs , business_firms and individuals make me available to school_teachers throughout the land.
   They say it helps them bring_back into schools the spiritual and moral values on_which this country was built.
     Thousands of free copies are sent each_month to chaplains in the Armed_Forces , to prison libraries and to hospitals everywhere.
   Bedridden people say I am easy to hold - and read.
   Three years ago it became possible to finance a Braille edition for blind readers.
     Throughout these exciting years I have been fortunate for , although I have never offered great financial inducements , talent has found its way to me : William_Boal who so ably organizes business operations ; John_Beach who guides circulation ; Irving_Granville and Nelson_Rector who travel widely calling_on business_firms.
     Searching for the best in spiritual stories , my roving editors cover not_only the country , but the whole world.
   Glenn_Kittler has been twice to Africa , once spending a week with Dr._Albert_Schweitzer.
   Last summer John and Elizabeth_Sherrill were in Alaska.
   Van_Varner recently returned from Russia.
     Twice a month the editorial staff meets in New_York for an early supper , then a long evening of idea-exchange.
   Around the table sit Protestant , Catholic , and Jew.
   Each contributes something different , and something important : Ruth_Peale , her wide experience in church work ; Sidney_Fields , years of experience as a New_York columnist ; Catherine_Marshall_LeSourd the insight that has made her books world-famous and Norm_Mullendore , the keen perception of an advertising executive.
     There are people who travel long distances to assure my continued existence.
   Elaine St._Johns may fly in from the West_Coast for the editorial staff meetings.
   Starr_Jones gets_up every morning at five o ' clock , milks his family cow , attends to farm chores , and_then takes a two-hour train trip to New_York.
   Arthur_Gordon comes once a month all_the_way from Georgia.
     We have also seen the power of faith at_work among us.
   Rose_Weiss , who handles all the prayer-requests that we receive , answering each letter personally , has the serene selflessness that comes from suffering :   she has had many major operations , and now gets_about in a limited way on braces and crutches.
   Recently , John_Sherrill was stricken with one of the deadliest forms of cancer.
   We prayed for John , during surgery , we asked others to pray ; all_over the country a massive shield of prayer was thrown around him.
   Today the cancer is gone.
     Perhaps it is not fair to mention some people without mentioning all.
   But , you see , those who are not mentioned will not resent it.
   That is the kind_of people they are.
     Perhaps you think the editorial meetings are solemn affairs , a_little sanctimonious?
   Not so.
   Serious , yes , but also much laughter.
   Sharp division of opinion , too , and strenuous debate.
   There are brain-wracking searches for the right word , the best phrase , the_most helpful idea.
   And there is also something intangible that hovers around the table.
   A good_word for it is fellowship.
   A shorter word is love.
     Each meeting starts with a prayer , offered spontaneously by one member of the group.
   It takes many forms , this prayer , but in_essence it is always a request for guidance , for open minds and gentle hearts , for honesty and sincerity , for the wisdom and the insights that will help Guideposts ' readers.
     For you , readers , are an all-important part of the spiritual experiment that is Guideposts.
   I need your support , your criticism , your encouragement , your prayers.
     I am a magazine ; my name is Guideposts.
   My message , today , is the same as it was 15 years ago : that there is goodness in people , and strength and love in God.
     May He bless you all.
     Havana was filled with an excitement which you could see in the brightness of men 's eyes and hear in the pitch of their voices.
   The hated dictator Batista had fled.
   Rumors flew from lip to lip that Fidel_Castro was on_his_way to Havana , coming from the mountains where he had fought Batista for five years.
   Already the city was filled with Barbudos , the bearded , war-dirty Revolutionaries , carrying carbines , waving to the crowds that lined the Prado.
     And_then Castro himself did come , bearded , smiling ; yet if you looked closely you 'd see that his eyes did not pick_up the smile on his lips.
     At_first I was happy to throw the support of our newspaper behind this man.
   I am sure that Castro was happy , too , about that support.
   Diario de la Marina was the oldest and most influential paper in Cuba , with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny.
   My grandfather had been stoned because of his editorials.
   My own earliest memories are of exiles : my three brothers and I were taken often to the United_States  to visit relatives  while my father stayed_on to fight the dictator Machado.
     When it was my turn , I , too , printed the truth as I knew it about Batista , and rejoiced to see his regime topple.
   None of us was aware that the biggest fight was still ahead.
     I was full of hope as Fidel_Castro came into Havana.
   Within a week , however , I began to suspect that something was wrong.
   For Castro was bringing Cuba not freedom , but hatred.
   He spent long hours before the TV spitting_out promises of revenge.
   He showed us how he dealt with his enemies : he executed them before TV cameras.
   On home sets children were watching the death throes of men who were shot before the paredon , the firing wall.
     Castro 's reforms?
   He seemed bent_on coupling them with vengeance.
   New schools were rising , but with this went a harsh proclamation : any academic_degree earned during Batista 's regime was invalid.
     Economic aid?
   He had promised cheaper housing : arbitrarily he cut all rents in half , whether the landlord was a millionaire speculator or a widow whose only income was the rental of a spare room.
   Under another law , hundreds of farms were seized.
   Farm_workers had their wages cut almost in half.
   Of_this , only 50 cents a day was paid in cash , the rest in script usable only in  People 's Stores .
     A suspicion was growing that Fidel_Castro was a Communist.
   In my mind , I began to review : his use of hate to gain support ; his People 's Courts ; his division of society into two classes , one the hero , the other the villain.
   But most disturbing of all were the advisers he called to sit with him in the Palace ; many came from Communist countries.
     What should I do about it , I asked myself?
   I had watched Castro handling his enemies before the paredon.
   There was no_doubt in my mind that if I crossed him , mobs would appear outside our windows shouting  Paredon!
   Paredon !
     What should I do?
   I was proud of the new buildings which housed Diario now : the rotogravures , gleaming behind glass doors ; the thump and whir of our new presses.
   Here was a powerful , ready-made medium , but it could speak only if I told it to.
     Then one_day , early in January , 1960 , I sat_down at my desk , and suddenly I was aware_of the crucifix.
   It was a simple ivory crucifix which my mother had given me.
   I had mounted it on velvet and hung it over my desk to remind me always to use the power of the paper in a Christian manner.
   Now it seemed almost as if Jesus were looking down at me with sadness in His eyes , saying :      You will lose the paper.
   You may lose your life.
   But do you have any choice ?
     I knew in_that moment that I did not have any choice.
   From_that day on I began to write editorials about the things I did not think correct in Fidel_Castro 's regime.
    
    Five , four , three , two , one , fire!
   The tremendous energy released by giant rocket_engines perhaps can be felt much better than it can be heard.
   The pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the_pit of your stomach.
     Never before has the introduction of a weapon caused so_much apprehension and fear.
   Nuclear_weapons are fearsome , but the long-range ballistic_missile gives them a stealth and merciless swiftness which is much more terrifying.
     A great many writers are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear rockets.
   It is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that an attacker , in possession of such absolute power , would simultaneously destroy his opponent 's cities and people.
   With a nation defenseless before it , why would the attacker spare the victim 's people?
   Would n't the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical act of complete subjugation?
   The nation would be utterly devastated.
   The will of its people , so crucial in_time of peril , would be broken.
     Nuclear_weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction in hours or days ; and now rockets have given it the means to destroy itself in minutes.
   At this point it should be painfully obvious that cities , being  soft  , and the people within them are ideally suited to destruction by nuclear_weapons.
     However , because this vulnerability is mutual , it is to the advantage of neither side to destroy the opponent 's cities , at_least so_long as the opponent has nuclear_weapons with which to effect reprisal.
   It should be appallingly apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic.
     ICBMs have given us a capability which could be used in two different ways.
   They could be used to attack a nation 's people ( which would inevitably mean the loss of the attacker 's own people ) , or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the enemy 's military_force.
     If our national interest lies_in being able_to fight and win a war rather_than committing national suicide , then we must take a much more penetrating look at ballistic_missiles.
   We must determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves.
   We must make certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job to the missile.
     Missiles are very valuable weapons , but they also have their too little known limitations.
     Because of a missile 's ballistic_trajectory , the location of a fixed target must be known quite accurately.
   Placing missiles in submarines , on barges , railroads , highways , surface vessels and in_the_air provides them with passive protection by taking_advantage of the gravest weakness of long-range ballistic_missiles today - the extreme difficulty of destroying a mobile or moving target with such weapons.
   One must first detect a fleeting mobile or moving target , decide that it is worthy of destruction , select the missile to be fired against the target , compute ballistics for the flight , and prepare the missile for firing.
     Even if all these operations could be_performed instantaneously , the ICBM still has a time of flight to the target of about 30_minutes.
   Therefore , if the target can significantly change its location in something less_than 30_minutes , the probability of having destroyed it is drastically lowered.
     Because of_this , it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic missiles will seek self-protection in mobility - at_least until missile defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability.
     In_order_to destroy the enemy 's mobile , moving , or imprecisely located strategic forces , we must have a hunter-killer capability in_addition to our missiles.
   Until this hunter-killer operation can be_performed by spacecraft , manned aircraft appear to be the only means available to us.
     It seems reasonable that if general nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other 's citizens to cinders , we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance aircraft capable_of going_into China or Russia to find and destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us.
     Let us suppose the Russians decide to build a rail-mobile ICBM force.
   It is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such_as the B-52 or B-70 in hunter-killer operations against Soviet railway-based missiles.
   If we stop thinking in_terms_of tremendous multimegaton nuclear_weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear_weapons which may be more appropriate for most important military targets , it would seem that the B-52 or B-70 could carry a great many small nuclear_weapons.
     An aircraft with a load of small nuclear_weapons could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress all trains operating within a specified geographic_area of Russia - provided that we had used some of our ICBMs to degrade Russia 's air_defenses before our bombers got there.
   The aircraft could be used to destroy other mobile , fleeting , and imprecisely located targets as_well as the known , fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by missile.
     Why , then , are n't we planning a larger , more important role for manned military aircraft?
   Is there any other way to do the job?
     Survivability of our strategic forces ( Polaris , mobile and hardened Minuteman , hardened Atlas and Titan , and airborne Skybolt ) means that it will take some time , perhaps weeks , to destroy a strategic force.
   War , under these circumstances , cannot be one massive exchange of nuclear devastation.
   Forces will survive a surprise_attack , and these forces will give depth , or considerable duration , to the conflict.
     The forces which survive the initial attack must be_found and destroyed.
   Even mobile forces must be_found and destroyed.
   But , how does one go_about the job of finding and destroying mobile forces?
   They are not susceptible_to wholesale destruction by ballistic_missile.
     Some_day , many years in_the_future , true spacecraft will be able_to find and destroy mobile targets.
   But until we have an effective spacecraft , the answer to the hunter-killer problem is manned aircraft.
     However , the aircraft which we have today are tied to large ,  soft  airfields.
   Nuclear rockets can destroy airfields with ease.
   Here then is our problem : aircraft are vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions which a missile is totally incapable_of performing ; but the airfield , on_which the aircraft is completely dependent , is doomed by the missile.
   This makes today 's aircraft a one-shot , or one mission , weapon.
   Aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once.
     This is the point on_which so many people have written_off the aircraft in favor of the missile.
   But remember this - it is n't the aircraft which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets , it is the airfield.
   Eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on_the_ground and you have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic_missiles.
     There are four rather obvious ways to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on_the_ground :     Put aircraft in  bomb-proof  hangars when they are on_the_ground.
     Build long-range aircraft which can take_off from small ( 3000 - foot ) airfields with runways.
   If we could use all the small airfields we have in_this country , we could disperse our strategic aircraft by a factor of 10 or more.
     Use nuclear propulsions to keep our long-range military aircraft in_the_air for the majority of their useful life.
     Using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines , develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing ( VTOL ) long-range military aircraft.
     We have the technology today with which to build aircraft shelters which could withstand at_least 200 psi.
   We could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters.
     Large , long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability to take_off from 3000 - foot runways , but they would require more powerful engines than we have today.
   There is little enthusiasm for spending money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous_belief that the aircraft has been made obsolete by the missile.
     This same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft.
   One seldom hears the analogy  nuclear propulsion will do for the aircraft what it has already done for the submarine .
     If , for_some_reason such_as economy , we are not going_to develop aircraft nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency , then we should turn our effort to developing jet_engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 12 or 15 to one.
   With powerplants such_as these , vertical takeoff and landing combat aircraft could be built.
   For_example , a 12 - to-one engine would power a supersonic VTOL fighter.
   With a 15 - to-one engine , a supersonic aircraft weighing 300000 pounds could rise vertically.
   The reason that we are not going_ahead full speed to develop high thrust-to-weight engines is that it would cost perhaps a_billion dollars - and you do n't spend that sort_of money if aircraft are obsolete.
     When aircraft are no_longer helpless on airfields , they are no_longer vulnerable to ICBMs.
   If our SAC bombers were , today , capable_of surviving a surprise missile attack and because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability to strike at Russia again , and again , and again , those bombers would unquestionably assure our military dominance.
     We would have the means to seek_out and destroy the enemy 's force - whether it were fixed or mobile.
   With such a force of manned bombers we could bring enormous pressure to bear_on an enemy , and this pressure would be selective and extremely discriminating.
   No need to kill an entire city and all its people because we lacked the precision and reconnaissance to selectively disarm the enemy 's military_force.
     Our first necessity , at the very outset of war , is post-attack reconnaissance.
   In a_few years we will have SAMOS ( semiautomatic missile observation system ).
   But in the case of moving targets , and targets which have limited mobility , what will their location be when it is time to destroy them?
   What targets have we successfully knocked_out?
   A ballistic_missile cannot , today , tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful.
   What targets still remain to be hit?
   These crucial questions must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance.
   SAMOS will be hard_put to see through clouds - and to see in the dark.
     Even if this is some_day possible , there remains the 30 - minute time of flight of a missile to its overseas target.
   If the target can change its position significantly during the 30_minutes the missile is in_the_air on its way , the probability of the missile destroying the target is drastically reduced.
     Pre-attack reconnaissance is vital but only post-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate the war favorably.
   It would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather that post-attack reconnaissance.
   It could operate under the clouds and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night.
     It would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately destroy any targets it discovered - no need to wait for a missile to come all_the_way from the United_States with the chance that the target , if it were mobile , would be gone.
     A large aircraft , such_as the B-52 or B-70 , could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small nuclear_weapons.
   Few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive power will create 1000 psi overpressure at 100 feet.
   Or put another way , the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed by placing a one-kiloton warhead ( 1 20 th the size of those used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki ) within 100 to 200 feet of the target!
     It is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large yield nuclear_weapons.
     Today we have side-looking radar which has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual buildings , runways , taxi-ways , separate spans of bridges , etc..
   With these keen  eyes  and small nuclear_weapons delivered with accuracy , military_forces can be directly attacked with minimum damage to urban_areas.
     If we fail to develop the means to hunt_down and destroy the enemy 's military_force with extreme care and precision , and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace , our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening.
    
    At the Westminster_KC Dog_Show in Madison_Square_Garden , New_York on the second day , the Finals of the Junior_Class brought_out the_most competitive competition in the history of_this Class.
   The Class had entries from as far west as Wisconsin and as far south as Kentucky.
   This year several entries from Canada were entered which made the Junior_Class International.
     Forty-six of the 53 Juniors who mailed in entries were present.
   It was interesting to note that many_of these Juniors were showing dogs in various other classes at the show prior to the Finals of the Junior_Class.
     As has been the custom for the past several years , John_Cross , Jr. , Bench_Show_Chmn. of Westminster , arranged for the Juniors ' meeting before the Class , and invited two speakers from the dog world to address them.
   Over 60 Juniors , parents and guests attended.
     After the Juniors were welcomed and congratulated for qualifying for the Finals of the Junior_Class , Mrs._William_H._Long , Jr. was introduced as the first speaker.
     In her opening remarks Mrs._Long also welcomed the Juniors and stated ,  There is n't any other show quite like Westminster.
   I know because this is my 37 th year with hardly_a break.
   Mrs._Long still feels the same unique spirit of Westminster which she stated the present Juniors will experience today but probably will not appreciate in full for a_number_of years.
     Twenty years ago her daughter Betsey_Long , then 13 years of_age , won the Grand_Challenge_Trophy , Children 's Handling Class ( as they were_called then ) at Westminster.
   No sooner had Betsey come_out of the ring than Mrs._Long walked into the Working Competition with Ch. Cadet or Noranda , another home-bred product , and won!
     Speaking from long years of experience , Mrs._Long advised the Juniors :  When showing dogs ceases to be fun and excitement , Stop!
   Dogs have a way of sensing our feelings!
   When you and your dog step into the Junior ring , it should be just what the dog wants to do as much_as what you want him to do.
   If you walk into the ring because it is fun to show your dog , he will feel it and give you a good performance!
   He knows your signals , what is expected of him and the way the Class is conducted , right up through the flash-bulbs of the photographers .
      Take_away your attitude  , said Mrs._Long ,  and what have you left?
   Either a nervous dog because you are livid with rage - a sure sign that you are taking things too seriously and had_better stop!
   Or a bored dog because you are more interested in something else - maybe the way you look , or the date you have after the Class , or you are just doing this to please the parents.
      The reason you are in the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the_most attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can produce.
   Aids sounds more like a Pony_Club , or horsemanship classes - riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar!
      Your aids are your attitude , which comes through your voice , your hands and legs - voice to encourage , discourage or whatever the need may be ; hands to guide or restrain ; legs to produce motion and rate of speed.
   Without right attitude the other aids just do not work right .
     Mrs._Long wished all the Juniors luck in the Class and stated ,  Have fun!
   And may you all continue to show at Westminster in the years to come !
     The second speaker was Harvey_Barcus , President of the Dog_Writers Ass ' n of America.
     Mr._Barcus spoke on the subject of scholarships for Juniors - with which he is very familiar.
   Last year a boy he knows and helped in Journalism won the Thoroughbred_Racing Ass ' n Scholarship which is worth $ 10000.
   He gave a resume of the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship.
      Junior Showmanship is an extremely worthy project and should be earnestly encouraged !
 is one of Mr._Barcus ' strong_beliefs.
   He feels very forcibly that the American_Kennel_Club should take a more active part in encouraging the Junior Division!
     In closing , Mr._Barcus also wished all the Juniors luck in their Class.
     Instead of 3 a. m. in_the_past , the Juniors_Class at Westminster was held at 4 : 45 p. m..
   This gave the Juniors the use of the entire ring at the show - a great advantage to them!
     Before the Juniors entered the ring the Steward announced that after_all Juniors had moved their dogs around the ring and set them up , they could relax with their dogs.
   From there on , each Junior was going_to be judged individually.
   This thoughtful gesture was well received by the Juniors as the Class had an entry of 46 Juniors and it took approximately one hour , 45 minutes to judge the Class.
     This year Anne_Hone_Rogers , outstanding Handler , judged the Class.
   This is the third time in 28 years of Junior Showmanship at Westminster that a lady Handler has judged the Class.
     As the Juniors entered the ring , Mr._Spring , the announcer , stated over the public-address system that this was the 28 th year that Westminster has held the Finals of the Junior Competition.
   Juniors competed last year at American_Kennel_Club and Canadian Kennel_Club recognized shows to be eligible to compete in_this Class - the Finals for the year.
   A Junior who won two or more wins in_the_Open Class was eligible.
     ( The purpose of the Junior Showmanship Competition is to teach and encourage Juniors to become good sportsmen.
   Many adults showing at Westminster today are products of_this Class.
 )     It seemed an almost impossible job for Miss_Rogers to select 4 winners from the 46 Juniors entered.
   A large_number of these Juniors have 7 and 8 wins to their credit and are seasoned campaigners.
     After the judge moved all the dogs individually , she selected several from the group and placed them in_the_center of the ring.
   She then went_over them thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship.
     Betty_Lou_Ham , age 16 , Holyoke , Mass. , showing an Irish_Setter , was chosen as International_Champion of the year.
   She was_awarded the Professional_Handlers ' Ass ' ns ' Leonard_Brumby , Sr._Memorial_Trophy ( named for the founder-originator of the Junior_Classes.
 )     Betty is 16 years of_age and had several wins to her credit last year.
   In_addition to showing an Irish_Setter throughout the year , she also scored with an Afghan.
     Sydney_Le_Blanc , age 15 , Staten_Island , N._Y. , showing a Doberman_Pinscher , was 2 nd.
     Susan_Hackmann , age 14 , from Baltimore , Md. , showing a Dachshund , was 3 rd.
   Last year Susan also placed 3 rd in the Finals at Westminster.
   From the records we keep - Susan is the only Junior who has placed in the Junior_Classes in both United_States and Canada.
     Karen_Marcmann , age 16 , Trapp , Penna. , showing a Keeshond was 4 th.
     Most Juniors who were entered in the Finals are seasoned campaigners and not_only show and win in Junior_Classes but score in the Breed Classes as_well.
     In 1960 , there were 7287 entries in the Junior_Classes.
   Each_year these shows have increased in entries.
   Next year 1962 , at Westminster , the Bench_Show_Committee has raised the requirements so_that a junior must win 3 or more junior_classes in_the_open division only to qualify for Westminster.
     Percy_Roberts , a leading judge will not be at the International_Show this year for the Junior Judging Contest as he has been invited to judge in Australia in March.
     It has been suggested many_times that a Class be set_up for the Juniors who are overage and cannot enter the Junior_Classes.
   For_some_time this writer has been suggesting a Junior Judging Class for Intermediates over 16 and under 20 years of_age who are ineligible to compete in the Junior_Class.
     Such a Class was tried_out successfully at the Westchester_KC_Show recently.
   Not_only were the contestants pleased with the Class , but it aroused the interest of all_in attendance that day.
   The Intermediates in the Class with the Judge were asked to pick 4 winners and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice of the Judge.
     We suggested this Class in the horse world and it was accepted immediately and included in the programs of horse_shows At the recent horse_show convention in New_York it was stated that this Intermediate_Judging_Class is meeting_with great success and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world.
     This Class can be just_as successful in the dog world if it is given a chance.
   Last year Robert_Harris , a leading Junior Handler entered the Dog_Judging_Contest ( Junior ) at the International_KC of Chicago show and had the highest score in judging of any Junior since the Class ' inception.
   Juniors who attend this Chicago show should make a point to enter this Class as it would be of great help to them.
     Superintendents at dog_shows state it is becoming more difficult to obtain a licensed Handler to Judge Junior Showmanship Competition.
   The founder of the Junior Showmanship Competition the late Leonard_Brumby , Sr. ( for whom the trophy is named after at Westminster ) was an outstanding Handler and believed a Junior should have an opportunity to exhibit in a dog_show starting with the Junior Showmanship Division.
     Some years ago this Class was judged by celebrities who knew nothing of_what was required of a Junior 's ability to show a dog.
   To overcome this unfair judging , the A._K._C. requires that a licensed Handler be present to judge the Class.
   If the superintendents do not receive more cooperation from Handlers , it has been suggested that licensed Judges also be qualified to judge this Class.
   By recognizing and helping Juniors get interested in the dog world , all will be helping to create future dog owners.
     The Airedale_Terrier Club of America and the Kerry_Blue_Terrier Club of America have under_consideration donating trophies to the boys or girls who win with their breeds in Junior Showmanship Competition at any Show.
   The Kansas_City and the Topeka KCs are arranging that Juniors who win at their shows will be qualified to win points for Westminster.
   The Rio_Grande KC is also considering having their Junior_Classes set_up so_that Juniors can qualify with points for Westminster.
     The American_Pointer_Club is still continuing to donate a trophies to Juniors who win at Junior Showmanship Classes with Pointers.
     Traveling through the South - over 16000 miles - with two Great_Danes , an Afghan , and a Persian kitten , we 've worked_up a regular routine for acceptance at motels.
     My husband enters the motel office , signs_up for a room , and them solemnly asks the proprieter if he accepts pets.
    Puppies ?
 comes the suspicious question.
    No  , he replies ,  full grown , adult show dogs , housebroken , and obedience-trained .
     We 've never been refused!
     Once settled , we 're careful to walk the dogs in an out_of_the_way spot , keep them under_control in the room , and feed and bench them where they can n't do any harm to the furnishings or the furniture.
     In the morning we leave the room looking as neat as a pin!
     Many_a motel owner - when we 've stopped there again - has remembered us and has said he preferred our dogs to most children.
     So many_times I have wondered why veterinarians do not wipe the table clean before each new canine patient is placed on_it for examination.
   Is it that they do n't care?
   Are they indifferent_to the fact that the dog can easily pick_up germs from the preceding patient?
    
    At_one_time , to most Americans , unless they were fortunate enough to live near a body of navigable water , boats were considered the sole concern of fishermen , rich people , and the United_States Navy.
     Today the recreational boating scene is awash with heartening statistics which prove the enormous growth of_that sport.
   There are more_than 8000000 recreational boats in_use in the United_States with almost 10000000 the prediction for within the next decade.
   About 40000000 people participated in boating in 1960.
   Boating has become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining sea.
   Boats are operated in every state in the Union , with the heaviest concentrations along both coasts and in_the_Middle West.
     The spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly evident , expectedly , in the areas where boats have always been found : the natural lakes , rivers , and along the nation 's coastline.
   But during the last several years boats were launched in areas where , a short_time ago , the only water to be found was in wells and watering troughs for livestock.
     Developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources control program of the government , vast , man-made bodies_of_water represent a kind_of glorious fringe_benefit , providing boating and fishing havens all_over the country.
     No_matter_how determined or wealthy boating lovers of the Southwest had been , for_example , they could never have created anything approaching the fifty square-mile Lake_Texoma , located between Texas and Oklahoma , which resulted when the Corp of Army_Engineers dammed the Red_River.
   In 1959 , according to the Engineers , Lake_Texoma was only one of thirty-two artificial_lakes and reservoirs which were used for recreation by over 1000000 persons.
     Where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been created by bringing bodies_of_water to the people , means have been found to take the people and their boats to the water.
   Providing these means are_about ninety companies which manufactured the estimated 1800000 boat trailers now in_use.
   It is a simple task to haul a boat fifty or one_hundred miles to a lake or reservoir on the new , light , strong , easy-to-operate trailers which are_built to accommodate almost any kind_of small_boat and retail from $ 100 to $ 2000.
   The sight of sleek inboards , outboards , and sailboats being wheeled smartly along highways many miles from any water is commonplace.
     Boatmen lucky enough to have facilities for year ' round anchorage for their craft , will recall the tedious procedure of loading their gear into the car , driving to the water , and making trip after trip to transfer the gear to the boat.
   Today , the boat , on its trailer , is brought to the gear and loaded at the door.
   Arriving_at the waterside , the boat is launched , the family taken aboard and , that easily , another day afloat is begun.
     And trailers for boats are not what they started_out to be ten years ago.
   This year , Americans will discover previously unheard of refinements in trailers that will be exhibited in about one_hundred of our nation 's national , regional and local boat shows.
   The boats of America 's trailer sailors in 1961 will be coddled on clouds as they are hauled to new horizons.
     The variety of craft on the country 's waters today is overwhelming.
   They range from an eight-foot pram , which you can build yourself for less_than $ 50 , to auxiliary sailboats which can cost over $ 100000.
   Boat prices vary according to the buyer 's desires or needs.
   In_this respect , boats can be compared with houses.
   There is no limit to what you can spend , yet it is easily possible to keep within a set budget.
   There is no question as to just what is available.
   You name it , our industry is producing it , and it probably is made in different models.
     There are canoes ideal for fishing in protected waters or for camping trips.
   There are houseboats which are literally homes afloat , accommodating whole families in comfort and convenience.
   You can cross an ocean in a fully equipped craft , sail , power , or both , or laze away a fine day in a small dinghy on a local pond.
     You may have your boat of wood , canvas , plywood , plastic , or metal.
   You may order utility models , inboard or outboard , with or without toilets , galleys , and bunks.
   You may dress it up with any number of accessories or keep it as simple as you choose.
     Designers and manufacturers have produced models for purchasers who run the gamut from a nautical version of the elderly Pasadena lady who never drove more_than five miles an hour on her once-a-month ride around the block , to the sportiest boatman who insists on all the dash , color , flair and speed possible to encompass in a single boat.
   You pay your money and you take your choice.
     American technology in engine and hull design is largely responsible_for the plentiful interest in American boating.
   I wonder if anyone ever bothered to make the point that when it comes_to boats and their motors , Americans excel over any country in the world in_the_long_run.
     Russia , whose technology is not_quite primitive , is still in the dark_ages when it comes_to improving the outboard_motor , for_instance.
     Now here is truly a marvel.
   The outboard engine of today has a phenomenal range of one to 80 horsepower , unheard of a_few years ago for a two cycle engine in quantity production.
   These engines can be removed from a boat with relative ease , wherein lies their greatest advantage.
   Their cost is not beyond the hopes of the American pocketbook , the range being about $ 150 to $ 1000 , depending_on size.
     Great thought has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population of the country ; and to making the owning of a boat simpler.
   There was a time when , if a man wanted to purchase a boat , it was necessary for him to be able to produce a sizeable amount of cash before he could touch the tiller or wheel.
   Having a boat financed through a local bank is done much the same way as an automobile loan is extended.
   Marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in non-dealer areas cooperate in enabling you to launch now and pay later.
     Terms range from one to five years and the interest_rates and down_payments run about the same as for automobiles.
   Of_course , individual financing arrangements depend a good_deal on the purchaser 's earning power , credit rating and local bank policy.
     Outboard_motors , insurance , and boat repairs may also be financed in the same way as boats.
   Terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those for home_appliances.
     When the automobile was in its embryonic stage , such roads as existed were pretty_much open roads with the tacit understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about the only rule governing where , when and_how fast a car could go.
   When air_travel was in its infancy , the sky was considered big enough and high enough for all.
   Man had enough to worry about managing to get up there and stay without being burdened with rules once aloft.
   It was much the same with pleasure boating at_first.
   Come one , come all , the water 's fine!
     As the ungoverned days of the automobile and the airplane are long_since relegated to the past , so is the carefree attitude toward what a boatman may and may_not do ; must and should do.
   However , there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating.
     Laws on boating vary according to the state in_which the craft is to be used and according to its horsepower.
   What may be acceptable in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary_line.
   The main requirement is to be sure the boat is numbered according to the regulations of the state in_which the boat will be principally used.
   If your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure_boats , you must apply for a number from the U._S._Coast_Guard for any kind_of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more_than 10 horsepower before it can be used on Federal waterways.
     State numbering laws differ from each other in many ways.
   Fees are not the same and some states do not require certain craft , such_as sailboats with no power , to be registered at_all.
   Many states have laws regulating the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age of motor boat operators.
     Generally , states reserve for communities the right to have local ordinances regulating speed and other activities.
   It is always wise_to consult your marine dealer , local yacht or boat club secretary , or local law_enforcement officers if you are not positive what the regulations are.
   Ignorance of the law is no better excuse on the water than it is on land ; lack of ability and common_sense can lead to just_as much tragedy.
     Hand_in_hand with the legislative program is the industry 's self originated and directed safety program.
   Foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the rapid_growth of the sport , the industry has been supporting an intense , coordinated educational program with great success since 1947.
     A primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers.
   The industry has been its own watch dog.
   With U._S._Coast_Guard cooperation , the American_Boat and Yacht_Council was formed to develop recommended practices and standards for boats and their equipment with_reference_to safety.
     Industry interest in safety goes even farther.
   In 1959 , the Yacht_Safety_Bureau was reorganized by the National_Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers and a group of insurance underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and labeling service for boats and their equipment.
   A new waterfront site for the bureau is now being built at Atlantic_City , New_Jersey , to provide the_most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the sport safe.
     In_addition to these activities , the NAEBM , with headquarters at 420 lexington Avenue , New_York_City , as_well as other associations and individual manufacturers , provide and distribute films , booklets , and public_services in regard_to proper boat handling and safety afloat.
     It is important to note the work of the United_States Power_Squadrons and the U._S._Coast_Guard_Auxiliary.
   Each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in seamanship piloting and small_boat handling.
   These are not governmentally subsidized organizations.
   This year , over 100000 persons will receive this free instruction.
     As America on wheels was responsible_for an industry of motor courts , motels , and drive-in establishments where you can dine , see a movie , shop , or make a bank_deposit , the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries designed especially to accommodate them.
   Instead of motels , for the boatman there are marinas.
     The word marina was coined by NAEBM originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational boats could find protection and basic needs to lay_over in relative comfort.
   Currently , marina is used to indicate a municipal or commercially operated facility where a pleasure_boat may dock and find some or all_of the following available : gasoline , fresh water , electricity , telephone_service , ice , repair facilities , restaurants , sleeping accommodations , a general_store , and a grocery_store.
     Yachtel , a relatively new word , indicates a waterfront type of hotel where a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises as_well as other services.
   Boatel has a similar meaning to yachtel.
   It indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such_as outboards.
   Regardless_of nomenclature , yachtels and boatels are marinas.
     Boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities may rightfully be called marinas.
     A recent survey disclosed there are about 4000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and boatyards in the United_States , the majority of_which are equipped to handle outboard boats.
    
    The design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical puzzle , but once understood , the principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement.
   In the frame are two sets of bars which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous moves.
   The main set of bars are the  tappets  and one tappet is connected to each lever.
   If the lever is pulled to clear a signal or move a switch , the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at_the_same_time.
     Close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking bars.
   These can also move a short distance but at right_angles to the tappets.
   The number of locking bars required depends_on how many false moves must be prevented.
     In the sides of the tappets are notches with sloping sides , and connection between the tappets and locking bars consist_of cams called  dogs .
   Two or more dogs are mounted on each locking bar.
   These slide into and out of the notches in the tappets as the tappets are moved , locking and unlocking them.
     Here 's how the scheme works : Suppose the operator pulls the lever to clear a particular signal.
   This also pulls the tappet connected to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches to_the_side , thus moving one or more locking bars.
   The dogs on the other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other tappets.
   By this scheme , pulling one signal to clear locks all the other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal is again restored to normal.
     Interlocking signals are normally at stop or  red  position , and a lever must be pulled to  clear  the signal.
   This is not necessarily to green , however , for in some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it into the  plant .
     There are other basic rules.
   A turnout may have two levers , one to actually move the switch points , the other to lock the points.
   A signal cannot be cleared until all the related turnouts are properly thrown and locked.
   Such locks are nearly always used where the switch points  face  oncoming traffic.
   The lock insures that the points are thrown all_the_way with no chance that a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point.
   If the points are n't thrown all_the_way , the turnout cannot be locked , and in_turn , the signal cannot be cleared.
   Generally , these locks on turnouts are_called  facing point locks .
     Figs. 1 - 6 show typical arrangements of track and signals.
   Each diagram is accompanied by a  dog chart  , a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular lever will lock if pulled.
   The lines connecting the wedge-shaped dogs represent the locking bars at right_angles to the tappet bars.
     By studying the track-signal diagrams you 'll note several other details.
   Derails - mechanical track devices that actually guide the wheels off the rails if a train passes a  stop  signal - are used in many instances.
    Home  signals have two blades.
   The blacked-in blades indicate a fixed aspect - the blade does not move.
   As an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal is seen in_advance when he passes the  distant  signal located beyond the limits of the interlocking plant.
   In some low-speed situations , the distant signal is_fixed at caution.
   In other instances where there is no automatic block signaling , the distant has only green and yellow aspects.
     So_much for the prototype.
     The interlocking frame we built at the Model Railroader workshop and_then installed on Paul_Larson 's railroad follows the Fig. 1 scheme and is_shown beginning in Fig. 7 , page 65 , and in the photos.
   Here 's how it can be built.
     The sizes of pieces needed for the interlocking frame are_shown in the notes within Fig. 7 , most_of the bars being 1 8  brass in 1 4  and 1 2  widths.
   You may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers and locks as you wish.
   Our instructions assume you are building this particular frame , which is for a junction.
     When cutting the pieces , dress the ends smooth , and square with a smooth file or sanding disk.
   Start with the right-hand piece  B  , * * f , soldering it to the lower piece  A  of the same material but 12  long.
   Let exactly 1  of  A  extend beyond  B  and use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees.
     Now lay 12 pieces of * * f cut 5 - 3 4  long side_by_side but separated by 12 pieces of the same material 1 2  sq..
   This gives you the spacing for locating the left-hand piece  B .
   Compress the assembly when you make the mark to show the location for  B .
   Solder this second  B  to  A  at right_angles.
   There should be 10  between the two parallel members and each should be 1  from an end of the long piece.
     Cap this assembly ( with spacing bars in_place ) with a * * f bar.
   Tack solder all the 1 2  sq. pieces to the 10  and 12  members.
   These will be drilled and tapped later_on.
     Now cut five * * f locking bar spacers ( which run horizontally ).
   Position these using six intermediate temporary * * f spacers and locate the upper 12  bar  A .
   Solder it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame.
   Now place 12 pieces 1 2  sq. on this edge as we did before and space them with the 5 - 3 4  long  tappets  , as they are called.
   Cap with a * * f bar and tack solder in_place.
   Cap the locking bar spacers with two * * f directly under the first two  B  pieces.
   Remove all the loose spacing bars.
     Mark and center-punch all the holes required for screws to hold this assembly together.
   See Fig. 7.
   Placement of these holes is not critical , but they should be located so_that the centers are about 1 8  from any edge.
   Drill all No. 50 and counter-drill all except the  A  pieces size 43.
   Tap the  A  pieces 2 - 56.
     Now unsolder and disassemble the frame except for the two 12  and the first two 3 - 3 4  bars (  A  and  B  pieces ) , which are soldered together.
   Either lay the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters so they may be replaced in their proper positions.
   Dress all surfaces with a file , cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs.
     Drill 20 No. 47 holes in the upper piece  A  as shown in Fig. 7.
   Tap these 3 - 48 for mounting the electrical_contact later_on.
   Note 6 and 8 lock levers do n't require holes for contacts.
     Now reassemble the frame , using * * f roundhead steel screws and nuts.
   Put the 12 tappets and some * * f locking bar spacers in the frame to help align all the components before you tighten the screws.
   Be sure the tappets are not pinched by a twisted 1 2  sq. spacer.
   As an anchor for the spring lock , insert a * * f bar in the lower left corner of the frame as shown in Fig. 7.
   Drill a No. 43 hole through the pieces and secure with a 2 - 56 nut and screw.
   Drill two No. 50 holes , one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly above it , and tap 2 - 56.
   Number all the tappet bars before removing them so they can be replaced in the same slots.
   Remove all other loose pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth.
   Cut five pieces of * * f brass bar stock 3 - 3 4  long.
   These are supporting members for the short locking bars.
   Locate their positions in Fig. 7 and drill No. 43 to match the corresponding holes in the frame.
   Cut_off excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut.
   Drill four No.
19 and four No. 28 holes in the 12  long  A  pieces.
   Locate the position from Fig. 7.
     Draw file No. 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective slot and square the ends.
   Break the end corners with a slight 45 degree chamfer.
   Drill a No. 50 hole 1 - 1 4  from one end and tap 2 - 56.
   ( See Fig. 7.
 )   Put a 2 - 56 roundhead screw into the hole , cut_off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar.
   To find the other stop screw position , insert the tappet into the frame and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge.
   Scribe a line across the bar on the other end of the tappet , 1 4  plus half the diameter of the 2 - 56 screw head ( about 5 64  ) away from the frame edge.
   Total distance is about 21 64 .
   Tend to make this dimension slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly 1 4  tappet movement.
   Drill a No. 50 hole , tap 2 - 56 and insert a roundhead 2 - 56 screw as you did on the first end.
   Drill a No. 47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in Figs. 7 and 8.
   Repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet bars.
     To each tappet except 6 and 8 , solder a * * f piece of brass and file to the tapered shape shown in Figs.
6 and 8.
   These will serve as lifting pads for the electrical_contacts.
     Fitting the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job since stop screws , tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced many_times.
   As the work progresses the frame and moving parts become a sort_of Chinese_puzzle where several pieces must be removed before the part you are working_on is accessible.
   A_little extra work here will pay_off with a smooth , snug-fitting machine when you are finished.
   Each completed locking bar should remain in_place as the work progresses to insure snug fitting.
     The order of fitting is not too important.
   However , we started with the first row of bars and worked our way back.
   Since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs and notches is used throughout , we will only describe the construction of one locking bar.
   Figs.
7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions.
   All the bars are cut from * * f brass.
   The lengths of each piece are listed at the bottom of Fig. 7.
   Bar  C  is 2 - 3 4  long.
   Draw file the edges , square_up the ends and put a slight chamfer on the edges so they will not snag in the frame.
     Fig. 8 gives the dimensions for locating the dog-pin holes.
   Center-punch and drill the No. 31 hole 7 16  from one end of the bar.
   Chuck a length of 1 8  dia. drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning device and while it is rotating file the end square and_then file a slight taper 1 8  long.
   Cut the piece about 9 32  or 5 16  long and drive it into the No.
31 hole drilled in the locking bar.
   File the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 1 8  above the bar.
   This dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3.
     Place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3.
   Scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of tappet 3 , parallel to piece  A .
   See the drawings for the shape of the notch.
   Scribe V-shaped lines on the bar and rough_out with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power_tool.
   We used the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about.
020  thick and 1  dia. fitted on a 1 8  dia. mandrel.
   Such disks are very handy for cutting and shaping small parts.
   File to a smooth finish.
   A Barrette Swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without marring an adjoining one.
   Endeavor to get the notches as much alike as possible.
   The notch should have a smooth finish so_that the steel dog will slide easily over it.
   Assemble the parts in the frame and test the sliding action of the mating pieces.
   All matching surfaces should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis.
     Chuck a 2  or 3  piece of 1 8  dia. drill rod in a drill press or electric hand_tool.
   Fashion a sharp scribing point about 3 64  long on one end , using Swiss pattern files.
   This tool can also be made with a lathe.
    
    Scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics.
   Without math the men who are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go ' round would not have any means of analyzing , standardizing , and communicating the things they discover and learn.
   Math and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are , therefore , essential to any scientific endeavor.
     Hot rodding is a science.
   It 's not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit but it is , nevertheless , a science.
   But because science is based on mathematics does n't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician.
   A guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years without becoming even remotely involved_with mathematical problems ; however , he will have a clearer understanding of_what he is doing and the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few formulas that apply to rodding.
     A mathematical formula is nothing more_than a pattern for solving a specific problem.
   It places the various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in_relation_to each other so_that the influence of factors on each other can be computed.
     The first_step in using a formula is to insert the numerical_values of the factors involved in their correct positions in the formula.
   This changes the formula to an  equation .
   The equation is used for the mathematical_process of solving the problem.
     Equations for rodding formulas are not complicated.
   They involve only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar_school arithmetic classes.
   However , it is essential that the various mathematical_symbols used in the equations be_understood so_that the mathematical_processes can be done properly and in their correct order.
   They indicate simple division , multiplication , subtraction , and addition.
     The symbol for division is a straight_line that separates two numbers placed one above the other.
   The lower number is always divided into the upper number :     * * f The symbol for multiplication is  .
   It is used to separate two or more numbers in a row.
   For_example :   * * f_Numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any order.
   The result will be the same regardless_of the order used.
     The symbol for subtraction is the standard minus_sign.
   This is nothing more_than a dash.
   It separates two or more numbers.
   The number on_the_right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on_the_left of the symbol.
   For_example : * * f When more_than two figures are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried_out from the left to right if the result is to be correct.
   For_example , for the problem * * f , 10 from 25 equals 15 , then 6 from 15 equals 9.
     Addition is indicated by the + symbol.
   The symbol is used to separate two or more numbers.
   For_example :   * * f_Numbers separated by addition symbols may be placed in any order.
     When solving an equation that involves division as_well as other steps , do all the division steps first to reduce those parts of the equation to their numerical_value.
   Multiplication , subtraction , and addition can then be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left end of the equation and working toward_the_right.
   Completing the division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication , subtraction , or addition steps : * * f This would be reduced by multiplying 8 times 6 and_then dividing the product by 12.
   This part of the equation would then become 4.
     For use in formulas , fractions should be converted to their decimal equivalents.
   The easiest way to do this is with a conversion chart.
   Charts for this purpose are available from many sources.
   They are included in all types of mathematical handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision measuring_instruments.
     The various mathematical_processes can be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places.
   Shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental effect on the accuracy of the final result.
     Some formulas contain  constants .
   A constant is a number that remains the same regardless_of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant equation.
   It is a number without which the equation cannot be solved correctly.
     Rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport.
   The answers they give can often pave_the_way to performance increases and , quite often , are necessary for completing entry blanks for different events.
   When it is needed , one formula is as important as another.
   However , some formulas are used more_than others.
   We 'll take them in the general order of their popularity.
     A rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine.
   Displacement is sometimes referred to as  swept volume .
   Most entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information because of class restrictions.
   It is good to be able to compute displacement so_that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking can be computed.
     Factors involved in the displacement formula are the bore diameter of the engine 's cylinders , the length of the piston stroke , the number of cylinders in the engine , and a constant.
   The constant is.
7854 , which is one-quarter of 3.1416 , another constant known_as  pi .
   Pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions of circles.
     Actually , the engine displacement formula is the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the engine.
   The cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determined and_then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying the area by the stroke length , which is the equivalent of the length of the cylinders.
   Multiplying the result by the number of cylinders in the engine gives the engine 's total displacement.
     The formula is : * * f.
   Dimensions in inches , and fractions of inches will give the displacement in cubic_inches.
   Dimensions in centimeters and fractions of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic_centimeters ( cc ).
   One inch equals 2.54 centimeters : one cubic_inch equals 16.38 cubic_centimeters.
     For_example , let 's consider a standard 283 cubic_inch Chevy_V8.
   These engines have a cylinder diameter of 3 - 7 8 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches.
   The formula , with the fractions converted to decimals , becomes * * f.
     To arrive_at the answer , multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of the group and working to the right.
   The different steps will look_like this * * f.
     A cylinder 's compression ratio is computed by comparing the cylinder 's volume , or its displacement , with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber.
   Cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber volume must be measured with a liquid.
     Cylinder volume is determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula : * * f.
     To measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers in the cylinder_head , install the valves and spark_plug in the chamber and support the head so_that its gasket surface is level.
   Then pour water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill the chamber to its gasket surface.
   Do not overfill the chamber.
   This is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface_tension.
   Such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface around the chamber before they will flow_out of the chamber.
     The amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from the original quantity.
   Most beakers are graduated in cubic_centimeters ( cc ) , making it necessary to convert the result to cubic_inches.
   However , the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic_centimeters.
   The compression ratio arrived_at with the formula will be the same regardless_of whether cubic_inches or cubic_centimeters are used.
   The only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be quoted in the same terms.
     The volume of the cylinder opening in_the_head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square_inches by the gasket 's thickness in thousandths of an inch.
   Sometimes it is necessary to roughly calculate the square_inch area of the opening but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy that it won n't affect the final computation.
   The volume of the opening is_added to the combustion chamber volume.
     Another thing that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder_block when the piston is in top dead center position.
   Compute this volume by measuring the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring device and_then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth.
   The formula for this step is : * * f This volume is_added to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head_gasket opening.
   The total of these three volumes is the  final combustion chamber volume .
     After the factors just described have been computed , they are applied_to the following formula : * * f For an example let 's dream_up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic_inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic_inches.
   Applying these figures to the formula we get the equation : * * f The compression ratio is 10 to 1.
     This method of computing compression ratio cannot be used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly shaped heads.
   Any irregularity on the piston heads will make it impossible , with normal means , to determine the final combustion chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot be readily computed.
   The only way to determine the final combustion chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid while the cylinder_head is bolted to the cylinder_block and the piston is in top dead center position.
     There are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships of car speed , engine speed , rear axle gear ratio , and rear tire size.
   By using the appropriate version any one of these factors can be determined for any combination of the other three.
     To simplify the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of the factors.
     These are MPH for Car speed RPM for Engine crankshaft speed R for Rear axle gear ratio W for Tire size Tire size can be determined in several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly.
   This is done by measuring the distance from the surface on_which the tire is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft.
   A tire must be inflated to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to its operating weight when this measurement is made.
   The measurement must be in inches.
   Any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement must be converted to a decimal equivalent_to simplify the mathematics.
   When tire size is measured in_this manner a constant of 168 is used in the formula.
     To determine car speed for a given combination of engine speed , gear ratio , and tire size , the formula is : * * f For an engine speed of 5000 rpm , a gear ratio of 4.00 to 1 , and a tire radius of 13 inches , the equation would look_like this : * * f To determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three factors the formula is : * * f Using the same figures as for the previous example , the equation becomes : * *    
    - The best 2 - year-old pacing mile up_to_date at Ben_White_Raceway has been that of Mary_Liner ( Mainliner-Highland_Ellen ) , a member of the Dick_Williams stable , who was clocked 2 : 25.
   She is owned by Ralph_H._Kroening , Milwaukee , Wis. , who , according to the railbirds , can feel justly proud_of her.
     Other good miles have been by Debonnie ( Dale_Frost-Debby_Hanover ) and Prompt_Time ( Adios-On_Time ) in 2 : 28 - : 36 ; Kimberly_Gal ( Galophone-Kimberly_Hanover ) 2 : 26.2 ; Laguerre_Hanover ( Tar_Heel - Lotus_Hanover ) and Monel ( Tar_Heel-Miracle_Byrd ) in 2 : 34 h.
   Laguerre_Hanover is outstanding in type and conformation - good body , plenty of heart girth , stands straight on his legs on excellent feet - and has the smoothest gait.
   This colt is behind most_of the other 2 - year-olds in the Simpson stable but can show about as much pace as any of them.
   Monel shows improvement with each work-out and looks the makings of a good brood mare after winning her share of races.
     Stardel ( Star 's Pride-Starlette_Hanover ) , 2 : 34 h , looks quite promising.
   Fury_Hanover ( Hoot_Mon-Fay ) , Caper ( Hoot_Mon-Columbia_Hanover ) and Isaac ( Hoot_Mon-Goddess_Hanover ) have been working together but have not equalled their best work done some weeks ago.
   Fury and Caper worked in 2 : 35 h and did it with ease.
   They are two good colts of different type.
   Fury is upstanding and on the rangy side , and Caper is more the compact type.
   I have never seen Caper off his feet - he seems to know nothing but ' trot ' and keeps trying a_little harder if asked to do so.
   Fury has made a_few mistakes but looks like a wonderful prospect , with his impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground.
     Trackdown ( Torrid-Mighty_Lady ) has worked a mile in 2 : 33.3 h.
   It took this colt several weeks to strike a pace.
   Then , after emasculation , he was eased_up for a_couple_of weeks.
   He has thrived on all he has gone_through and looks the makings of a good little race_horse.
     Thor_Hanover ( Adios-Trustful_Hanover ) is a wonderful looking prospect and another good individual , with solid , rugged conformation , good , flat_bone and excellent feet.
   This colt arrived_at the Raceway early last November , and immediately was put into harness and line-driven for a_few days , and_then put to cart and broken_in very nicely , knowing nothing but trot.
   He appeared in the hopples about November 14 , was treated for worms on the 18 th , the latter date being the first time he struck a real pace.
   On December 5 he paced a mile in 2 : 55 on the twice-around , out in third position all_the_way.
   This colt has done everything asked of him , and done it with ease.
   His best mile to_date is 2 : 32.2 h.
     Gamecock ( Tar_Heel-Terka_Hanover ) is another promising colt , and his best time is 2 : 32.2 h.
   This is one of the best-tempered Tar Heels ever at the center.
   The first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle old mare ; the crupper under his tail seemed to be old stuff.
   The fourth time in harness he walked off like a gentleman.
   Being blistered for curbs has delayed his work somewhat.
   But up_to_date he has shown as much_as any in the big Simpson stable.
     Hustler ( Knight_Dream-Torkin ) is a playful bay rascal of a colt , not the best gaited , but he surely can pace and is right_there with them , and sometimes leading them , in the best miles.
   Torrid_Freight ( Torrid-Breeze On Hal ) is a very rugged , strong-made colt with a wonderful stride who has done with ease everything asked of him.
   His best time is around 2 : 33.
     Strongheart ( Adios-Direct_Gal ) , a fair-looking sorrel colt , knows nothing but pace and has been right_there in the best miles.
   Torrid_Adios ( Torrid-Adios_Molly ) is not so masculine as most_of the colts , but I like his type and he certainly is one of the best-gaited pacers on the grounds.
   Blistered for curbs and laid_off three weeks , he is coming_along fine and looks_like a pacer to me.
   First_Flyer ( Frisco_Flyer-Castle_Light ) looks_like a splendid candidate for the Illinois_Stakes.
   His best time is 2 : 33.2 h.
     The colts in Simpson 's stable have little if anything on the fillies , especially the pacers.
   Justine_Hanover ( Sampson_Hanover-Justitia_Hanover ) is improving with each work-out and paced 2 : 32.4 h weeks ago.
     Mrs._Freight ( Knight_Dream-Miss_Reed ) shows promise and does it in good form , and her best time is about 2 : 35.
   Hoopla ( Tar_Heel-Holiday_Hanover ) , a filly that wanted to trot , knocked herself October 31 and November_1 fighting the hopples.
   She was then trained on the trot until December 29 , hitched to a breaking cart once around the half-mile track and hoppled again.
   This time she submitted and in a_few days was going good.
   On January 11 she paced a mile in 2 : 43.1 - : 38 h ; on Jan. 18 2 : 37.3 - : 36.1 h ; on Jan. 21 , 2 : 36.
   This filly is a much better individual than either of her full-sisters , Valentine_Day and Cerise - more scale and much better underpinning.
   She is more like her full brother , Taraday_Hanover , but larger.
   Up_to_date she is a grand-looking filly.
     Pete_Dailey has four promising 2 - year-old pacers.
   Marquis Pick ( Gene_Abbe-Direct_Grattan ) seems to be the pick of the stable at_the_present_time.
   He is a fine-looking colt with a good body , good set of legs and nice way of going.
   His best mile to_date is 2 : 28 - : 33.
   Majestic Pick comes next , with a mile in 2 : 30 - : 33.2.
   This colt is another fine-looking equine.
   Staley_Hanover ( Knight_Dream-Sweetmite_Hanover ) is a_little on the small side but a very compact colt and looks_like one to stand training and many future battles with colts in his class.
   Best time to_date is 2 : 34 - : 34.
   Step Aside ( Direct Rhythm-Wily Widow ) has worked in 2 : 32 on the half-mile track and shows promise.
     Most_of Billy_Haughton 's 2 - year-olds have worked from 2 : 40 to 2 : 35.
   Bonnie_Wick ( Gene_Abbe-Scotch_Mary ) has gone in 2 : 36 h ; Hickory_Ash ( Titan_Hanover-Misty_Hanover ) in 2 : 35.
   The first time I saw the latter filly she trotted by me and I noticed such a family resemblance that I said to myself ,  that must be Hickory_Ash .
   She is a beautiful filly and likes to trot.
   Hickory_Hill ( Star 's Pride-Venus_Hanover ) has gone in 2 : 33 h ; Hickory_Spark ( Harlan-Hickory_Tiny ) 2 : 37 h ; Buxton_Hanover ( Tar_Heel-Beryl_Hanover ) 2 : 35 ; Faber 's Kathy ( Faber_Hanover-Ceyway ) 2 : 37 h ; Honor_Rodney ( Rodney-Honor_Bright ) around 2 : 40.
   The last-named is a fine-looking , large colt , who has been unfortunate to be laid_off for_some_time due_to injuries.
   He is going sound again now , and looks good.
     Brief_Candle ( Harlan-Marcia ) has gone in 2 : 37 h ; Lena_Faber ( Faber_Hanover-Chalidale_Lena ) 2 : 33 h ; Martha_Rodney ( Rodney-Miss_Martha D.
 ) 2 : 35 h ; Checkit ( Faber_Hanover-Supermarket ) 2 : 35 h ; Charm_Rodney ( Rodney-The_Charmer ) 2 : 37 h ; Fair_Sail ( Farvel-Topsy_Herring ) 2 : 36 h ; Custom_Maid ( Knight_Dream-Way_Dream ) 2 : 34.2 h ; Jacky_Dares ( Meadow_Gene-Princess_Lorraine ) 2 : 36 h ; Good Flying ( Good Time-Olivette_Hanover ) 2 : 36 h ; Bordner_Hanover ( Tar_Heel-Betty_Mahone ) 2 : 34 ; Faber 's Choice ( Faber_Hanover-Sally_Joe_Whippet ) 2 : 36 h ; Invercalt ( Florican-Inverness ) 2 : 35 h ; Duffy_Dares ( Meadow_Gene-Princess_Mite ) 2 : 36 h ; Harold_J. ( Worthy_Boy-Lady_Scotland ) 2 : 36 ; Knightfall ( Knight_Dream-Miss_Worthy_Grapes ) 2 : 36 h ; Next Knight ( Knight_Dream-Next_Time ) 2 : 36 h ; Trader_Jet ( Florican-My_Precious ) 2 : 37 h ; Trader_Rich ( Worthy_Boy-Marquita_Hanover ) 2 : 37 h ; Good Little_Girl ( Good Time-Mynah_Hanover ) 2 : 36 h ; Iosola_Hanover ( Kimberly_Kid-Isoletta_Hanover ) 2 : 36 h.
   The last-named is one of the favorites in the stable , and the boys like her very_much.
   I will be able to tell you more about this string of equines in the near future.
     I have just seen Debonnie and Prompt_Time work a mile in 2 : 34 , last_quarter in : 35.3.
   In going_away Debonnie got_behind several lengths , stalling at_the_start - she is a_little fussy.
   They left the three-quarters together and finished almost together.
   Prompt_Time shows class.
   This filly is another Adios that wants to trot , and trot she did until forced to do otherwise.
   After well broken and equipped with 12 oz shoes on behind , bare-footed in_front , she would trot a real storm with the master , Delvin , driving.
   Being placed in the hopples she was completely baffled.
   She hesitated , she hopped , she roll and rocked , skipped and jumped , but in some two_weeks she started to pace , From_that time to this she has shown steady improvement and now looks_like one of the classiest things on the grounds.
     Rain on Friday prevented many workouts , but there were a_few miles of note on Thursday.
   Those responsible included Stardel_Hanover ( Star 's Pride-Starlette_Hanover ) , 2 : 30 - : 34.3 ; Lorena_Gallon ( Bill_Gallon-Loren_Hanover ) , 2 : 30 - : 34.3 ; Prudent_Hanover ( Dean_Hanover-Precious_Hanover ) , 2 : 30.3 - : 35.3 ; Premium_Freight ( Titan_Hanover-Pebble_Hanover ) , 2 : 30.3 - : 35.3 ; Laguerre_Hanover ( Tar_Heel-Lotus_Hanover ) , 2 : 30.3 - : 36.1 ; Monel ( Tar_Heel-Miracle_Byrd ) , 2 : 30.3 - : 36.1 ; Fury_Hanover ( Hoot_Mon-Fay ) , 2 : 30.3 - : 36 ; Isaac ( Hoot_Mon-Goddess_Hanover ) , 2 : 30.3 - : 36 ; Caper ( Hoot_Mon-Columbia_Hanover ) , 2 : 30.3 - : 36 ; Lucky_Freight ( Knight_Dream-Lusty_Helen ) , 2 : 31.3 - : 35.3.
     Sam_Caton 's Butterwyn ( Scotch_Victor-Butler_Wyn ) , a light bay filly , knows nothing but trot and has worked_on the half-mile in 2 : 30 - : 36.
   Riverboat ( Dalzell-Cousin_Rachel ) has gone in 2 : 38 h.
   Sam is having his troubles with Layton_Hanover ( Dean_Hanover-Lucy_Hanover ) , but hope to have him straightened_out and going before_long.
     Jimmy_Jordon is high on Adios_Scarlet ( Adios-Rena_Grattan ) and she sure looks good as she goes_by.
   Her best time to_date is about 2 : 30 h.
   He also likes Hampton_Hanover ( Titan_Hanover-Bertie_Hanover ) 2 : 37 h.
   Cathy_J._Hanover ( Tar_Heel-Kaola_Hanover ) , formerly called Karet_Hanover , has been rather a problem child , but it getting better all_the_while and can pace a twice around in about 2 : 31.
   Armbro_Comet ( Nibble_Hanover-Mauri_Hanover ) has been in 2 : 38.
     Flick Nipe 's and Neil_Engle 's Miss Phone ( Galophone-Prissy_Miss ) is a fine-looking filly with good disposition and good gait , and she has worked up to_date in 2 : 46.
     - After 52 rainless days , moisture finally came to Del_Mar , resulting in but one workout during the week for most_of the horses , and leaving us with less_than half our total average rainfall during the season.
     While 2 - year-olds are still gaining most_of the attention at the track , green horses are starting to go a_bit , and Jimmy_Cruise has several that can really make_it.
   Work-outs for the week are as_follows : Plain_Scotch , 3 ( by Scotch_Victor ) , Demon_Law , 3 ( by Demon_Hanover ) , Coffee_Royal , p ( by Royal_Blackstone ) and Beauty Way , p , 3 ( by Demon_Hanover ) in 2 : 25 ; Eddie_Duke , p , 3 ( by Duke of Lullwater ) , Marilyn_C. , p ( by Sampson_Hanover ) and Chalidale_Barry , 5 ( by King 's Ransom ) in 2 : 20 ; Tiger_Hanover , p , 3 ( by Adios ) in 2 : 26 ; Sherwood_Lass , 4 ( by Victory_Song ) in 2 : 22 ; and Dauntless , 3 ( by Greentree_Adios ) in 2 : 32.

    The average reader of_this magazine owns more_than one gun ( we ran a survey to find_out ) but he 's always on the lookout for new and better arms.
   He 's more_than a reader of outdoor articles ; he 's a real hunter and shooter , eager to improve his sport.
   Well , if you 're that kind_of sportsman we 're here to help you.
   You 've probably given a_lot_of Christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack , but it 's not easy to decide on a new one.
   You still have time to drop a_few hints about the gifts you 'd appreciate most ; the time to decide on them is now.
   As a Christmas service , I 've taken a close look at this year 's crop of new models.
   Here they are , with my comments and judgments.
   Read on , take your pick - and start dropping those hints.
     First on my own list would be two arms - a rifle and a handgun - that qualify as new in the strictest sense.
   For me , a changed barrel length or an improved stock does n't constitute a truly new design.
   Such modifications are all for the best but it takes something as different as a Deerstalker or a Jet to change arms-making concepts.
     Bill_Ruger 's long-awaited Deerstalker ( under $ 110 ) is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the modern theory of high-velocity fans ; it 's a short , light , quick-handling , fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug at modest velocity but with lots_of killing power and ample range for our most popular big_game - whitetail.
     Ruger reports that on his recent African safari the little.
44 Magnum cartridge was a real work horse.
   Small antelope were generally grassed with one_shot , and the.
44 Magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck , kob and wart hog with deadly efficiency ; these are fairly large , tough animals.
     The deadliness of the.
44 Magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to me.
   At_least five years ago , Tom_Robinson of Marlin made_up an over / under double rifle for me in_this caliber , using the now defunct Model 90 action in 20 - gauge size.
   After figuring_out how to regulate the barrels so_that they shot to the same point of impact , we fired this little 20 - inch-barrel job on my home_range and in Marlin 's underground test gallery.
   We quickly ran_into the same trouble that plagued Bill_Ruger in his first experiments : Three or four bullets would be placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and_then , unaccountably , one could stray far out of the group.
     Ruger learned that this was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet.
   The new , jacketed slug in.
44 Magnum corrected this.
   But even without jacketed bullets , I had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt that first year.
   Within half an hour I jumped a six-point buck that hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket , and I caught him just behind the left foreleg at 60 yards.
   He moved only about 30 feet after the 240 - grain slug hit him - and this was after the bullet had passed_through a sapling.
     Three more deer have fallen to this same gun , and all were one-shot kills.
   My double was made with standard-weight revolver barrels ( before cutting to revolver length ) , and although it compares well in_other_respects , it 's considerably heavier than the Deerstalker , which only scales about 6 - 1 2 pounds.
     If ever a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter , this is it.
   The Deerstalker points with the ease , speed and precision of a fine imported double shotgun , and its trigger pull is light and sharp.
   The 240 - grain bullet leaves the muzzle at 1850 fps , which gives it all the smash needed at woods ranges.
   With five shots at the immediate command of the hunter 's trigger finger , the gun and load are a deadly combination.
     The second really new development this year was a revolver handling a different sort_of varmint load - the.
22 Remington_Jet Magnum Center_Fire.
   At_present it 's available in one model , the fine and familiar Smith + Wesson Magnum revolver ( about $ 110 ) , long a top-quality handgun among target arms.
   The velocity of_this.
22 - caliber , 40 - grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2460 fps , and it 's the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge , with a mid-range rise of about an inch over a 100 - yard range.
   This is a varmint load , pure_and_simple ; it 's much too explosive for small edible game.
   It can cut a red_squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry of feathers.
     The_most intriguing aspect of the S + W Magnum chambered for the new Jet is that it can also fire standard.
22 rim-fires by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers.
   You may therefore convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm , although the difference in the point of impact ( Jet vs. rim-fire ) can be somewhat disconcerting.
   The accuracy of the Jet cartridge is fine ; I tested it in my scoped S + W and it was good enough to allow me to hit a chuck with every shot at 100 yards if I did my part by holding the handgun steadily.
     The fact that the Deerstalker and the Jet were the only completely new designs this year does n't mean that 1961 did n't see changes in models , actions and calibers.
   Aside from the Ruger carbine , a_number_of hunting rifles have been introduced for_the_first_time.
   Here are the brands ( in_alphabetical_order ) and the new models.
     Newcomers to the American hunter are the Browning group of bolt-action , high-power rifles.
   They have fine FN actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal and the stock wood.
   Barrel weights vary sensibly with the various calibers available , and these include the standard bores ( about $ 165 ) plus the Magnums ( around $ 170 ) ; the latter include the.
264 ,.
300 H + H ,.
338 ,.
375 and.
458.
   Shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard on all_of the Magnums except the.
264.
   Stock designs are excellent for use with scopes.
     Colt 's center-fire 1961 rifles are all made with Sako actions , regardless_of caliber.
   The.
222 's have the short action ; the.
243 and.
308 , the medium action , and the.
270 , * * f and the Magnums , the long action ( about $ 135 for the Standard Coltsman and $ 200 for the Custom version ).
   Previously , FN actions were used for the larger cartridges.
     High standard has introduced a.
22 auto , the Sport-King , in two grades - field and special ( less_than $ 45 and just over $ 45 , respectively ).
   It 's a streamlined rifle , fast and well-made.
     Among.
22 Magnum Rim-Fire rifles , 1961 's lone newcomer was the Kodiak Model 260 autoloader ( around $ 60 ).
   Previously known as Jefferson_Arms , Kodiak has given this 11 - shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design , and the 260 is the first autoloader to handle.
22 Magnum rim-fires.
     Marlin has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings.
   The Model 99 ( under $ 45 ) is a light-weight , streamlined.
22 rim-fire auto with a tubular magazine that holds 18 Long Rifles.
   It 's extremely accurate for an auto , and the test rifle I tried was completely trouble-free in functioning.
   The 989 ( about $ 40 ) is an even newer.
22 auto , this one with a seven - or 12 - shot clip.
     Once_again the Mossberg Targo outfit has appeared , but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun combination.
   The bore is unrifled but is provided with an insert tube which is rifled and which , surprisingly , gives pretty fair accuracy even_though it 's only 3 - 1 2 inches long.
   You can unscrew this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with.
22 shotshells - to break the little Targo clay targets.
   A trap for throwing these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so_that the shooter can throw his own targets.
   A spring trap for solid mounting and a regular hand trap are also available.
   You can have your choice of a seven-shot repeater , the 340 TR ( about $ 40 ) or a single-shot , the 320 TR ( $ 10 less ).
     The Targo is a good outfit for fun shooting or for economic wing-shooting practice , but it 's tougher than it looks to run_up a score on the clay birds.
   They 'll travel 50 feet or more when thrown from the spring trap but it 's almost impossible to break one after it passes the 35 - foot mark.
   The combination of thin pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get_on the_birds , right_now!
     Big Magnum calibers appeared in the Remington line for 1961 , with the addition of the.
375 and.
458 to the list of Model 725 's.
   These are made on special order only , in Kodiak grade ( about $ 310 ) , with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads ; they weigh around nine pounds.
     A shortened version of the highly regarded Remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961.
   This carbine ( under $ 140 , about $ 15 more for a deluxe grade ) has an 18 - 1 2 - inch barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year 's Model 760 pump with a short-barrel.
   This design is hard to beat for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard.
   Presently , the 742 C is available in * * f.
     The latest versions of the famous Savage Model 99 are the 99 Featherweight ( about $ 125 ) and the 99 Deluxe ( under $ 135 ) , which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger design.
   The replacement of the slide-lock side safety_catch will make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new safety is easier and faster to operate.
     A fresh crop of beginners ' guns showed_up in 1961 , and they 're good bets for your Christmas_gift list if you 're wondering what to get for a youngster.
   The_most unusual of them is the Ithaca 49 ( about $ 20 , $ 5 for a saddle scabbard ) - a lever-action single-shot patterned after the famous Winchester lever-action and featuring the Western look.
   Because of its traditional lines , it probably has more kid appeal than any other model.
   The action is a drop-block , handling all the standard.
22 rim-fires.
     Marlin 's latest is also designed for the beginning shooter , although it 's a full-sized rifle with plenty of barrel weight and ample stock.
   This is the Model 122 ( about $ 20 ) ; it 's a single-shot bolt-action with an automatic safety - i. e. , the safety goes_on every time the bolt is_lifted and the gun cocked for the next shot.
   Stock design is excellent , and this model is a good first gun.
   Another boy 's model is the.
22 single-shot Remington 514 C ( around $ 20 ) , which comes_with a 21 - inch barrel and a short - 12 - 1 2 - inch - stock ; it 's just_right for a boy of 12 - 1 2.
     A beginner 's shotgun has also been introduced this year.
   The single-barrel Stevens 940 Y ( under $ 35 ) is made with a side lever rather_than a top-tang lever because many youngsters are n't strong enough to operate a top tang to open a gun - and the side lever does indeed open very easily.
   This gun has a 12 - 1 2 - inch stock and is available in either 20 or.
410 gauge.
   There 's another addition to the Stevens line , the pump-action Model 77 in.
410 ( under $ 75 ) , which you may or may_not consider a kid 's gun ; many experienced hunters like this gauge and type of scattergun too.
     Although there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year , a_number_of new models and variations of existing models did hit the market.
   For_example , a Browning trap version of the Superposed over / under , the Broadway ( from $ 350 up , depending_on grade ) , differs from standard models in_that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore end , a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast sighting.
     The Colt line now includes a new scattergun , the Standard or Custom_Pump Model ( about $ 90 and $ 150 , respectively ) in 12 , 16 and 20.
     Firearms_International has introduced another import , this one from Finland.
   It 's the Valmet ( about $ 170 ) , a 12 - gauge over / under very_much_like the old Remington 32 - which was so fine a gun that today a used one still brings high prices.
     High_Standard has also added two models to its line.
   The Supermatic Trophy ( prices begin at less_than $ 135 and depend_on grade and optional features ) is a 12 - gauge auto.
   The Flite-King Trophy ( beginning at just over $ 85 ) is a pump gun in 12 or 16.
   Either model is a very good dollar value.
     Mossberg 's latest contribution to the field is the Model 500 ( from $ 73.50 ) ; this is an improved version of the old Model 200 , a pump-action 12 - gauge shotgun.
   See page 24 for a complete report on it.
     Aside from the.
22 Jet - which I coupled with the Deerstalker carbine as one of the year 's two biggest developments - few significant innovations appeared among 1961 's handguns.
    
    Livery_Stable - J._Vernon , Prop. Coaching had declined considerably by 1905 , but the sign was still there , near the old Wells_Fargo building in San_Francisco , creaking in the fog as it had for thirty years.
   John_Vernon had had all the patronage he cared_for - he had prospered , but he could not retire from horsedom.
   Coaching was in his blood.
   He had two interests in life : the pleasures of the table and driving.
   Twice a week he drove his tallyho over the Santa_Cruz road , upland and through the redwood forest , with orchards below him at one hand , and glimpses of the Pacific at the other.
   The journey back he made along the coast road , traveling hell-for-leather , every lantern of the tallyho ablaze.
     The southward route was the classic run in California , and the_most fashionable.
   His patronage on this stretch was made_up largely of San_Franciscans - regulars , most_of them , and trenchermen like himself.
   They did not complain at the inhuman hour of starting ( seven in the morning ) , nor of the tariff , which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco.
   Breakfast was at the Palace_Hotel , luncheon was somewhere in the mountain forest , and dinner was either at Boulder_Creek or at Santa_Cruz.
     Gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring , so halts were contrived between meals.
   Then the Chinese hostler , who rode with Vernon on the box , would break_open a hamper and produce filets of smoked bass or sturgeon , sandwiches , pickled eggs , and a rum sangaree to be heated over a spirit_lamp.
     In spring and in autumn the run was made for a group of botanists which included an old friend of mine.
   They gathered roots , bulbs , odd ferns , leaves , and bits of resin from the rare Santa_Lucia_fir , which exists only on a forty-five mile strip on the westerly side of these mountains.
   In the Spanish days Franciscan monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense.
   It yields a fragrance as Orphic as that of the pastilles of Malabar.
   Vernon was serviceable on the botanical field trips , but he could arrange no schedule with the cooks , and he was glad when the trips dropped_off , and the botanists began to motor out by themselves.
     My friend often breakfasted with Vernon on the morning of the regular tallyho run.
   This was an honor , like dining with a captain at his private table.
   Vernon 's office adjoined the stable , and the walls were adorned with brightly colored lithographs , the folk_art of the period.
   They advertised harness polish , liniments , Ball 's Rubber_Boots , Green_River Whiskey , Hood 's Sarsaparilla , patent_medicines , shoe blacking , and chewing tobacco.
     The hostler would have the table ready and a pot of coffee hissing on the stove ; then a porter from Manning 's Fish_House would trot in with a tray on his head.
   It was draped with snowy napkins that kept hot a platter of oyster salt roast and a mound of corn_fritters.
   Vernon was consummately fond of oysters , and Manning 's had been famous for them since the Civil_War.
   Oyster salt roast - oysters on the half shell , cooked on a bed of coarse salt that kept them hot when served - was a standby at Manning 's.
   Its early morning patrons were coachmen , who fortified themselves for the day with_that delicacy.
     In the 1890 's the Palace_Hotel began serving an oyster dish named after its manager , John_C._Kirkpatrick.
   This dish much resembles the oysters_Rockefeller made famous by Antoine 's in New_Orleans , though the Palace chef announced it as a variant of Manning 's roast oysters.
   ( Gastronomes have long argued about which came first , the Palace 's or Antoine 's.
   Antoine 's held as mandatory a splash of absinthe or Pernod on the parsley or spinach which was used for the underbedding.
   The Kirkpatrick version holds liqueur as optional.
 )   Vernon , however , held_out for plain oyster roast , and plenty of_it , unadorned by herbs or any seasoning but salt , though he did fancy a_bit of lemon.
     After the meal , he and his guests went_out to inspect the rig ; this was merely a ritual , to please all hands concerned.
   The tallyho had cost Vernon $ 2300.
   A replica of two coaches made in England for the Belmont_Club in the East , and matchless west of the Rockies , it was the despair of whips on the Santa_Cruz run.
   One could shave in the reflection of its French-polished panels , and its axles were greased like those of roulette_wheels.
   The horses were groomed to a high gloss ; departing , they stepped solemnly with knees lifted to the jaw , for they had been trained to drag at important funerals.
     But for the start of the Santa_Cruz run , the whip fell.
   The clients boarded the tallyho at the Palace promptly at seven.
   They had been fed a hunting breakfast , so called because a kedgeree , the dish identified with fox_hunting , was on the bill.
   There are many ways of making a kedgeree , every one of_which is right.
   Here is an original kedgeree recipe from the Family_Club 's kitchen.
     Flake ( for three ) a cupful of cold boiled haddock , mix with a cupful of cooked rice , two minced hard-boiled_eggs , some buttery white_sauce done_with cream , cayenne , pepper , salt , a pinch of curry , a tablespoonful of minced onion fried , and a_bit of anchovy.
   Heat and serve hot on toast.
     The omelet named for Ernest_Arbogast , the Palace 's chef , was even more in_demand.
   For decades it was the_most popular dish served in the Ladies ' Grill at breakfast , and it is one of the few old Palace dishes that still survive.
   Native_California oysters , salty and piquant , as coppery as Delawares and not_much larger than a five-cent piece , went into it.
   The original formula goes thus.
     Fry in butter a small minced onion , rub with a tablespoonful of flour , add half a cup of cream , six beaten eggs , pepper , celery_salt , a teaspoonful of minced chives , a dash of cayenne , and a pinch of nutmeg.
   A jigger of dry Sherry follows , and as the mixture stiffens , in go a_hundred of the little oysters.
     Louis_Sherry once stayed a fortnight at the Palace , and he was so pleased with omelet Arbogast that he introduced it at his restaurant in New_York.
   J._Pierpont_Morgan had come_in his private train to San_Francisco , to attend an Episcopal convention , and brought the restaurateur with him.
   As things happened , Morgan was_installed in the Nob_Hill residence of a magnate friend , whose kitchen swarmed with cooks of approved talent.
   Sherry remained in his hotel suite , where he amused himself as best he could.
   Twice he left everything to his entourage , and fled to make the Santa_Cruz tour under Vernon 's guidance.
     In the grand court of the Palace , notable for its tiers of Moorish galleries that looked down on the maelstrom of vehicles below , Vernon 's station was at the entrance.
   It was a post of honor , held inviolate for him ; he had the primacy among the coachmen.
   Of majestic build , rubicund and slash-mouthed , he resembled the late General_Winfield_Scott , who was said to be the_most imposing general of his century , if_not of all centuries.
   Vernon wore a gray tall hat , a gardenia , and maroon Wellington_boots that glistened like currant jelly.
     Promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court with twelve in the tallyho.
   He had style : he held his reins in a loose bunch at the third button of his checked Epsom surtout , and when the horses leaned at a curve , as if bent by the force of a gale , he leaned with them.
   They cantered down the peninsula , not slackening until the coach reached Woodside where the Santa_Cruz uplands begin.
     The road maps of the region have changed since 1905 ; inns have burned_down , moved elsewhere , or taken other names.
   Once on_the_road ( and especially if the passengers were all regulars and masculine ) , the schedule meant nothing.
   An agreeable ease suffused Vernon and the passengers of the tallyho , from which there issued clouds of smoke.
   Vernon would tilt his hat over one ear as he lounged with his feet on the dashboard , indulging in a huge cigar.
   The horses moved at a clump ; they were no_more on parade than was their driver ; one fork of the road was as_good_as another.
   The Santa_Cruz mountains sprawl over three counties , and the roads twist through sky-tapping redwoods down whose furrowed columns ripple streams of rain , even when heat bakes the Santa_Clara valley below at the left.
   The water splashes into shoulder-high tracts of fernery.
   You arrive there in seersucker , and feel you were half-witted not to bring a mackintosh.
     Vernon kept an account_book with a list of all the establishments that he thought worthy of patronage.
   A_number_of them must have fallen_into disfavor ; they were struck_out with remarks in red ink , denouncing both the cooks and the management.
   He was copious in his praise of those that served food that was good to eat.
   The horses seemed to know these by instinct , he used_to say : such places invariably had stables with superior feed bins.
     There was Wright 's , for one , lost amongst trees , its wide verandas strewn with rockers.
   Many_of its sojourners were devoted_to seclusion and quiet , and lived there to the end of their days.
   It was the haunt of writer Ambrose_Bierce , who admired its redwoods.
   Acorns from the great oaks fed the small black pigs ( akin to Berkshires ) , whose  carcass sweepstakes  were renowned.
   Their ham butts , cured in oak-log smoke , were also esteemed when roasted or boiled , and served with this original sauce.
     Put into a saucepan a cupful of the baked ham gravy , or of the boiled ham liquor , with a half stick of butter , three teaspoonfuls of made mustard , and two mashed garlic_cloves.
   Contribute also an onion , a peeled tomato and two pickled gherkins , and a mashed lime.
   After this has simmered an hour , add two tablespoons each of Worcestershire , catsup , and chutney , two pickled walnuts , and a pint of Sherry.
   Then simmer fifteen minutes longer.
     Every winter a kegful of_this sauce was made and placed at the end of a row of four other kegs in the cellar , so_that when its turn came , it was properly mellowed.
     Vineyards and orchards also grew around Wright 's , and deer were rather a nuisance ; they leaped six-foot fences with the agility of panthers.
   But no one complained when they wound_up , regardless_of season , in venison pies.
   No one complained of the white_wine either : at this altitude of two thousand feet , grapes acquire a dryness and the tang of gunflint.
   ( The Almaden vineyards have now climbed to this height.
 )   Apple trees grew there also.
   Though creeks in the Santa_Cruz mountains flow brimful the year round and it is forever spring , the apples that grow there have a wintry crackle.
     Dwellers thereabouts preferred to get their apple_pies at the local bakery , which had a brick oven fired with redwood billets.
   The merit of the pie , Vernon believed , was_due more to its making than to the waning heat of the oven.
   The recipe , which he got from the baker , and wrote_down in his ledger , is basically this.
     Peel , core , and slice across enough apples to make a dome in the pie tin , and set_aside.
   In a saucepan put sufficient water to cover them , an equal amount of sugar , a sliced lemon , a tablespoonful of apricot preserve or jam , a pinch each of clove and nutmeg , and a large bay_leaf.
   Let this boil gently for twenty minutes , then strain.
   Poach the apples in_this syrup for twelve minutes , drain them , and cool.
     Set the apples in the pastry-lined tin , spread over them three tablespoonfuls of softened butter , with as much brown_sugar , a sprinkling of nutmeg , and a fresh bay_leaf , then lay on a cover of pastry , and gild it with beaten yolk of egg.
    
    Those who have never traveled the width and length of_this land cannot conceive , on the basis of textbook description alone , the overwhelming space and variety of_this country held together under one government.
   The miracle of democratic America comes_home to one most strongly only when one has seen the endless Great_Plains of the Midwest ; the sky-reaching peaks of the Northwest mountains ; the smoke-filled , art-filled , drama-filled life of the great cities of the East ; the lush and historic charm of the South.
   Now , to_add_to the already unbelievable extremes found in one nation , we have the two new states of Hawaii and Alaska.
     To hope to cover just one region of_this land and to enjoy all_of its sights and events and , of_course , to bring_back pictures of your experiences , requires advance planning.
   For this reason , U._S._Camera has prepared this special U._S._A. vacation feature.
   We divided the country into five regions plus Hawaii and Alaska and in each is included a general description of the area plus specific recommendations of places and events to cover.
   Any special photographic requirements are also given.
     Use this section to plan now to make the most of your vacation in photogenic America.
     Birthplace of the nation , the Northeast offers historic battlefields ; lovely old villages and a rugged seashore among its many worthwhile sights.
   The rolling farms of Maryland , the peerless metropolis of New_York_City , the verdant mountains of Vermont can all be included in your Northeast vacation.

   From here you can easily include a side trip to the old whaling port of Nantucket , Massachusetts , which looks just_as it must have two centuries ago.
     At Sturbridge_Village , Massachusetts , you 'll find a completely-restored New_England town.
   North to Acadia National_Park , Maine , with views of a rockbound coast and dark , magnificent forests.
     One of the_most exciting ways to end a Northeast vacation would be with a week in New_York_City.
   Return through New_England , stopping for a visit to Lake_Champlain where you can take a boat ride and go_to Ethan_Allen_Park.
   There you 'll witness a view which includes the Adirondack_Mts. and the Winooski_River.
     Now you 're ready for a whirlwind sightseeing tour of America 's most exciting city.
   The skyline , the bridges , Broadway , and the Staten_Island ferry are only a_few of the spots to put_on your  must  list for New_York_City.
     Some tips for shooting in Northeastern locales : In New_York_City do n't miss coverage of the United_Nations.
   These striking , modernistic buildings on the East_River are open_to the public and every weekday guided tours are available.
   Pictures can be taken in the public areas and when on_tours.
   However , the use of tripods is not allowed.
   Photos of Conference Rooms and the General_Assembly Hall can be made when these rooms are not being used for meetings.
   Flash is allowed , subject_to above restrictions.
     Around New_England , you 'll no_doubt want a color shot of one of the picturesque lighthouses.
   Be careful here not to overexpose this subject since they are extremely bright and light-reflecting.
   In color , 1 50 th of a second between * * f and * * f will do for bright , frontal sunlight.
     The Southern United_States , extending from Florida in the east to Texas in the west , still maintains its unique flavor of gracious living and historical elegance.
   It encompasses in its expanse areas where the natural beauty encourages a vacation of quiet contemplation , on_the_one_hand , to places where entertainment and spectacles of all sorts have been provided for the tourist with camera.
     Of special interest this anniversary year of the war_between_the_states are the many Civil_War battlefields where , likely as not , you 'll catch some memorial re-enactments.
   Among the locales to visit are Shiloh , Tennessee ; Lookout_Mountain , Tennessee ; Vicksburg , Mississippi ; Richmond , Virginia ; Petersburg , Virginia , and Fredericksburg , Virginia.
     Florida provides tropical scenes unequalled in the United_States.

     One of the_most delightful spots in a southern tour is the city of New_Orleans.
   The famous old_French and Spanish buildings with their elaborate wrought_iron balconies and the narrow streets of the Latin_Quarter present an Old_World scene.
     For restoration of early American life the places to visit are Williamsburg , Jamestown and Yorktown , Virginia.
   Another Virginia sight and a photographic adventure are the Luray_Caverns , lit by photofloodlights.
     The great state of Texas offers metropolitan attractions such_as the Dallas_Fair_Park with its art and natural_history museums.
   In contrast are the vast open stretches of ranch country and oil_wells.
   In San_Antonio visit the famous Alamo and photograph 18 th Century Spanish buildings and churches.
     The Great_Smoky Mountains is another area of the South well worth a visit.
   Along the 127 - mile route through Great_Smoky Mountains National_Park you can photograph the breath-taking peaks , gorges and valleys which come into view at every turn.
   Gatlinburg , Tennessee , is the center of_this area.
   Another scenic spot in Tennessee is Chattanooga where the Rock_City Gardens are not to be missed.
     Beautiful homes and gardens are trademarks of the South and cities particularly noted for them are Charleston , S._C. , Natchez , Miss. , and Savannah , Ga..
   At Charlottesville , Va. , shoot Monticello and the beautiful buildings of the University.
     Foliage is the outstanding photo subject in many_of the Southern locales mentioned above and some specific tips on how and where to shoot it are in_order.
   For_example , the Chamber_of_Commerce of Gatlinburg , Tennessee , sponsors special camera tours into the Great_Smoky Mountains to get pictures of the profusion of wild_flowers flourishing in these wooded regions.
     Exposure problems may occur in these forest areas where uneven lighting results from shafts of sunlight filtering through the overhead branches.
   Best solution is to find an area that is predominantly sunlight or shade.
   In any instance , you should determine the exposure according to the type of light which falls on most_of the subject_area.
     Try some closeups on Southern blossoms to provide a welcome contrast with the many long-view scenics you 'll be making.
     For shooting the interiors of the famous ante-bellum Southern mansions make sure your equipment includes a tripod.
   Enough daylight is usually available from the windows , but if you have synchronized flash - use it.
     For some unusual photographic subjects , if your vacation takes you nearby , try these events : the 600 - mile auto race in Charlotte , N._C. , on May 27 ; the Florida_Folk_Festival , White_Springs , May 5 - 7 ; Singing on the Mountain in Linville , North_Carolina , on June 25.

     A pleasant start to your midwestern vacation is a_few days spent in cosmopolitan Chicago.
   Lake_Michigan offers swimming and pictures which combine cityscapes with beaches.
   A visit to Chicago 's museums and a stroll around broad Michigan_Avenue will unfold many photogenic subjects to the alert photographer.
     Wisconsin_Dells , where fantastically scenic rocks carved by the Wisconsin_River are overgrown with fern and other foliage , rates a stopover when traveling from Chicago.
     The farmlands forming the heart of America stretch out across the Midwest from Chicago.

     In Missouri ( which we are including in our general Midwest region ) you can glance into Mark_Twain 's birthplace at Hannibal , see the landmarks of his life and writings and visualize where Huck_Finn hatched his boyish mischief.
     Similarly in Illinois there is Lincoln country to be seen - his tomb and other landmarks.
     Minnesota , fabled land of waters , is in itself , ideal vacationland , having within its borders 10000 lakes!
   Itasca_State_Park , where the Mississippi_River begins , is one of the outstanding tourist spots in Minnesota.

     Night scenes will add an exciting touch to your vacation travelogue and what better place to take them then along Chicago 's Lake_Shore_Drive?
   Just after sunset is a good time to record the city lights in color since you get a  fill-in  light from the sky.
     Another memo for sightseers : bring your camera along to museums.
   Photos of historic dioramas of the area you visit will add depth and background to your vacation photo story.
   Again , be sure your tripod is handy for those sometimes-necessary time_exposures.

     A Western vacation is practically synonymous with a visit to at_least one of the magnificent national_parks in_this area.
   A tour of several of them is possible in a two-week vacation while a stay at just one of these natural beauty_spots can be of equal reward.
     In California is located one of the_most popular of the national_parks - Yosemite.
   Among its most spectacular features are its falls , the highest being Upper_Yosemite which drops 2425 feet.
   The Sequoia_Grove presents another unique aspect of Yosemite , for these ancient giant trees are a sight never to be forgotten.
     In the Utah area are Zion National_Park and Bryce_Canyon National_Park.
   Fantastic colors are to be seen in the fanciful formations of eroded rock which loom out of the semiarid country in both parks.
     Colorado 's Grand_Canyon , probably the_most famous landmark of the United_States , can be the highpoint of your Western vacation.
    
    Built upon seven hills , Istanbul , like Rome , is one of the_most ancient cities in the world , filled with splendor and contrast.
   It is an exotic place , so different from the ordinary that the casual tourist is likely to see at_first only the contrast and the ugliness of narrow streets lined with haphazard houses.
   At the moment , many_of these are being pulled_down.
   Whole blocks are disappearing and more are scheduled to vanish to make room for wide boulevards that will show_off its treasures to better advantage - the great domes and graceful spires of its mosques , the panorama of the Bosphorus and the Golden_Horn.
   Even when they are finished , however , the contrast will remain , for Istanbul is the only city in the world that_is built upon two continents.
   For almost 3000 years Europe and Asia have rubbed shoulders in its streets.
     Founded in the Ninth_Century_B._C. it was_called Byzantium 200 years later when Byzas , ruler of the Megarians , expanded the settlement and named it after himself.
   About a_thousand years after_that , when the Roman_Empire was divided , it became capital of the Eastern section.
   On May 11 , 330 A._D. , its name was changed again , this time to Constantinople after its emperor , Constantine.
   In 1453 when the last vestige of ancient Roman power fell to the Turks , the city officially shifted religions - although the Patriarch , or Pope , of the Orthodox_Church continued to live there , and still does - and became the capital of the Ottoman_Empire.
   When that was broken_up after the First_World_War , its name was changed once_more.
   Rich_in Christian and Moslem art , Istanbul is today a fascinating museum of East and West that recently became a seaside resort as_well with the development of new beaches on the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara only a short distance from the center of town.
   Easy to get to , and becoming more popular every_year , it is only fourteen hours from New_York by Pan_American_World Airways jet , four hours from Rome.
     Most_of the sights lie_in the old section across the Golden_Horn from the modern hotels.
   I started my tour of them at the Turkish Government_Tourist_Office , next to Pan_American 's office on_the_left as you enter the driveway that leads to the Hilton_Hotel.
   From there I turned left along Cumhuriyet_Cadesi past more hotels and a park on_the_left , Republic Gardens , and came_in a_few moments to Taksim_Square , one of the hubs of the city , with the Monument of the Republic , erected in 1928 , in its center.
     Directly across from the Gardens I found a bus_stop sign for T 4 and rode it down to the Bosphorus , with the sports center on my left just before I reached the water and the entrance to Dolmabahce_Palace immediately after_that.
   There the bus turned right_along the Bosphorus , past ocean_liners at anchor , to Galata Bridge over the entrance to the Golden_Horn , a brown sweep of water that empties into the Bosphorus.
   Across the bridge on_the_left I saw St._Sophia with its sturdy brown minarets and to the right of them the slenderer spires of the_Blue Mosque.
     On the other side of the Golden_Horn I rode through Eminonu_Square , with Yeni_Cami , or the New_Mosque , which dates_from the Seventeenth Century , just across from the entrance to the bridge.
   Passing it , the bus climbed a hill , with the covered spice bazaar on_the_right and Pandelli 's , a famous and excellent restaurant , above it.
   At the top of the hill the buildings on_the_left gave_way to a park.
   I got_off there , crossed the street , walked ahead with St._Sophia on my left , the_Blue Mosque on my right , and in_a_moment came to the entrance of St._Sophia.
     Erected on the site of pagan temples and three previous St._Sophias , the first of_which was begun by Constantine , this fourth church was started by Justinian in 532 and completed twenty years later.
   On his first trip to the finished structure he boasted that he had built a temple grander than Solomon 's in Jerusalem.
   A_few years later the dome fell_in.
   Nevertheless , it remained one of the_most splendid churches of the Eastern_Empire , where the Byzantine Emperors were crowned.
   After the Turks conquered the city in 1453 they converted it to a mosque , adding the stubby minarets.
   In the second_half of the Sixteenth_Century , Sinan , the great architect who is the Michelangelo of the East , designed the massive buttresses that now help support the dome.
   With the birth of the Turkish Republic after the First_World_War , St._Sophia became a museum , and the ancient mosaics , which were plastered_over by the Moslems , whose religion forbids pictures in holy_places , have been_restored.
     Inside over the first door I saw one of these , which shows Constantine offering the city to the_Virgin Mary and Justinian offering the temple.
   On the columns around the immense dome are round plaques with Arabic writing.
   The eight green columns , I learned , came from the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus , the others , red , from the Temple of the Sun at Heliopolis.
     Beneath the dome I saw the spot where the Byzantine Emperors were crowned , a_bit of floor protected now by a wooden fence.
   Behind this is a minber or Moslem pulpit and near it a raised platform with golden grillwork , where the emperors and , after them , the sultans , sat.
   Directly opposite is the emperor 's door , through which they entered the building.
     Outside St._Sophia I walked through the flower_garden in_front of_it , with the_Blue Mosque ahead on my left.
   Across the street on my right I saw the Hippodrome , now a park.
   It was laid_out in 196 for chariot_races and other public games.
   Statues and other monuments that stood there were stolen , mostly by the waves of Crusaders.
     At the beginning of the Hippodrome I saw the Kaiser 's Fountain , an ugly octagonal building with a glass dome , built in 1895 by the German Emperor , and on my left , directly across from_it , the tomb of Sultan_Ahmet , who constructed the_Blue Mosque , more properly known by his name.
     Just before coming to the mosque entrance I crossed the street , entered the Hippodrome , and walked ahead to the Obelisk of Theodosius , originally erected in Heliopolis in Egypt about 1600 B._C. by Thutmose , who also built those now in New_York , London and Rome at the Lateran.
   This one was set_up here in 390 A._D. on a pedestal , the faces of_which are carved with statues of the emperor and his family watching games in the Hippodrome , done so realistically that the obelisk itself is_included_in them.
     Beyond it I noted a small green column , about twelve feet below the present ground_level - the Serpentine Column , three entwined serpents , which once stood at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi , Greece.
   Near the end of the Hippodrome I came_upon the Built Column , a truncated obelisk of blocks , all that remains of a monument that once rivalled the Colossus of Rhodes.
     Retracing my steps to the Mosque of Sultan_Ahmet , only one with six minarets , I entered the courtyard , with a gallery supported by pointed_arches running around it and a fountain in_the_middle.
   One of the_most beautiful buildings in Istanbul , it was_constructed in the early years of the Seventeenth Century , with a huge central dome , two half domes that seem to cascade_down from_it , and smaller full domes around the gallery.
   The round minarets , tall and graceful , rise from rectangular bases and have three platforms from which the muezzin can chant his call to prayer.
   Inside , the walls are covered with blue and white tile , the floor with red and cream carpets.
     Back at the Kaiser 's Fountain , I walked left to the streetcar stop and rode up the hill - any car will do - past the Column of Constantine , also_known_as the Burnt Column , at the top on my right.
   It stands in the middle of_what was once the Forum of Constantine , who brought it from Rome.
     I stayed on the car for a_few minutes until , turning right , it entered a huge square , Bayezit , with the Bayezit_Mosque on_the_right and the gate to the university just beyond it.
   There I got_off , crossed the square , and on_the_side directly opposite the gate found a good restaurant , hard to come_by in_this part of the city.
   Called the Marmara_Gazinosu , it is on the third floor , with signs pointing_the_way there , and has a terrace overlooking the Sea of Marmara.
   After lunch , in the arcade on my left just before reaching the street I found a pastry shop that sells some of the best baklava - a sweet , flaky cake - in Istanbul.
   It 's a great favorite of the university_students , and I joined them there for dessert.
     Taking the streetcar back to Kaiser 's Fountain , I walked ahead , then left down the street opposite St._Sophia and just beyond the corner came to a small , one-story building with a red-tile roof , which is the entrance to the Sunken_Palace.
   Actually an underground cistern , its roof supported by rows and rows of pillars , it was_built by Justinian in the Sixth_Century to supply the palace with water.
   There is still water in it.
   I found it fairly depressing and emerged almost immediately.
     Outside I walked past the entrance to St._Sophia , turned left at the end of_it , and continued toward a gate in the wall ahead.
   Just before reaching it I came to a grey and brown stone building that looks somewhat like an Oriental pagoda , with Arabic lettering in gold and colored tile decorations - the Fountain of Sultan_Ahmet.
     Going through the Imperial_Gate in the wall , I entered the grounds of Topkapi_Palace , home of the Sultans and nerve_center of the vast Ottoman_Empire , and walked along a road toward another gate in the distance , past the Church of St._Irene , completed by Constantine in 330 A._D. on my left , and_then , just outside the second gate , I saw a spring with a tap in the wall on my right - the Executioner 's Spring , where he washed his hands and his sword after beheading his victims.
     Passing_through the gate , with towers on either side once used as prisons , I entered a huge square surrounded by buildings , and on the wall to my right found a general plan of the grounds , with explanations in English for each building.
   There are a good many_of them.
   At_one_time about 10000 people lived there.
     Following arrowed signs , I veered right toward the former kitchens , complete with chimneys , which now house one of the world 's greatest collections of Chinese porcelain and a fabulous array of silver dinner_services.
   Next to_it is a copper section , with cooking_utensils and a figure of the chief cook in an elaborate , floor-length robe.
     In the court once_more , I went right toward the Reception House , a long one-story building with a deep portico.
   Going through a door into another small court , I had the Throne Room directly in_front.
   I walked to the right around it to buildings containing illuminated manuscripts and came to the Treasury , which houses such things as coffee_cups covered with diamonds , jewelled swords , rifles glittering with diamonds and huge divan-like thrones as large as small beds , on_which the sultans sat cross-legged.
   They are made of gold and covered with emeralds , pearls and other jewels.
     Taking the path behind the Throne Room to the building directly beyond it , the Portrait Gallery , I went right at the end of_it , through a garden to a small building at the back - a sitting_room furnished with low blue divans , its floor covered with carpets , its ceiling painted with gold squares and floral designs.
    
    Do start fires one or two hours ahead_of_time to obtain a lasting bed of glowing coals.
   Keep ashes from one barbecue to the next to sprinkle over coals if they are too hot , and to stop flames that arise from melting grease.
     Do line barbecue fire bowl with heavy foil to reflect heat.
     Do n't forget to buy a plastic pastry brush for basting with sauces.
   Clean it meticulously in boiling water and detergent , rinse thoroughly.
     Do build a wall of glowing coals six to eight inches in_front of meat that_is barbecued on an electric spit.
   Make use of the back of the barbecue or of the hood for heating vegetables , sauces and such.
     Do n't fail to shorten cooking time by the use of aluminum_foil cut slightly larger than the surface of steaks and chops.
   Sear on both sides then cover meat loosely with heat reflecting foil for juiciest results.
     Do avoid puncturing or cutting into meats to test them.
   If doubtful about a steak , boldly cut it in half.
   If necessary to replace both halves on grill , sear cuts and allot extra_time.
   For roasts , insert meat_thermometer diagonally so it does not rest_on bone.
   Also make sure thermometer does not touch the revolving spit or hit the coals.
     Do n't practice a new recipe on guests.
   Have a test-run on the family first , to be sure timing and seasoning are right.
     Do buy meat the day or the day before you intend to cook it.
   Keep it no_longer than 36 hours before cooking , and keep it in the coldest ( but non-freezing ) compartment of the refrigerator.
     Do n't plan meals that are too complicated.
   Limit yourself to good meat and drink , with bread , salad , corn or potatoes as accessories.
   Keep the desserts simple ; fruit does nicely.
     Do whatever kitchen work , such_as fixing a salad , preparing garlic_bread , or making a marinade sauce , ahead_of_time.
   When you start the outdoor performance , you can stay outdoors without a dozen running trips into the kitchen.
   ( This goes_for getting a drink tray ready , and for having a big cooler full_of ice on_hand long before the party begins.
 )     Do n't think you have_to start with the_most expensive equipment in the world.
   The simplest grill ( pan type ) or inexpensive hibachi can make you a chef.
   You need tongs to handle meat ; long forks for turning potatoes and corn ; heavy foil on_hand at_all_times.
   And lots_of hot_pads!
     Do keep the grill high enough above the fire so_that when fat from meat drips down and flares_up , flames cannot reach the meat.
     Do n't forget to have a supply of Melamine plates , bowls , cups , saucers , and platters for outdoor use.
   Made of the world 's toughest unbreakable plastic , Melamine dinnerware comes in almost 400 different patterns and dozens of colors.
   There is even one set that has  barbecue  written on it.
     Do without fancy tablecloths.
   It 's cheaper to buy Wall-Tex and cover your outdoor table.
   Or buy half_a_dozen lengths of oilcloth and change patterns for different kinds of barbecues.
   Oilcloth only costs about 79 c a yard for the very best.
   Tougher than plastic , it wears well.
     Do n't forget - when you take to the hills or the beach - that your cooler , which you might have used for wine - or beer-cooling on your terrace or back yard , is indispensable for carrying liquid refreshments.
   There are many varieties of coolers and they serve many purposes.
   With them , you can carry steaks and hamburgers at refrigerator temperatures , and also get your frozen_food for stews and chowders , to the marina or picnic , in A-1 condition.
     Do use paper napkins ; lots_of them.
   Except when you prepare  do_it_yourself  shish kebob or a lobster roast.
   Then you 'll want terry cloth towels for mopping_up.
     Do n't think barbecue cooking is just sometimes , or seasonal.
   It 's year-round , and everywhere.
   In the winter , hibachi in the kitchen or grill over the logs of the fireplace.
   Even use your portable electric or gas grill in the winter , inside.
   Summertime supper , outside , is a natural.
   You 'll find , once your technique is perfected , that you can cook on a boat with a simple Bernz-O-Matic.
     Do buy all-purpose mugs or cups.
   Get copper or earthenware mugs that keep beer chilled or soup hot.
   Be sure to get a_few_more than you need.
   You will discover you keep the sauce for basting meat in one , use six for drinks , serve soup or coffee in another half-dozen - and need one more to mix the salad_dressing.
     Do n't forget the joys of a meal on_the_road.
   If you travel over the vast U._S._A. you will , no_doubt , discover that feeding is an expensive business.
   Decide in_the_beginning to put your barbecue equipment to work.
   You can take it with you - a picnic bag , a grill , a cooler for soft_drinks and beer , and for frozen convenience_foods.
   Eat in a restaurant or motel mornings and evenings ; or just evenings.
   Turn_off at any one of the marked picnic_areas ( gasoline companies have touring service_bureaus that issue booklets on national_parks to tell you where you have barbecue facilities ) and - with soft_drinks cooled from morning loading_up , hamburger , buns , an array of relishes , and fresh fruit - your lunch is 75 % cheaper than at a restaurant , and 100 % more fun.
   You need a_little stove , a coffee_pot and a stew pot ; maybe a skillet , a basket of essentials like salt , pepper , plates , forks , knives and a can_opener.
   As you pull_out of your motel or national_park home-for-the-night , visit a market and buy just what you need for the next meal.
   For 25 c load_up the cooler with ice and keep cool pop_in the car.
     Spice is a fact of life in the U._S._A..
   You only have_to think_of franks and sausages to know what I mean.
   Go a step further and list all the wonderful barbecue basics - cervelat , salami , Vienna_sausages , mettwurst , bratwurst , bockwurst , knackwurst , Bologna , pepperoni , blutwurst - and you have a long list of easy specialties.
   Threaded on a skewer with new boiled potatoes , a_bit of green_pepper , a fresh white mushroom - any one of these spiced meats makes a man a cook , and a meal a feast.
     Sure , for the_most of us , a frankfurter is the favorite.
   A story goes that a certain Herr_Feuchtwanger of St._Louis , around 1883 served his sausages ( grilled ) and mustard to his fancy customers.
   So_that his customers should not soil their hands , Feuchtwanger issued white gloves.
   Discovery that the gloves frequently left with the customers made the wise peddler of spiced sausage-meat come_upon a compromise.
   He had a bakery make buns sized to fit his franks.
   Years later , franks-in-buns were accepted as the  first to go  at the New_York Polo Grounds.
     The nations 's number_one picnic treat is the skinless frankfurter - toasted over a bonfire on the beach or , more sedately , charcoal broiled on a portable grill.
   Either way it 's hard to beat in flavor as_well as ease of preparation.
   To make the picnic frank come_close to perfection , remember these tips :     - Score each frankfurter in four or five places about a third of the way through.
   This permits the juices to permeate the meat during cooking.
     - Relishes are as vital to the success of the frank as are buns.
   Bring along the conventional ones - catsup , pickle relish , mustard , mayonnaise - plus a_few extras , such_as tangy barbecue_sauce , chive cream_cheese , or horse-radish for the brave ones in the crowd.
     - Using a portable grill permits you to toast the buns , too.
   Watch closely while browning them , as it does n't take long.
     - An unusual flavor can be achieved by marinating the franks in French_dressing or a mixture of honey , lemon_juice and brown_sugar prior to the picnic.
   Broil or toast as_usual.
     Contrary to popular_opinion ,  a_la_mode  does n't mean  with ice_cream  - it just means , in the latest style.
   Here are a_couple_of the latest , highly styled ways to fix skinless franks in your own back yard!
   You 'll have the neighbor 's eyes popping as_well as their mouths watering!
     1 cup chili_sauce 1 3 cup water 1 tablespoon barbecue_sauce 2 teaspoons prepared mustard 1 2 pound chipped , spiced ham 6 sandwich buns , heated Combine first 4 ingredients in saucepan ; heat thoroughly.
   Add ham ; heat.
   Serve on buns.
   Makes 6 barbecues.
     You 'll never hear  sayonara  , the Japanese word for goodbye , from your guests when you give a hibachi party.
   The fun of toasting their own sausages over the small Oriental charcoal_burners and dipping them in tasty sauces will keep your group busy - try it and see!
     1 large onion , chopped fine 2 tablespoons salad_oil 1 8 - oz. can crushed pineapple and 1 2 cup of the juice 1 4 cup brown_sugar 2 tablespoons vinegar 1 tablespoon prepared mustard 1 tablespoon Worcestershire_sauce 2 tablespoons dry mustard Water 1 2 cup heavy_cream , whipped Salt Paprika Spear canned cocktail franks with picks.
   Also spear pineapple chunks and place in separate bowl.
     Make sauces ahead.
   Sweet-sour sauce can be kept warm over a second hibachi or chafing_dish while charcoal in broiler is reaching glowing coal stage.
   Mustard cream , used as alternate dip for franks and pineapple tidbits , tastes best when served at room_temperature.
     For sweet-sour sauce , cook onion in oil until soft.
   Add remaining ingredients and bring to a boil.
   Simmer about 10 minutes , and keep warm for serving.
     To prepare mustard cream , blend mustard with enough water to make a thin paste.
   Fold into whipped_cream and add a dash of salt and sprinkling of paprika.
     A back-yard picnic with grilled frankfurters and a selection of frankfurter trimmings is a fine way to entertain guests this summer.
   Be sure to have plenty of frankfurters and buns on_hand.
   Some tasty frank toppings are chili_con_carne , Coney_Island sauce and savory sauerkraut.
   Serve the chili and kraut hot with the franks.
     Here are suggestions for the frankfurter trimmings :     Chili_con_carne : use canned chili_con_carne.
     Coney_Island sauce : finely chop several onions and add enough catsup to moisten well ; add prepared mustard to suit taste.
     Savory sauerkraut : add several tablespoons of brown_sugar to a can of sauerkraut.
   Add a_few caraway_seeds , too , if you 'd like.
     1 2 cup minced celery 1 4 cup minced onion 1 2 cup tomato ketchup 1 2 cup water 1 4 cup vinegar 2 tablespoons brown_sugar 1 tablespoon Worcestershire_sauce 1 tablespoon prepared mustard 1 2 teaspoon salt 8 frankfurters Combine first 9 ingredients in skillet.
   Simmer 15_minutes.
   Prick frankfurters with fork ; place in sauce.
   Cover ; simmer 15_minutes , stirring occasionally , until sauce is of desired consistency.
   Serve in frankfurter_buns or as a meat dish.
   Makes 8 sandwiches or 4 servings.
     Make criss-cross gashes on_one_side of skinless frankfurters.
   Stick 4 or 5 cloves in each frank , ham fashion.
   Make a paste of brown_sugar and mustard and spread lightly over scored surface.
   If desired , sprinkle with 1 teaspoon drained crushed pineapple.
   Place on rectangle of foil and pinch edges together tightly.
   Roast on grill over coals 15 - 20 minutes.
     Blend 2 cups biscuit mix with 2 3 cup milk to make a soft dough.
   Knead on lightly floured board and roll_out to form a * * f-inch rectangle.
   Spread dough with a mixture of 3 tablespoons chili_sauce , 1 teaspoon horse-radish and 2 teaspoons mustard.
   Cut dough carefully into 12 strips , about 3 4 inch by a foot long.
   Twist one strip diagonally around each skinless frankfurter , pinching dough at ends to seal it.
   Brush frankfurter twists with about 1 2 cup melted butter and toast slowly over glowing coals until dough is golden brown.
   Serves 12.
     1 pound ground_beef 2 teaspoons grated onion Dash of pepper 1 2 teaspoon salt 1 2 cup chopped walnuts 1 4 cup ice cold bourbon Combine ingredients ; form into patties and barbecue 5 minutes on each side.
    
    Directions are written for those who have had previous experience in making pottery.
   Instructions for preparing clay , drying , glazing and firing are not given.
     Basic pottery studio equipment.
   Wooden butter molds and cookie presses.
     Ceramic modeling clay : red , white or buff.
   Stoneware clay for tiles.
   Glazes , one-stroke ceramic colors , stains , cones as indicated in the individual instructions.
     Use well-wedged clay , free_of air_bubbles and pliable enough to bend without cracking.
   Clean wooden molds and presses thoroughly ; they must be free_of oil , wax and dust.
     The size of wooden mold will determine the amount of clay needed.
   Roll clay to thickness indicated in individual instructions.
   Whenever possible , use the wooden mold as a pattern for cutting clay.
   When mold has more_than one design cavity , make individual paper patterns.
   Place mold or paper pattern on rolled clay and cut clay by holding knife in vertical position ( cut more pieces than required for project to make allowance for defects ; experiment with defects for decoration techniques of glazes and colors ).
   Place the cut clay piece loosely over the carved cavity design side of wooden mold.
   To obtain clear impression of mold , press clay gently but firmly into mold cavity , starting at center and working to outer edges.
   Trim excess clay away from outer edges.
   Check thickness of clay and build_up thin areas by moistening surface with a_little water and adding small pieces of clay.
   Be sure to press the additional clay firmly into place without locking_in air_bubbles.
   Allow project to stand for about five minutes ( if wooden press mold is a good antique , do not leave clay in too long as the dampness may cause mold to crack ).
     To release clay from mold , place hands in a cupped position around project ; gently lift the edge on far side , then continue to release edge completely around mold.
   Slight tapping on the underside of mold will help release the clay , but too_much agitation will cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with removal of clay from mold.
   Place a_piece of plaster wall board or plaster bat on clay and reverse bat , clay and mold in one action.
   This will prevent the clay from twisting or bending , causing warping when fired.
   Place project on table and carefully lift the mold off.
   Study surface of clay for defects or desired corrections.
   If clay is slightly out of shape , square straight sides with guide sticks or rulers pressed against opposite sides , or smooth round pieces with damp fingers.
   if the background of design is too smooth , or you wish to create a wood-grained effect , it may be_added at this time with a dull tool such_as the handle of a fine paintbrush.
   Make slight , smooth grooves rather_than cuts for the texture ( cuts could cause air_pockets under the glaze creating pinholes or craters in the glaze during firing ).
   Leave the clay on plaster board to dry slowly , covered lightly with a loose piece of plastic or cloth to prevent warping.
     ( opposite page , right top ) : Stoneware clay was used.
   Clay was rolled to 1 4  thickness.

   Score one side of disk D , join to C ; score other side of D and one side of disk E and join as before.
   While assembled lid is still on design head , gently but firmly press it on plaster board.
   If design head has a deep cavity , clay lid will be quite thick at this point ; press eraser of pencil gently 1 4  deep into deep clay to allow vent for proper drying and firing.
   Check fit of lid on jar ; if inner lid is too big , trim to fit , allowing room for thickness of glaze.
   Remove lid from head of mold.
   Remove jar from mold.
   Place jar on plaster board with lid in_place to dry slowly.

     Use mold to cut four side pieces.
   For top and bottom pieces , use short end of mold as measurement guide.
   Press the side pieces of clay into cavity of mold.
   Trim excess clay from rim of mold.
   Cut beveled edge on the long sides of clay at a 45 ` angle to miter corners.
   Score beveled edges and remove pieces from mold ; place design-side up_on plaster board.
   Make all four sides.
   Cut clay top and base pieces ; place on plaster board.
   Allow all pieces to become leather hard before constructing shaker.
     Construct sides , bottom and top as for box , using slip on scored edges and coils of clay to reinforce seams.
   Join the four sides together first , then add the base ; add top last.
   Use water on finger to smooth seams and edges.
   Turn shaker upside_down.
   Recess base slightly to allow room for stopper.
   Cut hole in base for cork stopper.
   Add holes in top , forming  S  for salt and  P  for pepper.
   Set aside to dry thoroughly.
     Cut a strip of clay for sides long enough and wide enough for three impressions of mold design.
   Press clay into cavity of one mold three_times ; bevel overlapping ends for splice joint , score beveled edges.
   Form clay strip into a cylinder ; use slip to join scored ends.
   Place cylinder on a disk of clay slightly larger than cylinder.
   Score bottom edge of cylinder and join to disk with slip.
   Trim away excess clay ; reinforce seam with a coil of clay.
   This will form the sugar_bowl.
   Make creamer the same.
     Handle for creamer is a strip of clay 1 2  wide and 3 - 1 2  long.
   To add handle , place a wooden dowel against the inside wall of creamer.
   Score outside of container where handle ends will be joined.
   Bend handle ; press scored handle ends firmly in_place using dowel to reinforce container while pressing ; use slip to join.
   To form spout , between two designs , dampen area slightly and gently push clay outward.
   Make lid for sugar_bowl the same as jar lids , omitting design disk.
   Cut a notch in lid for spoon handle if desired.
   Set aside to dry with lid on sugar_bowl.
     Make same as salt and pepper shakers , leaving_off top pieces.

   Press the two sides into cavity of one mold three_times.
   Put cut pieces on plaster board to dry to firm leather-hard state.
   Score side edges of base ; join sides and base with slip and reinforce with coil.
   A cardboard pattern cut to fit inside holder will help to prevent warping.
   Place pattern inside holder ; use three strips of clay to hold in place ( see Fig. 2 , page 71 ).
   Do not use wood as it will not shrink with the clay and would cause breakage.
     Let all projects dry slowly for several days.

    Hotei is 23 feet long with an 8 - 1 2 - foot beam and every_inch a family boat.
   Menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the helmsman has a clear view.
   Youngsters can sleep or amuse themselves safely in the large cabin which has 5 - foot 11 - inch headroom , bunks for three , galley and marine toilet.
   The gals can sun themselves in the roomy aft cockpit.
   All are well distributed , not crowded_together near the stern.
   And with passenger weight shifted forward , Hotei levels_off for speed under power of a Merc 800.
   The 80 - hp motor drives her at 25 mph with six aboard!
     With only two aboard , Hotei does better than 27 mph - and she gives a comfortable ride at this speed even in a three-foot chop.
   She also banks into a turn like a fine runabout - not digging in on_the_outside to throw passengers all_over the boat like many_a small cabin_cruiser.
   Nor is she a wet boat.
   We 've been out in five-foot waves and stayed dry.
     A_lot_of thought went into storage_space construction.
   There 's a large compartment in the forward cockpit for charts and other items.
   The cabin has several shelves for small items and storage under the bunks for water skiis , life_jackets , etc..
   The aft cockpit has a * * f storage bin over six feet long that doubles as a seat.
   On each side of the motor well there 's storage for battery , bumpers , line and spare props with six-gallon gas_tanks below.
   The well itself is designed to take two Merc 800 's or 500 's if you wish and there 's room for a 25 - gallon long-cruise gas_tank below it.
     Needless to say , you can n't build Hotei in a_couple_of weeks.
   Our building time was slightly over 400 hours - but the total cost for the hull with Fiberglas bottom , sink , head and hardware was under $ 800.
   A comparable manufactured boat would cost close_to $ 3000.
   Consider what you have_to earn to be able to spend the $ 3000 and your building time is well worth it.
   A Gator trailer , Model 565 , is used to transport the boat to the waterways.
   This piece of equipment costs a_little over $ 600 but it will save you that in mooring and hauling fees in a_few years.
     All framing in Hotei is one-inch mahogany which , in the dressed state you buy it , is about the 13 16 - inch thickness specified in the drawings.
   Therefore , the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens , etc. , on a table saw.
   Besides flathead bronze screws , silicon bronze Stronghold nails ( made by Independent_Nail + Packing_Co. , Bridgewater , Mass.
 ) are used extensively in assembly and Weldwood resorcinal glue is used in_all the joints.
     Construction follows a thorough study of the drawings.
   Start by laying_out the six frames and the transom on a_level floor.
   Draw each outline in a different-color chalk , one on top of the other.
   In_this_way you will be able to detect any obvious mistakes.
     The transom frame is made first with the joints lapped , glued and fastened with one-inch , No. 12 Stronghold nails.
   After notching it for the keelson , chines and battens , the half-inch plywood transom is secured to_it with glue and the same type nails.
   All frames are butted at the joints and 3 8 - inch plywood gussets are glued and nailed on each side of each joint , again using the one-inch , No. 12 nails.
   The frames are notched only for the keelson and the chines.
   If notched for the battens , they would require more work , be weakened and limber holes would have_to be bored so_that bilge water could flow through.
   Nowhere in the boat do the frames come in contact with the plywood planking.
     The jig is_erected after the frames and transom are complete.
   This is an important step because any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull as you advance in construction.
   Be sure all members are parallel , vertical and level as_required.
     After the frames and transom are set_up on the jig and temporarily braced , a_piece of three-inch-wide mahogany ( only widths will be given since the 13 16 - inch thickness is used throughout ) is butted between frames one and two below the line of the keelson.
   The frames are glued and screwed to this piece.
   The joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated Fiberglas cloth and nailed.
   It is over this piece that the laminated stem and keelson are spliced.
     The keelson , made of two three-inch widths , is_next installed.
   The first piece is glued and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames one and two.
   The second piece is in_turn glued and screwed to the first.
   Note , however , that it is six inches shorter at the forward end.
   One-inch , No.
10 screws are used in both cases.
     A stem jig is_next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to frame one.
   The stem is laminated from four pieces.
   Take two three-inch-wide pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make the four.
   Then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and bend them into place on the jig.
   The first two pieces butt_against the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace between the first two frames.
   The second two pieces lap over the inner member of the keelson and butt_against the outer member.
   They 're glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson.
   A_number_of C clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets.
     All bottom battens are two inches wide.
   The side ones are a half-inch narrower.
   The battens are carefully fastened in_place after some necessary fairing on all frames.
   Glue and 1 - 1 2 - inch , No. 10 screws are used.
   Placement is important because the rear seat , bunks and front jump_seats rest_on or are fastened to many_of the side battens.
   With the exception of two battens , all run to the stem where they are glued and screwed after careful beveling.
   The chines go_in the same way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength and easier bending.
     Fairing is always a tedious job but the work can be cut_down considerably with a Skill planer and a simple jig.
   I clamped a 30 - inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer with a pair of Sure Grips.
   The aluminum , flush against the battens , acted_as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson to the proper bevels easily.
   If you do n't own a planer and do n't want to buy one , it 's well worth renting.
     The planking is five-ply , 3 8 - inch-thick Weldwood_Royal_Marine plywood.
   This can be obtained in 42 - inch widths 24 feet long.
   The 42 - inch width leaves very little waste.
   Four pieces are used.
   Plank the sides first , using glue and one-inch , No. 12 Stronghold nails at_all battens , the stem and the transom.
   Another person inside with a weight against each batten will help in the fastening.
   The best procedure is to have a_few friends hold the planking in_place while you mark it off.
   Then trim the excess.
   I used a Homemaster Routo-Jig made by Porter_Cable for this job.
   It 's good for cutting all the planking because it cuts with a bit-like blade at high rpm and does not chatter the plywood like a saber saw.
     When cut , the planking is clamped in_place for a final and careful trimming.
   Then it is marked on_the_inside where it comes in contact with the transom , frames , keelson and all the battens.
   It may then be pre drilled for the fastenings.
   The next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at the contact points.
   Then it is replaced and fastened.
   The bottom planking is applied in the same manner.
     After planking , the bottom gets a layer of Fiberglas.
   The spray rails are first glued on_the_outside and fastened from the inside with screws.
   Then the chines are rounded_off and the bottom is rough sanded in preparation.
   Since the sides are also covered up to the spray rails , they are also rough sanded in_that area.
   The cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at_a_time.
   A 50 - inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line by about three inches.
   Lay the cloth in_place and trim it to size.
   Then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin.
   When the resin has hardened , mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish.
   I used bright red , mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding the hardener.
   Using a cheap brush , coat one side of the bottom with the resin and_then apply the cloth.
   When the cloth is smooth , apply another coat of resin , spreading it with a paint_roller.
   Be sure it is well saturated and_then allow it to harden.
     When the whole bottom has hardened , use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth at the keel line and near the spray rail.
   Then lay a three-inch-wide strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to_the_point of the stem.
   Before the resin has hardened , screw a one-inch mahogany keel strip along the centerline.
   This protects the bottom in beaching.
   Fiberglas materials are available from Glass_Plastic_Supply_Co. , 1605 W._Elizabeth_ave. , Linden , N._J..
   They will also supply literature on application.
     The hull is now turned_over ( with the help of about seven friends ) and placed in a_level , well-braced position.
   I set it on the Gator trailer.
   I laid three layers of glass cloth on_the_inside of the stem , also installing a bow eye at this time.
   For added strength , I also fastened a small block on each side of every frame and batten joint.
   Again , these blocks were set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nailed.
     After trimming off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to fasten them to the jig at a working height , the top of the side planking is_installed.
   This is made_up of scraps left_over from the sides and bottom.
   These flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry.
   When they 're on , the top edges are planed even with the sheer batten.
     The sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from frame six to the transom , forming a real strong transom brace.
   Note another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between these pieces.
     The decking is quarter-inch mahogany marine plywood.
   All the flooring and the storage bin is half-inch exterior fir plywood.
   Most floor battens are glued and screwed to the flooring.
   The exception is where the flooring butts.
   These battens are glued and screwed to the frames.
     With all deck battens in_place , the bilge is cleaned and painted up_to the floor line.
   Use one coat of Firzite and one coat of marine paint.
   Bottoms of the floorboards are also painted and the flooring is then screwed in_place.
     After the decking is on , the cabin sides are_installed.
   They 're followed by the front and rear bulkheads as illustrated.
   The windshield glass is shatterproof and Plexiglas is used in the cabin.
     Inside , bunks are framed_up and installed as indicated.
   A head is a handy thing to have and I installed one under a removable section of the port bunk.
   The sink in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into the head and a five-gallon water_tank is mounted on the bulkhead above the sink.
   For padding the seats and bunks , I used Ensolite , Type M.
   Lightweight , non-absorbent , fire resistant and dimensionally stable , it is easily bonded to the wood with contact cement.
   Available in * * f sheets , it costs about a dollar a square_foot.
    
    You can build this vacation cottage yourself.
   It is a full scale , small , but efficient house that can become a year ' round retreat complete in every detail.
   Because of the unique design by the architect Egils_Hermanovski , you can build most_of it in your own home workshop in your spare_time.
   Most_of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials , and requires the use of only simple tools.
   On the following pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to your vacation cottage , from choosing the proper site to applying the final trim.
     In recognition of the growing trend for second homes , or vacation cottages , we have designed this one specifically with the family handyman in mind.
   It is a big project , not to be taken lightly.
   But each step has been broken_down into easy stages , utilizing standard materials and simple tools , well within the capabilities of the handyman.
     The idea behind our design is modular units , or panelization.
   Everything possible has been scaled to standard sizes and measurements of materials.
   Wall panels and structural timbers are standard as are windows and doors , making_for a minimum of cutting.
   We have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so_that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop , panel by panel , according to plan.
   Thus , when you have prepared your foundation and laid the floor , these can be trucked to the site and erected with a small crew of friends in a weekend.
   The roof timbers are precut and the panels standard so_that the house can be completely enclosed in a matter of three or four days.
   Then you can do the finishing touches at your leisure.
     Due_to the fact that building_codes and regulations vary so_much throughout the country , the first thing to do is to find_out what , if any , they are.
   Close_to a large city they might even specify the size of the nails used ; in a remote section there might be no restrictions at_all.
   This can usually be found_out at the nearest town_hall.
   At_the_same_time check the electrical , plumbing , and sanitary requirements , as_well as possible zoning regulations.
   Whether electricity and public water and sewers are available or not , check the local customs in the use of bottled or L-P gas ( we give you alternatives later_on ).
   Be sure that this information is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion.
   If there are any major restrictions , they usually can be obtained in printed form.
   Where a building_permit is required , find_out what you must present when applying for one.
   In many cases , you must file a complete set of plans with the local building inspector.
   These will be available at cost from our Plans Department.
     Some general things to look_for in a site , if you have n't already bought one , are accessibility , water drainage , and orientation.
   How are the roads , and_how will they stand_up?
   Is_there evidence of wash-outs on the property ; swampy areas or intermittent springs?
   A visit in the early spring after a thaw will be very informative.
   Note where the sun rises and sets , and ask which direction the prevailing_winds and storms come from.
   Will the view be something you can live with?
   Do n't worry too_much about rocky or sloping terrain ; we will take_up alternative foundations later_on.
     With this first issue we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic ( A version ) and the expandable ( B version ).
   This will be for the shell of the house only ( roof , walls , and floor ) , and does not include the carport or balcony.
   This will permit you to get a rough estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost.
   Bear_in_mind that this does not include interior panels for partitions , fancy flooring , appliances and fixtures , electrical wiring , and plumbing , all_of which will be taken_up in_detail in later issues.
     The wall panels are_constructed of a framework of standard * * f and * * f of a good grade , free from structural faults.
   They should be as straight as possible , as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when the walls are_erected.
   The outside surface of the solid units shall be of an exterior grade of panel board such_as plywood , plastic coated panel board , high density particle board , asbestos-cement board , or any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building supply dealer.
   The inner panels do not have_to be weatherproof , and the choice will depend_on the quality of finish desired.
   All panel board comes in standard * * f foot size.
   It is recommended that panels be both glued as_well as nailed to the frame.
   The fixed window panels with louvers should have a good grade of 1 8 - inch double-strength glass set in a mastic glazing compound.
   The louvers are_constructed as shown in the detail , with a drop door for ventilation.
   There are standard sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels requiring them.
   The door panels are designed to accommodate standard doors which should be of exterior grade.
   The filler panels for the gable_ends are cut from full * * f sheets as shown , leaving no wastage.
   The battens covering the joints are of * * f stock and are applied after the walls are_erected.
   All nails should be rustproof , and aluminum is highly recommended.
   Note : If 1 2 - inch panel board is used inside and out , or 5 8 - inch one side and 3 8 - inch the other , and 1 8 - inch glass is used , stock lumber in * * f , * * f , and * * f can be used in making the glass panels.
   Other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special size lumber for the glass trim.
   In_any_case , there is no special milling or rabbeting required for the panels.
     With modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting_tools , fixtures , and attachments available , the drill press has become a basic home workshop tool.
   The drill press consists_of a vertical shaft ( spindle ) which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a drill chuck , a tubular housing ( quill ) in_which the spindle is mounted , a head in_which the quill is mounted , a feed lever which moves the quill up or down , a power source , and a movable table upon_which the work is placed.
   There is often a means of locking the quill and , on larger presses , the table can be tilted.
     The size of the press is usually expressed in_terms_of chuck capacity ( the maximum diameter tool shank it will hold ) or distance between the spindle center and the column.
   A press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center of a 22 inch board or circle.
     A new radial drill press with a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done at any angle.
   The head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on the supporting column to position the drill_bit instead of the work.
     The drill press should be leveled and , depending_on whether it is a bench or floor model , bolted securely to a sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws.
   This will reduce vibration and increase accuracy.
     A coat of paste wax or a rubdown with a_piece of wax_paper will protect the polished surface of the table ; wiping with a slightly oiled cloth will discourage rusting of the column and quill.
   Presses not fitted with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now_and_then in the lubrication holes in the quill.
   The rest of the press should be kept clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush.
     Be careful to keep the drive belt free_of oil and grease.
   Belt tension is adjusted by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount.
   Keep the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won n't slip when pulled by_hand ; excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle bearings.
   Most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises the spindle automatically when the feed lever is_released and holds the quill in the raised position.
   The return spring tension may be adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing with a pair of pliers ( to prevent the spring from unwinding when it is_released ) , loosening the lock nut or screw , and rotating the housing until the desired tension is achieved.
   Turning the housing clockwise will reduce tension , counter-clockwise will increase it.
     Some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide a socket for the chuck key ; otherwise , you 'll have_to spend a_few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the bottom of the motor mount so_that the key is out_of_the_way when not in_use.
     Drill speeds are important if you want a good job.
   Each cutting_tool will operate best at a given speed , depending_on the material worked.
   On most drill presses , it is impossible to get the exact speed , but you can come close_by adjusting the drive belt on the step-cone pulleys.
   You will find a chart giving the various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere in the instruction booklet that came_with the tool.
   See the table on page 34 for exact recommended speeds.
   Generally , the larger the tool and the harder the material , the slower the speed.
     Feed pressure is also of major importance.
   Too_much pressure will force the tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed or broken tools.
   Too light a feed , particularly with metal or other hard material , causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting_edge.
   The best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even rate.
     There are numerous types and styles of tools to drill holes.
   The_most common are the twist_drill , the solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades , the double spur bit , and the power wood bit.
   All will do a good job if sharp , but the twist_drills do n't cut quite as smoothly as the others , since they do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual boring starts.
     The adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by reversing the cutter blade.
   Since fly cutters are one sided and not balanced , they should be used at the slowest speed available , and fed very slowly to avoid binding.
   Fly cutters can fool you into putting your hand too_close to the tool , so if you want to avoid nicked fingers , keep your hands well_out of the way.
     When drilling all_the_way through a workpiece , always place a_piece of scrap wood underneath.
   This will not_only protect the work_table , but also assure a clean breakthrough.
   Another method of assuring a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all_the_way through , then drill half_way with the dimensional bit , turn the piece over , and finish from the other side.
   In soft woods with pronounced grain , there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander , due_to the varying hardness of the wood.
   In_this case , drilling a small pilot hole or clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy.
     When a hole is to be bored to a predetermined depth , mark the depth on_the_side of the stock , then run the bit down so_that it is even with the mark.
   The depth gauge rod can now be set , and any number of holes bored to exact and identical depth.
    
    The old-time bridges over the Merrimac_River in Massachusetts are of unusual interest in many respects.
   For their length , their types of construction , their picturesque settings , and their literary associations , they should be known and remembered.
   In_this sequence I shall write_about them in the order of their erection.
     The first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in_part , - and perhaps the_most interesting one , connected Newbury ( now Newburyport ) with Salisbury_Point.
   Its building was first proposed in 1791 , when a group of citizens , mostly Newburyport men , petitioned the General_Court for an act of incorporation.
   This document began :      Whereas , a Bridge over Merrimack_River , from the Land of Hon ' ble Jonathan_Greenleaf , Esquire , in Newbery , to Deer_Island , and from said Island to Salisbury , would be of very extensive utility , by affording a safe Conveyance to Carriages , Teams and Travellers at_all seasons of the year , and at_all_Times of Tide.
      We , the Subscribers , do agree , that as soon as a convenient Number of Persons have subscribed to this , or a similar Writing , We will present a petition to the Hon ' ble General_Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , praying for an Act incorporating into a Body_politic the subscribers to such Writing with Liberty to build such a Bridge , and a Right to demand a Toll equal_to that received at Malden_Bridge , and on like Terms , and if such an Act shall be obtained , then we severally agree each with the others , that we will hold in the said Bridge the several shares set against our respective Names , the whole into two hundred shares being divided , and that we will pay such sums_of_Money at such Times and in such Manners , as by the said proposed Corporation , shall be directed and required .
     This paper was signed by forty-five persons , subscribing a total of two hundred shares.
     A month later the General_Court served notice to the town of Newbury that the bridge was to be_built.
   The_matter was considered and reconsidered , and finally opposed , but in_spite_of many objections , the Court granted a charter on January 9 , 1792.
   On November 26 of_that year the bridge was completed and opened.
     Timothy_Palmer , who invented and later patented the arch type of construction for wooden bridges , was the genius who planned and supervised the building of the Essex , or  Deer_Island  bridge although the actual work was carried_out under the direction of William_Coombs , who received 300 as recompense.
     This two-part bridge is best described by Rev._Timothy_Dwight , president of Yale_College , in his  Travels in New-England and New-York  , published in New_Haven in 1821.
   He says of_it :      It consists_of two divisions , separated by an island at a small distance from the southern shore.
   The division between the island and this shore , consists principally of an arch ; whose chord is one_hundred and sixty feet , and whose vortex is forty feet ( it was actually 37 feet ) above the high-water_mark.
   In appearance and construction it resembles the Pascataqua bridge.
   The whole length of Essex bridge is one_thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four.
   I have already mentioned that Mr._Timothy_Palmer of Newburyport was the inventor of the arched bridges in_this country.
   As Mr._Palmer was educated to house-building only , and had never seen a structure of_this nature ; he certainly deserves not a_little credit for the invention .
     It is hardly necessary to remind students of covered bridges that Timothy_Palmer was_born in 1751 in nearby Rowley ; that he moved with his parents to West_Boxford when he was sixteen years old ; and was_there apprenticed to a builder and architect , Moody_Spofford.
   It was indeed a remarkable feat that a man who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the principle of the arch , which appears in his famous bridges at Portsmouth , Haverhill , and Philadelphia.
     The Essex_Merrimack_Bridge when first built was not covered.
   As far as we know , no American bridge had been thus protected in 1792.
   Richard_S._Allen is the authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed by 1810.
   Its original appearance is_shown in an engraving published in the  Massachusetts_Magazine  in May 1793 , which is reproduced herewith ( Fig. 1 ).
   A brief description accompanying the picture says that the bridge contained more_than 6000 tons of timber.
   Between the abutments on the Newbury shore and the south bank of Deer_Island there was one span or arch measuring 160 feet ; between the north shore of Deer_Island and the Salisbury side there was an arch of 113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long.
     A dinner and celebration in honor of_this piece of engineering took_place July 4 , 1793 , in a tavern erected by the corporation on the island.
   It is said that the eccentric Timothy_Dexter , who was one of the first share-holders , stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the occasion.
   The  Essex_Journal  says that he  delivered an oration on the bridge , which for elegance of style , propriety of speech or force of argument , was truly Ciceronian .
   The reporter must have written this with tongue in cheek , because Dexter 's oration could hardly be_understood ; and , although he later explained that he was talking French , it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to the joys of the evening.
     The north portion of the Essex bridge was well worth the cost of construction , although it proved to be twice what was estimated in_the_beginning.
   It stood in its original form until 1882.
   The southern half , however , on account of its underbracing , was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation.
   In 1810 it was torn_down and replaced by a chain suspension_bridge.
   This was_built by John_Templeman from plans submitted by James_Finley of Fayette_County , Pennsylvania.
   Timothy_Palmer had general supervision of the work.
     An advertisement in the  Newburyport_Herald  , December 21 , 1810 , shows Palmer in a new light as an expert on chain bridges.
   It reads :      Information is hereby given that Mr._Timothy_Palmer of Newburyport , Mass. has agreed to take_charge of the concerns of the Patentees of the Chain Bridge , in the states of Massachusetts , New_Hampshire , Vermont , Rhode_Island , and Connecticut , so_far as relates to the sale of Patent_rights and the construction of Chain Bridges.
      Mr. Palmer will attend_to any applications relating to bridges and if desired will view the proposed site , and lay_out and superintend the work , or recommend a suitable person to execute it.
     John_Templeman  Approved , Timothy_Palmer  This chain bridge proved less durable than the wooden arch on the Salisbury end.
   It fell , February 6 , 1827 , carrying with_it a horse and wagon , two men and four oxen.
   The horse and men were saved , but the oxen drowned.
   In_spite_of this catastrophe , the bridge was rebuilt on the same plan and opened again on July 17 , 1827.
   This second chain bridge was 570 feet long , had two thirty-foot towers and a draw , and a double roadway.
     The Essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868 , when the County Commissioners laid_out all the Merrimack bridges as highways.
     Sturdy and strong after more_than a century of continuous use , the old covered , wooden bridge that spans the Tygartis_Valley_River at Philippi will have a distinctive part in the week-long observance of the first land battle of the Civil_War at its home site , May 28 th to June 3 rd.
   Colonel_Frederick_W._Lander , impersonated , will again make his break-neck ride down the steep declivity of Talbott 's ( now College ) Hill and thunder across the bridge to join Colonel_Benjamin_F._Kelley 's ( West ) Virginia_Infantry , then swarming through the streets in pursuit of the retreating Confederates.
   He was closely followed by the Ohio and Indiana troops - thus the old bridge has another distinction ; that of being the first such structure secured by force of arms in the war of the ' 60 s.
     The bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements , war , fire , and floods , as_well as injuries incident to heavy traffic , for more_than a_hundred years.
   Twice during the Civil_War it was saved from destruction by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister.
   It still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic on U._S._Route 250 - the old Beverly and Fairmont_Turnpike.
   It is one of the very_few , if_not the only surviving bridge of its type to serve a main artery of the U._S. highway_system , thus it is far more_than a relic of the horse and buggy days.
     This covered , wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action in the early morning of June 3 , 1861 , and with subsequent troop movements of both armies in the Philippi area that it has become a part and parcel of the war story.
   So frequently has pictures of the bridge appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the old John_Brown_Fort at Harpers_Ferry as the two nationally best known structures in West_Virginia.
     Completed and opened for traffic in 1852 , the bridge was designed and built by Lemuel_Chenoweth and his brother , Eli , of Beverly.
   The Chenoweth brothers were experienced bridge builders , and against the competition of other , and better known , bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of the covered , wooden bridges on the Parkersburg and Staunton_Turnpike a dozen years before , as_well as_many other bridges for several counties.
   The Philippi bridge , however , was the Chenoweth master piece , with its 139 - foot , dual lane , span - and it stands today as a monument to its builders.
   Never rebuilt , the bridge was strengthened in 1938 by two extra piers , a concrete floor , and a walk-way along the upper_side in_order_to care for modern traffic.
     During the war it was in constant use by the wagon_trains transporting supplies from the railhead at Grafton to the troops operating in the interior.
   Union soldiers at_times used it for sleeping quarters to escape_from the rain or other inclement weather , and some of them left momentoes of their stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams.
     But what the elements could not do was seriously threatened when Brigadier_General William_E. ( Grumble ) Jones reached Philippi while on the famous Jones-Imboden raid in May , 1863.
   General_Jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings , including the long bridge at Fairmont , and , after seeing a great drove of horses and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge , he sent his men to work piling combustibles in and around it.
   Reverend_Joshual_Corder , a Baptist minister , gathered a_few citizens of Southern sympathies , to call_on Jones and plead with him to spare the structure ; he reasoned and argued , pointing_out that Jones or other Confederate commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat.
   Jones relented , he did not order his men to apply the torch - the drove of livestock was driven up the valley , via Beverly , and across the mountains to feed and serve the Confederate army , while Jones and his raiders turned toward Buckhannon to join forces with Imboden.
     Again Reverend_Corder saved the bridge when Union soldiers planned to destroy it , after filling its two lanes with hay and straw - but for what reason is not recorded nor remembered , certainly not because of pressure from an opposing Confederate force.
   On the second occasion it took prayers as_well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their purpose.
     Centering around this historic old structure , a group of public-spirited Barbour_County citizens have organized and planned a week-long series of events , beginning on May 28 th and continuing through June 3 rd , to observe most appropriately the centennial of the first land engagement of the Civil_War at Philippi.
    
    It is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming_pool - eight enlightening , vigorous , rigorous , not wholly unrewarding years.
   We have learned a_lot - a dash of hydrochemistry here , a_bit about plumbing and pump-priming there.
   We have had sound grounding in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy.
   We have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard birds.
   True , our problems have lessened a_bit as more_and_more of our neighbors have built their own pools , thereby diluting our spectacular attractions.
   But problems cling_to pools , as any pool owner knows.
   So our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials , errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for_the_first_time - in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience.
     Position may not be everything , but in the case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties , social and / or physical.
   We speak from varying viewpoints.
   One of us has a pool set in a wooded area very near the house.
   The other has his pool far away from the house in a field high on a hill.
     If you are dreaming of a blue , shimmering pool right outside your living_room windows , close your eyes firmly and fill_in the picture with lots and lots_of children , damp towels , squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated plastic toys.
   You are likely to be nearer the truth.
     You can also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living_quarters , the greater the chance for violation of family privacy , annoying noise and the let 's - make-your-house-our-club attitude.
   On_the_other_hand , out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind when children cannot be easily observed and you have_to make a long trek to reach the pool.
     Another dilemma : As picturesque as a sylvan pond in the forest may be , trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being of a pool.
   Yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating lawn every time the grass is mowed.
     As in choosing a wife , it is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is_likely to be in bad_weather as_well as in good.
   In the colder climes , for_instance , you will have_to live through the many unglamorous winter months when your pool will hardly look its best.
   It may be a big hole_in_the_ground filled with salt hay , or an ice_floe studded with logs.
   Even a neat , plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold.
   ( We do , however , recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk - flora and fauna generally - from accidentally wintering in the pool.
 )     Probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts.
   Naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and size of your land.
   But if space and money are no problem and small children are not on_hand every_day , it is certainly more restful to have your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs of the house.
   And a good several feet around the pool should be neither greensward nor woods , but good hard pavement.
     The placement of your pool , however , will not of itself solve the two major problems of pool owning - those that involve your social life and those pertaining to safety.
   Coping_with them demands stern discipline - of yourself as_well as of your family , neighbors , friends and anyone you ever talked to on a transoceanic jet.
     Eight years ago while we were going_through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period , we were each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid_out nearby for the lord and master 's delectation.
   But not even our first pool-side gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies.
   We seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own backyards.
   Our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled.
   Had we taken a lien on a state park?
   Not_at_all.
   We had merely been discovered by the pool sharks.
   We were in business!
     From proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step - no_more_than the change from city clothes to trunks.
   Nai ^ ve of us , maybe , but the results of our impulsive invitations to  come over next summer and swim in our new pool  were both unexpected and unsettling.
     After the first few weeks , it was obvious that rules had_to be made , laid_down and obeyed - even if our popularity ratings became subnormal as a result.
   So rules we made , in unabashed collusion.
   Since our viewpoints in_this respect coincided precisely , we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single social code for pool owners.
     First_and_foremost : No one - no , not anyone - in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations to his or her own circle.
   Just short of forty lashes we finally managed to coerce our children to this view.
   Their friends and ours are welcome to share the pool , but on our terms and at our times.
     No friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at_least telephoning beforehand.
     No ringers , either - even if they are trailing legitimate invitees.
   We want_to know when the Potlatches telephone exactly how many they are planning to bring , so_that we won n't end_up with a splashing mob that looks_like Coney_Island in August.
     No young children may come without adults except for a specific , organized , chaperoned party.
   And accompanying adults are urged to keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities.
   A gaggle of gabbling mothers , backs to the pool , is no safeguard.
     No bottle pool is tolerated - bottle pool being our lingo for those who come to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk and run.
   ( Sanity , solvency and relations with our wine_merchant took a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood free-drink stop.
 )     We designated one_day a week as the time when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours.
   This has saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less brutal to the young  less fortunate  than ours.
     We also worked_out logistics for Sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco lunch en_famille.
   We gently usher them to an island of tables and chairs strategically placed on_the_far_side of the pool where they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides.
     All dressing ( undressing to be more exact ) must be done in our small bath house or at the swimmers ' homes.
   ( To avoid any possible excuse for a dripping parade through your house , it is a good idea to have a telephone_extension near the pool as_well as a direct outdoor route between the pool and the parking_area.
 )   We do , however , provide a limited number of extra suits , mainly for children , and we stock extra towels and a_few inexpensive bathing conveniences.
   Life-preservers , the buckle-on kapok-filled kind , are held in readiness , too , for the very young.
     Safety rules , of_course , are more important than all the others put_together.
     In many localities , now , the law requires all pools to be fenced , usually to a minimum height of 5 feet.
   But fenced or unfenced , no pool-side is the place for running or horseplay.
   We allow no underwater endurance_contests , either , or inexpert versions of water_polo.
     Diving_boards must have non-skid surfaces ( coco matting takes an awful beating from chlorine and rots quickly , but grit-impregnated paints are excellent ).
   And divers must be enjoined to look before they leap , either on top of someone else or onto a pool edge.
     Our pools also have wide , shallow steps - for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords.
     All bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool and drinking_glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups.
     When you first acquire a pool , we earnestly recommend - for your own mental_health - a good long chat with your insurance_agent.
   You should be prepared to cope_with any pitfall such_as plunges into empty pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as_well as summer lawsuits.
     Soignee pools , alas , do not just happen.
   They are the result of a constant and careful contest with the elements.
   Unless you want_to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many_of your leisure hours nursing your pool 's pristine purity , its care and feeding - from pH content to filtering and vacuuming - is best left to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service.
   Of_course , if your pool is close_to the house , your wife can always add it to her housekeeping chores ( you hope ).
   Or you can make pool care the price of swimming for teen-agers.
   Even_so , every pool owner , in_case of emergency , should have some idea of_what makes things work.
   A brief course in hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future crisis.
     A sudden high rise in temperature will turn your pool poison green overnight.
   You need more chlorine.
   The walls feel slippery.
   You need algaecide.
   With or without professional help , you will have_to be able to do some of these jobs yourself unless you have a full-time pool nurse.
     You should see_to_it that the trap , the dirt-catcher in_front of the filter , is always clean.
   A pool is no place for a shut trap.
     You should firmly insist that no bobby_pins or hair pins be worn in the water.
   When shed , they leave rust marks.
     You can hope against hope that come spring_cleaning , your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing and furbishing.
   It has happened.
     Many hours of spring_cleaning will be saved , however , if you remove the main drain grate when you close the pool season in the fall.
   As the pool is emptied , stand_by to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet.
   Much of the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp , but requires dynamite if allowed to dry.
   If you have a 6 - to 8 - inch drain pipe , you may easily wash_out all the debris when the grate is out.
   Of_course , when your 6 - inch torrent of water is released , it may cause a_lot_of comment as it passes_through or by neighboring properties.
   Do not forget this possibility.
     If your pool is located on or near sloping ground , it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping out the water and_then scooping_out all the debris.
     It may be true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene , but lights also attract all the insect life for miles around.
   Once on the water , these little visitors seldom leave , and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming problems as_well as providing a slapping good time for all those present.
   Often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light you need at much less expense.
     Our experience has taught us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible , from pipes to brushes.
   Follow pool-care instructions to_the_letter , and be sure that one person ( in the family or not ) is regularly responsible_for each aspect of the job , with no chance for claiming ,  It was n't my turn .
     Never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valves - even if the little boys do want to play space_ship.
   You may find yourself hitting bottom , literally , as you discover that water is running_out even while you are putting it in.
    
    Draw a line across_the_country at the latitude of lower Pennsylvania.
   Any house built now below that line without air conditioning will be obsolete in 10 years.
   Fortunately , it is the FHA which has arrived_at this conclusion , for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage , and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress.
   Even if you live above that line , the FHA will back you , for they have decided that the inclusion of air conditioning in_all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged.
     New simplified packaged units , recently devised prefabricated glass-fiber ducts , and improved add-on techniques make it possible to acquire a system for an 1800 - square-foot house for as little as $ 600 to $ 900.
   Two men can often do the installation in a day.
   You can install it yourself - this is a central system that will cool every part of your house.
   Its upkeep?
   No less an authority than the FHA concurs that the savings air conditioning makes possible more_than offset its operating_costs.
     Home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted.
   We know now that a 15 - degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually desirable , and accurate controls assure the comfort we want.
     We know , too , that health is never harmed by summer cooling.
   On_the_contrary , there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills.
   The filtered air benefits allergies , asthma , sinus , hay_fever.
   Control of temperature and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid.
   Heart_conditions and high_blood_pressure escape the stresses brought_on by oppressive heat.
     Housekeeping is easier.
   The cleaner air means less time spent pushing a vacuum , fewer trips to the dry_cleaners , lighter loads for the washing_machine.
   The need for reupholstering , redecorating , repainting becomes more infrequent.
   Clothes hold their shape better , and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words.
     It will improve your disposition.
   When you 're less fatigued , things just naturally look brighter.
   The children can have their daytime naps and hot meals , and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms.
   You 'll sleep longer and better , too , awake refreshed and free_of hot_weather nerves.
     You can forget about screens , and leave the storm_windows up all year around.
     Best_of_all , central air conditioning is something you can afford.
   Like its long-lived cousin , the refrigerator , a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years or more.
   That brings its per-year cost down mighty low.
     No_matter what style your home is , ranch , two-story , Colonial or contemporary , central air conditioning is easily installed.
   The equipment won n't take_up valuable space either.
   It can go_in out-of-the-way waste space.
     But there 's no denying that the easiest and most economical way to get year - ' round whole-house air conditioning is when you build.
   If that 's done , the house can be designed and oriented for best operation , and this can mean savings both in the size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself.
     If you can n't see_your_way_clear to have summer cooling included when building , by_all_means make provision for its easy adding later.
   Manufacturers have designed equipment for just such circumstances , and your savings over starting from_scratch will be substantial.
     If your house is to have a forced warm air system , cooling can be a part of_it.
   This costs less_than having a completely separate cooling_system , for your regular heating ductwork , filters and furnace blower do double duty for cooling.
   You can get year - ' round air conditioners in the same variety of styles in_which you buy a furnace alone - high or low boy , horizontal or counterflow.
   The units can be installed in basement , attic , crawlspace , or in a closet located in the living area.
   The cooling coil is located in the furnace 's outlet.
   From the coil small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set in the yard , garage , carport , or basement.
     If you plan to add cooling later to your heating_system , there are things to watch for.
   Be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed.
   They may be inaccessible later.
   Be sure your ducts and blower are big enough to handle cooling.
   This is especially important if you live in a mild-winter zone.
   Be sure you get a perimeter heating_system , and diffusers that will work as_well for cooling as they do for heating.
     You can get a hot water_system that will also work for cooling your house.
   For cooling , chilled water is circulated instead of hot water.
   Instead of radiators you 'll have cooling-heating units , each with its own thermostat.
   These systems are more expensive than year - ' round forced air systems.
   The minimum cost for an average one-story , 7 - room house with basement , is likely to run $ 1500 above the cost of the heating alone.
     If the problems of combining cooling with your heating are knotty , it may be cheaper to plan on a completely separate cooling_system.
   The simplest kind_of separate system uses a single , self-contained unit.
   It is , in_effect , an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts to distribute the cooled , cleaned , dehumidified air where it is wanted.
     In a long , rambling ranch , two such units can be installed , one serving the living area , the other the sleeping zone.
   In a two-story house , one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first_floor , another in the attic to cool the second.
   In each case , having separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of permitting individual zone control.
     One of the more remarkable of the new cooling_systems is one that can be switched to heating.
   As you know , a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping the heat out of_it and_then releasing this heat outdoors.
   A relatively simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so_that the machine literally runs backward , and the heat is extracted from outdoor air and turned indoors.
     Up until recently , this heat_pump method of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when outside temperatures were above 40 degrees.
   Now , the machine has been improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat at temperatures down to 15 degrees.
   You can get this added heating feature for as little as $ 200 more_than the price of cooling alone.
     Consider it as a standby setup , at negligible cost , for those emergencies when the furnace quits , a blizzard holds_up fuel delivery , or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you do n't want to start_up your whole heating plant.
     How large a cooling unit you need , and the method of its installation , depends_on a variety of factors.
   Among_other_things , besides the nature of your house and_how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from_the_outside , it will depend_upon your personal habits and the makeup of your family.
   Families with children usually do n't want the house quite so cool.
   If you are a party thrower , you may need added capacity.
   The body is a heat machine , and 20 to 25 guests can easily double your cooling load.
     Cooling requirements are best expressed in_terms_of BTU 's.
   A BTU is a unit of heat , and the BTU rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can pump out of your house in an hour.
   A very rough rule_of_thumb is that , under favorable conditions , you 'll need 15 BTU 's of cooling for every square_foot of your house.
   This is if outdoor temperatures have a high average of 95 degrees.
   You 'll need more if the high average is above that , less if it 's below.
     Coolers are also rated by tons.
   A ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by melting a ton of ice.
   By accepted definition , a 1 - ton conditioner will provide 12000 BTU of cooling in one hour.
     You may find a conditioner rated by horsepower.
   It is generally an inaccurate method of rating , for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor , and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you 'll get.
   A 1 - hp conditioner , for_example , may vary in effectiveness from under 8000 BTU to well over 10000 BTU.
     The safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit you need , rather_than trying to do this yourself.
     Do n't urge your builder to give you a_little extra cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough.
   Better to have your equipment slightly undersized than too big.
   Here 's why :     Reducing humidity is often as important as cooling.
   An oversize unit will cool off your house quickly , then shut_down for a long period.
   Before it cycles on again , humidity can build_up and make you uncomfortable even_though the temperature is still low.
   With a unit of the right size , a compressor will run continuously during hot_weather , reducing humidity as evenly as it does temperature.
     Attention to details can cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately.
   A well-designed , 1200 - square-foot house can be comfortably cooled and heated for as little as $ 128 a year , or $ 11 a month.
     If you have a house which heat does n't penetrate easily , your unit will have less heat to remove.
   Keep the direct sun from reaching the house and you 've won the first battle.
   In a new house , generous roof overhangs are a logical and effective solution.
   If the house you plan to buy or build won n't have big overhangs , you can still do a fair job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed trellises , fences and awnings.
     Shade_trees , too , are a big help , so keep them if you can.
   Drawn blinds and draperies do some good , but not_nearly as much_as shading devices on_the_outside of the house.
     The more directly the sun strikes walls and roof , the greater its heat impact.
   The way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling you 're going_to need.
   A shift in the walls , or a change in the roof slope , so the sun hits them more obliquely , can save you money.
     You can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun , double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation.
   Restrict large glass areas to_the_north and south_sides of the house.
   They 're easier to shade there.
   An attic space above insulation makes a house easier to cool.
   You 'll even gain by putting your water_heater outside the conditioned space , and using an electric_range instead of a gas one.
   Gas adds to the moisture load.
     Insulate , weatherstrip , double-glaze to the maximum.
   In insulation , the numbers to remember are 6 - 4 - 2.
   They stand_for 6 inches of mineral_wool insulation in the ceiling , 4 inches in the side walls , 2 inches in the floors.
   Such extra-thick insulation not_only permits a much smaller cooling installation , but will continue to reduce operating_expenses both in heating and cooling.
   A light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50 per_cent.
     It costs two to three_times as much to remove a BTU in summer as it does to add one in winter , so every solitary BTU is worth attention.
   You 'll foil them in droves , along with their pal humidity , by having and using a kitchen_range exhaust_fan , a bathroom ventilator for when you shower , and an outside vent for the clothes drier.
     It 's no use pretending that all conditioners are quiet , but the noise they produce can be kept to a minimum.
   Good workmanship is important in the installation , so if you 're doing your own contracting , do n't award the job on the basis of price alone.
     Avoid attic placement directly above a bedroom.
    
    In American romance , almost nothing rates higher than what the movie men have called  meeting cute  - that_is , boy-meets-girl seems more adorable if it does n't take_place in an atmosphere of correct and acute boredom.
   Just_about the_most enthralling real-life example of meeting cute is the Charles_MacArthur-Helen_Hayes saga :   reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts , but he said simultaneously ,  I wish they were emeralds .
   Aside from the comico-romantico content here , a good linguist-anthropologist could readily pick_up a_few other facts , especially if he had a_little more of the conversation to go_on.
     The way MacArthur said his line - if you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist - would probably have gone like this : Primary stresses on emeralds and wish ; note pitch 3 ( pretty high ) on emeralds but with a slight degree of drawl , one degree of oversoftness.
   Conclusions : The people involved ( and subsequent facts bear me out here ) knew clearly the relative values of peanuts and emeralds , both monetary and sentimental.
   And the drawling , oversoft voice of flirtation , though fairly overt , was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture.
     In_other_words , like automation machines designed to work in tandem , they shared the same programming , a mutual_understanding not_only of English words , but of the four stresses , pitches , and junctures that can change their meaning from black to white.
   At this point , unfortunately , romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture ; but consider , if you can bear it , what might have happened if MacArthur , for some perverse , undaunted reason , had made the same remark to an Eskimo girl in Eskimo.
   To her peanuts and emeralds would have been just_so much blubber.
   The point - quite simply - is this : words they might have had ; but communication , no.
     This basic_principle , the first in a richly knotted bundle , was conveyed to me by Dr._Henry_Lee_Smith , Jr. , at the University of Buffalo , where he heads the world 's first department_of_anthropology and linguistics.
   A brisk , amusing man , apparently constructed on an ingenious system of spring-joints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind , Smith began his academic career teaching speech to Barnard girls - a project considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about  a young rat named Arthur , who never could make_up his mind .
   Later , he became one of the central spirits of the Army Language Program and the language_school of Washington 's Foreign_Service_Institute.
   It was there , in the course of trying to prepare new men for the  culture shock  they might encounter in remote overseas posts , that he first began to develop a system of charting the  norms of human communication .
     To the trained ear of the linguist , talk has always revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker - such things as geographical origin and / or history , socio-economic identity , education.
   It is only fairly recently , however , that linguists have developed a systematic way of charting voices on_paper in_a_way that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure of human communication between two people.
   This , for obvious reasons , makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric interview , so useful , in_fact , that they have been successfully used to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy.
     In the early 1950 's , Smith , together with his distinguished colleague , George_Trager ( so austerely academic he sometimes fights his own evident charm ) , and a third man with the engaging name of Birdwhistell ( Ray ) , agreed on some basic premises about the three-part process that makes communication : ( 1 ) words or language ( 2 ) paralanguage , a set of phenomena including laughing , weeping , voice breaks , and  tone  of voice , and ( 3 ) kinesics , the technical name for gestures , facial_expressions , and body shifts - nodding or shaking the head ,  talking  with one 's hands , et cetera.
     Smith 's first workout with stresses , pitches , and junctures was based on mother , which spells , in our culture , a good_deal more_than bread alone.
   For_example , if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person , there are certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother.
   The usual U._S. norm would be : Middle pitches , slight pause ( juncture ) before mother , slight rise at the end.
   The symbols of mother 's status , here , are all usual for culture U._S._A..
   Quite other feelings are evidenced by this style : Note the drop to pitch 1 ( the lowest ) on mother with no rise at the end of the sentence ; this is a  fade  ending , and what you have here is a downtalking style of speech , expressing something less_than conventional respect for mother.
   Even_less regard for mom and mom 's apple_pie goes_with : In_other_words , the way the speaker relates to mother is clearly indicated.
   And while the meaning of the words is not in_this instance altered , the quality of communication in both the second and third examples is definitely impaired.
   An accompanying record of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a throaty rasp.
   With this seven-word sentence - though the speaker undoubtedly thought he was dealing only with the subject of food - he was telling things about himself and , in the last two examples , revealing that he had departed from the customs of his culture.
     The joint investigations of linguistics and psychiatry have established , in_point_of_fact , that no_matter what the subject of conversation is or what words are_involved , it is impossible for people to talk at_all without telling over_and_over_again what sort_of people they are and_how they relate to the rest of the world.
   Since interviewing is the basic therapeutic and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry , the recording of interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of Redstone proportions in new research and training.
   Some of the earliest recordings , made in the 1940 's , demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track , whereas written_records of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which - if they were at_all discernible in print - were picked_up only by the_most skilled and sensitive experts.
   In a general way , psychiatrists were able to establish on a wide basis what many_of them had always felt - that the_most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic , that such things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not necessarily by words.
     At a minimum , recording - usually on tape , which is now in wide professional use - brings the psychiatric interview alive so_that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored repeatedly by the therapist or by a_battery of therapists.
   Newest_to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried that minimum to a new level.
   By adding a systematic analysis with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews , they have supplied a new set of techniques for the therapist.
   Linguistic charting of the transcribed interview flags points where the patient 's voice departs from expected norms.
   It flags such possible breakdowns of communication as rehearsed dialogue , the note of disapproval , ambivalence or ambiguity , annoyance , resentment , and the disinclination to speak at_all - this last often marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences.
     Interpretation , naturally , remains the role of the therapist , but orientation - not_only the patient 's vocal giveaways of geographical and socio-economic background , but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways of danger spots in his relationship to people - can be considerably beefed_up by the linguist.
   His esoteric chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties , making them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient.
   In one now-historic first interview , for_example , the transcript ( reproduced from the book , The First Five Minutes ) goes like this : The therapist 's level tone is bland and neutral - he has , for_example , avoided stressing  you  , which would imply disapproval ; or surprise , which would set the patient apart from other people.
   The patient , on_the_other_hand , is far from neutral ; aside from her specifically regional accent , she reveals by the use of the triad ,  irritable , tense , depressed  , a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language ( i. e. , she must have had at_least a high-school education ) , and she is telling a story she has mentally rehearsed some time before.
   Then she catapults_into  everything and everybody  , putting particular violence on  everybody  , indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag - that_is , it is not congruent to the patient 's general style of speech up_to this point.
   Consequently , it is referred to the therapist for attention.
   He may then very_well conclude that  everybody  is probably not the true target of her resentment.
   Immediately thereafter , the patient fractures her rehearsed story , veering into an oversoft , breathy , sloppily articulated ,  I do n't feel_like talking right_now .
     Within the first five minutes of_this interview it is apparent to the therapist that  everybody  truthfully refers to the woman 's husband.
   She says later , but still within the opening five minutes ,  I keep thinking_of a divorce but that 's another emotional death .
     The linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are all present in the voice chart for this sentence ; so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce.
   By saying  another emotional death  , she reveals that there has been a previous one , although she has not described it in words.
   This the therapist may pursue in later questioning.
   The phrase ,  emotional death  , interesting and , to a non-scientific mind , rather touching , suggests that this woman may have some flair for words , perhaps even something of the temperament regrettably called  creative .
     Since the psychiatric interview , like any other interview , depends_on communication , it is significant to note that the therapist in_this interview was a man of marked skill and long experience.
   His own communication apparatus operated superbly , and Lillian_Ross readers will note instantly its total lack of resemblance to the blunted , monumentally unmeshed mechanism of Dr._Blauberman.
   Interestingly enough - although none of the real-life therapists involved could conceivably compare with Blauberman - when groups of them began playing_back interviews , they discovered any number of ways in_which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques ; almost everyone , on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape , expressed some desire to take the whole_thing over_again.
     Yet , in_spite_of this , intensive study of the taped interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid_bare the surprising fact that , in the first five minutes of an initial interview , the patient often reveals as_many as a dozen times just what 's wrong with him ; to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen.
   Naturally , the patient does not say ,  I hate my father  , or  Sibling rivalry is what bugs me .
   What he does do is give himself away by communicating information over and above the words involved.
   Some of the classic indicators , as described by Drs._Pittenger , Hockett , and Danehy in The First Five Minutes , are these :     Stammering or repetition of I , you , he , she , et cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty.
   On_the_other_hand significant facts may be concealed - she may mean I ; or everybody , as it did with the tense and irritable woman mentioned before , may refer to a specific person.
   The word that_is not used can be as important as the word that_is used ; therapist and / or linguist must always consider the alternatives.
   When someone says , for_example ,  They took X_rays to see that there was nothing wrong with me  , it pays to consider how this statement would normally be made.
   ( This patient , in actuality , was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the fact that it was not her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty.
 )   Amateur linguists note here that Pursewarden , in Durrell 's Alexandria_Quartet , stammered when he spoke of his wife , which is hardly surprising in_view of their disastrous relationship.
    
    She was just another freighter from the States , and she seemed as commonplace as her name.
   She was the John_Harvey , one of those Atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to Bari to bring beans , bombs , and bullets to the U._S._Fifteenth Air_Force , to Field_Marshal Montgomery 's Eighth_Army then racing up the calf of the boot of Italy in_that early December of 1943.
     The John_Harvey arrived in Bari , a port on the Adriatic , on November 28 th , making for Porto_Nuovo , which , as the name indicates , was the ancient city 's new and modern harbor.
   Hardly anyone ashore marked her as she anchored stern-to off Berth 29 on the mole.
   If anyone thought_of the John_Harvey , it was to observe that she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden with high_explosive and if they were hit the John_Harvey would likely be blown_up with her own ammo and whatever else it was that she carried.
     Which was poison_gas.
     It had required the approval of President Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt before the John_Harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of mustard_gas and despatched to the Italian warfront.
   For in a world as_yet unacquainted_with the horrors of the mushroom_cloud , poison_gas was still regarded_as the ultimate in hideous weapons.
     Throughout the early years of World_War 2 , , reports persisted that the Axis powers had used gas - Germany in Russia , Japan in China again.
   They were always denied.
   Influential people in America were warning the Pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by the Germans in future campaigns.
   Some extremists went so_far as to urge our using it first.
   To silence extremists , to warn the Axis , President_Roosevelt issued this statement for the Allies in August :      From_time_to_time since the present war began there have been reports that one or more of the Axis powers were seriously contemplating use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices of warfare.
   I have been loath to believe that any nation , even our present enemies , could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such terrible and inhumane weapons.
      However , evidence that the Axis powers are making significant preparations indicative_of such an intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety of sources.
      Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general opinion of civilized mankind.
   This country has not used them , and I hope that we never will be compelled to use them.
   I state categorically that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons unless they are first used by our enemies .
     The following month the invasion of Italy was begun , and Roosevelt gave effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison_gas in southern Italy.
   Bari was chosen as a depot , not_only for its seeming safety , but because of its proximity to airfields.
   Any retaliatory gas attack would be airborne.
   It would be made in three waves - the first to lay_down a smokescreen , the second to drop the gas bombs , the third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below.
     So the vile cargo went_into the hole of the John_Harvey.
   A detachment of six men from the 701 st Chemical_Maintenance_Company under First_Lt._Howard_D._Beckstrom went aboard , followed by Lt._Thomas_H._Richardson , the Cargo_Security_Officer.
   Secrecy was paramount.
   Only a_few other people - very important people - knew of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks.
   No one else must know.
   Thus , in the immemorial way - in the way of the right_hand that knows and the left that does not - was the stage set for tragedy at Bari.
     It was the night of December 2 , 1943 , and it was growing dark in Bari.
   It was getting_on toward 7 o ' clock and the German Me-210 plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit.
   Capt._A._B._Jenks of the Office of Harbor_Defense was very worried.
   He knew that German long-range bombers had been returning to the attack in Italy.
   On November 24 th , they had made a raid on La_Maddalena.
   Two days later , some 30 of them had struck at a convoy off Bougie , sinking a troopship - and it had been that very night that the Me-210 had made its first_appearance.
   After it had reappeared the next two nights , Jenks went_to higher headquarters and said :      For three days now a German reconnaissance plane has been over the city taking pictures.
   They 're just waiting for the proper time to come over_here and dump this place into the Adriatic .
     But the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist.
   Even_though it was known that the Luftwaffe in_the_north was now being directed by the young and energetic General_Peltz , the commander who would conduct the  Little_Blitz  on London in 1944 , a major raid on Bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered seriously.
   True , there had been raids on Naples - but Naples was pretty far north on the opposite coast.
   No , Bari was out of range.
   More_than that , Allied air had complete superiority in the Eighth_Army 's sector.
   So Captain_Jenks returned to his harbor post to watch the scouting plane put_in five more appearances , and to feel the certainty of_this dread rising within him.
   For Jenks knew that Bari 's defenses were made of paper.
   The Royal Air_Force had but a single light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available.
   There were no R._A._F. fighter squadrons on Bari airfield.
   The radar station with the best location was still not serviceable.
   Telephone communication was bad.
   And everywhere in_evidence among the few remaining defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster - multiple command.
     It had been made shockingly evident that very morning to Ensign_Kay_K._Vesole , in charge of the armed guard aboard the John_Bascom.
   A British officer had come aboard and told him that in_case of enemy air_attack he was not to open_fire until bombs were actually dropped.
   Then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a radar-controlled shore gun firing white tracers.
      This harbor is a bomber 's paradise  , the Britisher had said with frank grimness.
    It 's up_to you to protect yourselves.
   We can n't expect any help from the fighters at Foggia , either.
   They 're all being used on offensive missions .
     Vesole had been stunned.
   Not fire until the bombs came_down!
   He thought_of the tons and tons of flammable fluid beneath his feet and shook his head.
   Like_hell!
   Like_hell he 'd wait - and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked_out?
   What would his guns guide_on then - the North_Star?
   Ensign_Vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering of the bombs , and when night began to fall , he put Seaman 2 / c Donald_L._Norton and Seaman 1 / c William_A._Rochford on the guns and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette.
   Below decks , Seaman 1 / c Stanley_Bishop had begun to write a letter home.
     Above decks on the John_Harvey , Lieutenant_Richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and felt uneasy.
   There were lights glinting in the city , too , even_though it was now dark enough for a_few stars to become visible.
   Bari was asking_for_it , he thought.
     For five days now , they had been in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold.
   Richardson wondered when it would be unloaded.
   He hoped they would put it somewhere way , way down in the earth.
   The burden of his secret was pressing_down_on him , as it was_on Lieutenant_Beckstrom and his six enlisted_men.
   Lieutenant_Richardson could envy the officers and men of the John_Harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing more dangerous than high_explosive bombs.
   They seemed happy at the delay in unloading , glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty port such_as Bari.
   Nine of them had gone down the gangplank already.
   Deck_Cadet_James_L._Cahill and Seaman_Walter_Brooks had been the first to leave.
   Richardson had returned their departing grins with the noncommittal nod that is the security officer 's stock in trade.
     The other half of the crew , plus Beckstrom and his men , had remained aboard.
   Richardson glanced to sea and started slightly.
   Damned if that was n't a sailing_ship standing_out of the old harbor - Porto_Vecchio.
   The night was so clear that Richardson had no difficulty making_out the silhouette.
   Then the thought of a cloudless sky made him shiver , and he glanced upward.
   His eyes boggled.
     It was a clear night and it was raining!
     Capt._Michael_A._Musmanno , Military_governor of the Sorrentine_Peninsula , had also seen and felt the  rain .
   But he had mistaken it for bugs.
     Captain_Musmanno 's renovated schooner with the flamboyant name Unsinkable had just left Porto_Vecchio with a cargo of badly-needed olive_oil for the Sorrentine 's civilian population.
   Musmanno was on deck.
   At exactly 7 : 30 , he felt a fluttering object brush his face.
   He snatched at it savagely.
   He turned the beam of his flashlight on_it.
   He laughed.
   It was the silver foil from the chocolate_bar he had been eating.
   He frowned.
   But how could -?
   Another , longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth.
   It was two feet long.
   It was not candy wrapping.
     It was  window  - the tinsel paper dropped by bombers to jam radar sets , to fill the scope with hundreds of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers.
      Fermate !
   Musmanno bellowed to his Italian crewmen.
    Stop!
   Stop the engines !
     Unsinkable slowed and stopped , hundreds of brilliant white flares swayed eerily down from the black , the air_raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek , the anti-aircraft guns coughed and chattered - and above it all motors roared and the bombs came whispering and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor at Bari.
     They had come from airports in the_Balkans , these hundred-odd Junkers 88 's.
   They had winged over the Adriatic , they had taken Bari by complete surprise and now they were battering her , attacking with deadly skill.
   They had ruined the radar warning system with their window , they had made themselves invisible above their flares.
   And they also had the lights of the city , the port wall lanterns , and a shore crane 's spotlight to guide_on.
   After the first two were blacked_out , the third light was abandoned by a terrified Italian crew , who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring homing beacon until British MP 's shot it out.
     In_that interval , the German bombers made a hell of Bari harbor.
     Merchant_ships illuminated in the light of the flares , made to seem like stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud , were impossible to miss.
   The little Unsinkable sank almost immediately.
   Captain_Musmanno roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive_oil together for a raft.
   They got it over the side and clambered aboard only a_few minutes before their schooner went_under.
     John_Bascom went_down early , too.
   Ensign_Vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly , but they had no targets.
   Most_of the Junkers were above the blinding light of the flares , and the radar-controlled shore gun had been knocked_out by one of the first sticks of bombs.
   Vesole rushed from gun to gun , attempting to direct fire.
   He was wounded , but fought on.
   Norton and Rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors.
   Bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20 mm gun , pumping out 400 rounds before sticks of three bombs each crashed into Holds One , Three and Five.
   Now the Bascom was mortally wounded.
   Luckily , she was not completely aflame and would go_down before the gasoline could erupt.
     The order to abandon ship was given , but cries of pain could be heard from the wounded below decks.
    
     The food is wonderful and it is a_lot_of fun to be here !
     So wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents from North_Country_School , Lake_Placid , New_York.
   In_this one sentence , he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological programs in_operation at the school.
     Because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value , care for its origin , and prepared in a manner that retains the_most nutrients , the food does taste good.
   When served in a psychological atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from what they eat because they are free from tension , a foundation is laid for a high level of health that releases the children from physical handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments , the athletic programs and the_most important phase , the educational opportunities.
     Situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain scenery in the country , the school buildings are located amid open fields and farm lands.
   These contemporary structures , beautifully adapted to a school in the country , are home to 60 children , ages eight to fourteen , grades four through eight.
   From fourteen states and three foreign countries they come to spend the months from mid-September to June.
     The Director , Walter_E._Clark , believes that a school with children living full_time in its care must take full responsibility for their welfare.
   To him this means caring for the whole child , providing basic nutrition , and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom for the development of the mind.
     The concept of good nutrition really began with the garden.
   The school has always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school.
   In a climate hostile to agriculture , Mr._Clark has had to keep alert to the_most productive farm techniques.
     Where a growing_season may , with luck , allow 60 days without frost , and where the soil is poor , sandy , quick-drying and subject_to erosion , many farmers fail.
   Throughout the Adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat.
     Mr._Clark found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing , use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides , plus the application of conservation principles of rotation and contouring , did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato fields and depreciation of the soil.
      To give_up these notions required a revolution in thought  , Mr._Clark said in reminiscing about the abrupt_changes in ideas he experienced when he began reading  Organic_Gardening  and  Modern_Nutrition  in a search for help with his problems.
      Louis_Bromfield 's writings excited me as a conservationist .
   By 1952 he was convinced he would no_longer spray.
   He locked his equipment in a cabinet where it still remains.
   After reading  Plowman 's Folly  by Edward_H._Faulkner , he stopped plowing.
     The basis for compost materials already existed on the school farm with a stable of animals for the riding program , poultry for eggs , pigs to eat garbage , a beef herd and wastes of all kinds.
   Separate pails were kept in the kitchen for coffee_grounds and egg shells.
     All these materials and supplementary manure and other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry farms made over 40 tons of finished compost a year.
   It was applied with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader.
     Years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity.
   Soon after the method changed , visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate his soil to keep it looking moist , when in_reality , it was the soil treatment alone that accomplished this.
     To demonstrate the soil of his vegetable_gardens as_it is today , Mr._Clark stooped to scoop_up a handful of rich dark earth.
   Sniffing its sweet smell and letting it fall to show its good crumbly consistency , he pointed to the nearby driveway and said ,  This soil used_to be like that hard packed road over there .
      People and soils respond slowly  , says Walter_Clark ,  but the time has now come when the gardens produce delicious long-keeping vegetables due_to this enrichment program.
   No chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides and fungicides are used .
     The garden supplies enough carrots , turnips , rutabagas , potatoes , beets , cabbage and squash to store for winter meals in the root_cellar.
   The carrots sometimes do n't make_it through the winter ; the cabbage and squash keep until March or April.
   There is never enough corn , peas or strawberries.
     Mr._Clark still has to use rotenone with potatoes grown on the_least fertile fields , but he has watched the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that continued use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in_the_future.
   A new project planned is the use of Bio-Dynamic_Starter.
     New ideas for improving nutrition came_with the study of soil treatment.
    After the soil , the kitchen  , says Mr._Clark.
   The first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of white_bread.
      Adults take a long_time to convince and you are thwarted if you try to push .
   At_first the kitchen help was tolerant , but ordered their own supply of white_bread for themselves.
    You can n't make French_toast with whole-wheat bread  , was an early complaint.
   Of_course they learned in_time that they not_only could use whole-wheat bread , but the children liked it better.
     Mrs._Clark , as house manager , planned the menus and cared for the ordering.
   Then Miss_Lillian_Colman came from Vermont to be kitchen manager.
   Today whole grains are freshly ground every_day and baked into bread.
   Mr._Clark 's studies taught him that the only way to conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt use of the flour.
   Once the grains are ground , vitamin_E begins to deteriorate immediately and half of_it is lost by oxidation and exposure to the air within one week.
     A mill stands in a room off the kitchen.
   Surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in the state.
   Miss_Colman pours measures of whole wheat , oats , and soy_beans and turns_on the motor.
   She goes_on about her work and listens for the completion of the grinding.
   The bread baked from this mixture is light in color and fragrant in aroma.
   It is well liked by the children and faculty.
     There is one problem with the bread.
    Lillian 's bread is so good and everything tastes so_much better here that it is hard not to eat too_much  , said the secretary ruefully eyeing her extra pounds.
     The school has not used cold prepared cereals for years , though at_one_time that was all they ever served.
   When the chance came , they first eliminated cold_cereal once a week , then gradually converted to hot fresh-ground cereal every_day.
     They serve cracked wheat , oats or cornmeal.
   Occasionally , the children find steamed , whole-wheat grains for cereal which they call  buckshot .
   At the beginning of the school_year , the new students do n't eat the cereal right_away , but within a short_time they are eating it voraciously.
     When they leave for vacations they miss the hot_cereal.
   The school has received letters from parents asking ,  What happened to Johnny?
   He never used_to like any hot_cereal , now that 's the only kind he wants.
   Where can we get this cereal he likes so_much ?
     Salads are served at_least once a day.
   Vegetables are served liberally.
   Most come from the root_cellar or from the freezer.
   Home-made sauerkraut is served once a week.
   Sprouted grains and seeds are used in salads and dishes such_as chop_suey.
   Sometimes sprouted wheat is_added to bread and causes the children to remark ,  Lillian , did you put nuts in the bread today ?
     Milk appears twice a day.
   The school raises enough poultry , pigs , and beef_cattle for most_of their needs.
   Lots_of cheese made from June_grass milk is served.
   Hens are kept on the range and roosters are kept with them for their fertility.
     Organ meats such_as beef and chicken_liver , tongue and heart are planned once a week.
   Also , salt water fish is on the table once a week.
     For deserts , puddings and pies are each served once a week.
   Most other desserts are fruit in some form , fresh fruits once daily at_least , sometimes at snack time.
   Dried_fruits are purchased from sources where they are neither sulphured nor sprayed.
   Apples come from a farm in Vermont where they are not sprayed.
   Oranges and grapefruit are shipped from Florida weekly from an organic farm.
     Finding sources for these high_quality foods is a problem.
   Sometimes the solution comes in unexpected ways.
   Following a talk by Mr._Clark at the New_York State_Natural_Food Associates Convention , a man from the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to the school from Vermont.
     Wheat-germ , brewer 's yeast and ground kelp are used in bread and in dishes such_as spaghetti_sauce , meat_loaves.
   Miss_Colman hopes to find suitable shakers so_that kelp can be available at the tables.
   Raw wheat-germ is available on the breakfast_table for the children to help themselves.
     Very_few fried foods are used and the use of salt and pepper is discouraged.
   Drinking with meals is also discouraged ; pitchers of water merely appear on the tables.
     Nothing is peeled.
   The source is known so there is no necessity to remove insecticide residues.
   The cooking conserves a maximum of the vitamin_C content of vegetables by methods which use very little water and cook in the shortest time possible.
     Since Mr._Clark believes firmly that the chewing of hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth , raw_vegetables and raw whole-wheat grains are handed_out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat cookies at snack time in the afternoons.
   To solve the problem of the wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot , a ball of maple_syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains.
     On their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains , the children carry whole grains to munch along the trail.
   They learn to like these so well that it is n't surprising to hear that one boy tried the oats he was feeding his horse at chore time.
   They tasted good to him , so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his cereal_bowl with milk and honey.
     Maple_syrup is made by the children in the woods on the school grounds.
   This and raw sugar replace ordinary refined_sugar on the tables and very little sugar is used in cooking.
   Candy is not allowed.
   Parents are asked in the bulletin to send packages of treats consisting_of fruit and nuts , but no candy.
     Mr._Clark believes_in a good full breakfast of fruit , hot_cereal , milk , honey , whole-wheat toast with real butter and eggs.
   The heavy meal comes in the middle of the day.
   Soup is often the important dish at supper.
   Homemade of meat , bones and vegetables , it is rich_in dissolved minerals and vitamins.
     The school finds that the children are satisfied with smaller amounts of food since all_of it is high in quality.
   The cost to feed one person is just under one dollar a day.
     Even before he saw the necessity of growing better food and planning good nutrition , Mr._Clark felt the school had a good_health program.
   Rugged outdoor exercise for an hour and a half every_day in_all kinds of weather was the rule.
   A vigorous program existed in skiing , skating sports and overnight hiking.
     Since the change to better nutrition , he feels he can report on improvements in health , though he considers the following statements observations and not scientific proof.
     Visitors to the school ask what shampoo they use on the children 's hair to bring_out the sheen.
   The ruddy complexion of the faces also brings comment.
    
    Buffeted by swirling winds , the little green biplane struggled northward between the mountains beyond Northfield_Gulf.
   Wires whined as a cold November blast rocked the silver wings , but the engine roar was reassuring to the pilot bundled in_the_open cockpit.
   He peered ahead and grinned as the railroad_tracks came into view again below.
      Good old iron compass !
 he thought.
     A plume of smoke rose from a Central_Vermont locomotive which idled behind a string of gravel cars , and little figures that were workmen labored to set the ruptured roadbed to rights.
   The girders of a shattered Dog_River bridge lay strewn for half a mile downstream.
   Vermont 's main railroad_line was prostrate.
   And in the dark days after the Great_Flood of 1927 - the worst natural disaster in the state 's history - the little plane was its sole replacement in carrying the United_States mails.
     Rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of Friday , November 4 , 1927 , when officials of the Post_Office_Department 's Railway_Mail_Service realized that their distribution system for Vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight.
   Clerks and postmasters shoveled muck out of their offices - those who still had offices - and wondered how to move the mail.
   The state 's railroad system counted miles of broken bridges and missing rights-of-way : it would obviously remain out of commission for weeks.
   And once medicine , food , clothing and shelter had been provided for the flood 's victims , communications and the mail were the next top problems.
     From Burlington , outgoing mail could be ferried across Lake_Champlain to the railroad at Port_Kent , N._Y..
   But what came_in was piling_up.
   The nearest undisrupted end of track from Boston was at Concord , N._H..
   When Governor_Al_Smith offered New_York National_Guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state , it seemed a likely temporary solution , easing Burlington 's bottleneck and that at Montpelier too.
     The question was  Where to land ?
   There was no such thing as an airport in Vermont.
   Burlington aviator John_J._Burns suggested the parade_ground southwest of Fort_Ethan_Allen , and soon a dozen hastily-summoned National_Guard pilots were bringing their wide-winged  Jenny  and DeHaviland two-seaters to rest on the frozen sod of the military base.
     The only available field that could be used near flood-ravaged Montpelier was on the Towne farm off upper Main_Street , a narrow hillside where takeoffs and landings could be safely made only under light wind conditions.
   Over in Barre the streets had been deep in swirling water , and bridges were crumpled and gone.
   Anticipating delivery of medicines and yeast by plane , Granite_City citizens formed an airfield committee and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172 nd Infantry , Vermont National_Guard , laid_out runways on Wilson flat , high on Millstone_Hill.
   The  Barre_Aviation_Field  was set_to receive its first aircraft the Sunday following the flood.
     Though the makeshift airports were ready , the York_State_Guard flyers proved unable to keep any kind_of mail schedule.
   They had courage but their meager training consisted_of weekend hops in good_weather , in and out of established airports , And the increasingly cold_weather soon raised hob with the water cooled engines of their World_War 1 , planes.
   It seemed like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering the post_office_department to contract for the transport of first_class mail by air.
   They had_to act fast , for letters were clogging the terminals.
     Down in Concord , New_Hampshire , was a flier in the right place at the right time : Robert_S._Fogg , a native New_Englander , had been a World_War 1 , flying instructor , barnstormer , and one of the original planners of the Concord_Airport.
   Tall , wiry , dark-haired Bob_Fogg had already racked_up one historical first in air_mail history.
   Piloting a Curtiss_Navy_MF flying_boat off Lake_Winnipesaukee in 1925 , he had inaugurated the original Rural Delivery air service in America.
     During the excitement following Lindbergh 's flight to Paris earlier in 1927 , dare devil aviators overnight became legendary heroes.
   In Concord , Bob_Fogg was the_most prominent New_Hampshire boy with wings.
   Public-spirited backers staked him to a brand-new airplane , aimed at putting their city and state on the flying map.
   The ship was a Waco biplane , one of the first two of its type to be fitted with the air cooled , 225 HP_Wright radial_engine known as the Whirlwind.
   A trim green and silver-painted craft only 22 - 1 2 feet long , the Waco was entered to compete in the  On-to-Spokane  Air_Derby of 1927.
   As_a_matter_of_fact , Fogg and his plane did n't get beyond Pennsylvania in the race - an engine oil leak forced him down - but the flying service and school he started subsequently were first_steps in paying_off his wry-faced backers.
   So with all this experience , Bob_Fogg was a natural choice to receive the first Emergency Air_Mail Star_Route contract.
   His work began just six days after the flood.
     By airline from Concord to Burlington is a distance of about 150 miles , counting a slight deviation for the stop at either Barre or Montpelier.
   The first few days Bob_Fogg set his plane down on Towne field back of the State_House when the wind was right , and used Wilson flat above Barre when it was n't.
   Between the unsafe Towne field and the long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to Wilson flat , arrangements at the state_capital were far from satisfactory.
   Each time in , the unhappy pilot , pushing his luck , begged the postal officials that met him to find a safer landing_place , preferably on the flat-topped hills across the Winooski_River.
      But Fogg  , they countered ,  we can n't get_over there.
   And besides you seem to make_it all_right here .
   It took a tragedy to bring things to a head.
   After a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind takeoffs , Fogg one_day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage of an Army plane strewn across snow-covered Towne field.
   Sent to Montpelier by Secretary_Herbert_Hoover , Red_Cross Aide_Reuben_Sleight had been killed , and his pilot , Lt._Franklin_Wolfe , badly injured.
   With the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply flown into the hillside.
     Faced with this situation , Postmaster_Charles_F._McKenna of Montpelier went with Fogg on a Burlington trip , and together they scouted the terrain on the heights of Berlin.
   A long flat known as the St._John field seemed to answer their purpose , and since the Winooski bridges were at_last passable , they decided to use it.
     With a wary eye on the farmer 's bull , Fred_Somers of Montpelier and Mr._St._John marked the field with a red table cloth.
   As a wind direction indicator , they tied a cotton rag to a sapling.
   With these aids , and a pair of skiis substituting for wheels on the Waco , Bob_Fogg made the first landing on what is now part of the Barre-Montpelier_Airport on November 21 , 1927.
     Each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail_pouches.
   During the second week of operations , Fogg received a telegram from the Post_Office_Department , asking him to  put_on two airplanes and make two flights daily , plus one Sunday trip .
   Since Fogg 's was a one-man , one-plane flying service , this meant that he would have to do both trips , flying alone 600 miles a day , under sub-freezing temperature conditions.
     Over the weeks , America 's first Star_Route Air_Mail settled into a routine pattern despite the vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation.
   Each morning at five Fogg crawled out_of_bed to bundle into flying togs over the furnace register of his home.
   Always troubled by poor circulation in his feet , he experimented with various combinations of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style felt farmer 's boots with his sheepskin flying boots pulled over them.
   A sheep-lined leather flying suit , plus helmet , goggles and mittens completed his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit.
   The airman 's stock answer to  Were n't you cold ?
 became  Yes , the first_half hour is tough , but by then I 'm so numb I do n't notice it !
     As daylight began to show through the frosty windows , Fogg would place a call to William_A._Shaw at the U._S. Weather_Station at Northfield , Vermont , for temperature and wind-velocity readings.
   Shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station.
    Ceilings  were judged by comparison with known mountain heights and cloud positions.
   Later_on in the day Fogg could get a better weather picture from the Burlington Weather_Bureau supervised by Frank_E._Hartwell.
     Out at the airport each morning , Fogg 's skilled mechanic Caleb_Marston would have the Waco warmed_up and running in the drafty hangar.
   ( He 'd get the engine oil flowing with an electric_heater under a big canvas cover.
 )   Wishing to show that aviation was dependable and here to stay , Bob_Fogg always made a point of taking_off each morning on the dot of seven , disregarding rain , snow and sleet in true postal tradition.
   Concord learned to set its clocks by the rackety bark of the Whirlwind 's exhaust overhead.
   Sometimes the pilot had_to turn_back if fully blocked by fog , but 85 % of his trips were completed.
     Plane radios were not_yet available , and once in_the_air , Fogg flew his ship by compass , a good memory for landmarks as seen from above , and a capacity for dead_reckoning and quick computation.
   Often , threading through the overcast , he was forced to fly close_to the ground by a low ceiling , skimming above the Winooski or the White_River along the line of the broken railroad.
   When driving rain or mist socked in one valley , Fogg would chandelle up and over to reverse course and try another one , ranging from the Ottauquechee up_to Danville in search of safe passage through the mountain_passes.
     The dependable Wright engine was never stopped on these trips.
   It ticked over smoothly , idling while Fogg exchanged mails with the armed messenger from Burlington at Fort_Ethan_Allen , and one from Montpelier and Barre at the St._John field.
     Sometimes , on a return trip , the aviator would  go upstairs  high over the clouds.
   There he 'd take a compass heading , figure his air speed , and deduce that in a certain number of minutes he 'd be over the broad meadows of the Merrimack_Valley where it would be safe to let_down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him.
   Bob_Fogg did n't have today 's advantages of Instrument_Flight and Ground_Control_Approach systems.
   At the end of the calculated time he 'd nose the Waco down through the cloud_bank and hope to break_through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable.
     Usually back in Concord by noon , there was just time to get partially thawed out , refuel , and grab a_bit of Mrs._Fogg 's hot broth before starting the second trip.
   Day_after_day Fogg shuttled back_and_forth on his one-man air_mail route , until the farmers in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country.
     The flyer had his share of near-misses.
   At Fort_Ethan_Allen the ever-present wind off Lake_Champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing like an airplane if the pilot miscalculated.
   Once the soldiers from the barracks had_to hold the ship from blowing away while Fogg revved the engine and got the tail up.
   At a nod of his head they let_go , turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream.
   Tracks in the snow showed the plane was airborne in less_than a_hundred feet.
     One afternoon during a cold , powdery snowstorm , Fogg took_off for Concord from the St._John field.
    
    Are you retiring now?
   If so , are you saying ,  Where did the last few years go?
   How did I get to be sixty-five so fast?
   What do I do now ?
     Yes , retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly.
   Somehow we old-timers never figured we would ever retire.
   We always thought we would die with our boots on.
   Out_of_the_blue comes talk of pension plans.
   Compulsory retirement at sixty-five looms on our horizon.
   Still , it seems in the far future.
   Suddenly , one_day , up it pops!
   Sixty-five years and you 've had_it!
     So , now what?
   Oh sure!
   You 've thought_about it before in a hazy sort_of way.
   But!
   It never seemed real ; never seemed as if it could happen to you ; only to the other fellow.
     Now!
   Here it is!
   How am I going_to live?
   What am I going_to do?
   Where do I go from here?
     A great many retired people are the so-called white collar workers.
   Are you one of these?
     If so , you are of the old_school.
   You are conscientious , hard working , honest , accurate , a good penman , and a stickler for a job well done , with no loose_ends.
   Everything must balance to the last penny.
   Also you can spell , without consulting a dictionary for every_other word.
   You never are late for work and seldom absent.
     Actually , you can take no special credit for this.
   It is the way you were taught and your way_of_life.
   All this is standard equipment for a man of your day ; your stock in trade ; your livelihood.
     However , the last few years of your life , things seem to be changing.
   Your way does n't seem to be so darned important any_more.
   You realize you are getting_in the old fogy class.
   To put it bluntly , you are getting out-moded.
     What 's happened?
   The answer is a new era.
     Now , looming on the horizon are such things as estimated totals , calculated risks and I._B._M. machines.
   The Planning_Dept. comes into existence.
   All sorts of plans come_to_life.
   This is followed by a boom in conferences.
   Yes sir!
   Conferences become very popular.
   When a plan burst its seams , hasty conferences supply the necessary patch , and life goes merrily on.
   That 's called progress!
   The new way_of_life!
   Let 's face it!
   You had your day and it was a good_day.
   Let this generation have theirs.
   Time marches_on!
     Well , to get_back to the problem of retirement.
   Every retiring person has a different situation facing him.
   Some have plenty of money - some have very little money.
   Some are blest with an abundance of good_health - some are in poor health and many are invalids.
   Some have lovely homes - some live in small apartments.
   Some have beautiful gardens - some not even a blade of grass.
   Some have serenity of mind , the ability to accept what they have , and make the most of it ( a wonderful gift to have , believe me ) - some see only darkness , the bitter side of everything.
   Well , whatever you have , that 's it!
   You 've got_to learn to live with_it.
     Now!
   The question is  How are you going_to live with_it ?
     You can sit_back and moan and bewail your lot.
   Yes!
   You can do this.
   But , if you do , your life will be just one thing - unhappiness - complete and unabridged.
     It seems to me , the first thing you 've got_to do , to be happy , is to face_up to your problems , no_matter what they may be.
   Make_up your mind to pool your resources and get the_most out of your remaining years of life.
   One thing , I am sure of , you must get an interest in life.
   You 've got_to do something.
     Many_of you will say ,  Well , what can I do ?
     Believe me!
   There are many , many things to do.
   Find_out what you like to do most and really give_it_a_whirl.
   If you can n't think_of a thing to do , try something - anything.
   Maybe you will surprise yourself.
     True!
   We are not all great artists.
   I , frankly , can n't draw a straight_line.
   Maybe you are not that gifted either , but how about puttering_around with the old paints?
   You may amaze yourself and acquire a real knack for it.
   Anyway , I 'll bet you have a_lot_of fun.
     Do you like to sew?
   Does making your own clothes or even doll clothes , interest you?
   Do you love to run_up a hem , sew on buttons , make neat buttonholes?
   If you do , go_to_it.
   There is always a market for this line_of_work.
   Some women can sit and sew , crochet , tat or knit by_the_hour , and look calm and relaxed and turn_out beautiful work.
   Where sewing is_concerned , I 'm a total loss.
   When you see a needle in my hands you will know the family buttons have fallen_off and I have_to sew them back on , or get_out the safety_pins.
     Then_again , there 's always that lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs.
   Not for me , but perhaps just the thing for you.
     Well!
   How 's about mosaic tile , ceramics or similar arts and crafts?
   Some people love to crack tile and it 's amazing what beautiful designs they come_up with as a result of their cracking good time.
     How about the art of cooking?
   Do you yearn to make cakes and pies , or special cookies and candies?
   There is always an open market for this sort_of delicacy , in_spite_of low calorie diets , cottage_cheese and hands-off-all-sweets to_the_contrary.
     Some people can carve most anything out of a_piece of wood.
   Some make beautiful chairs , cabinets , chests , doll houses , etc..
   Perhaps you could n't do that but have you ever tried to see what you could do with a hunk of wood?
   Outside of cutting your fingers , maybe you would come_up with nothing at_all , but then_again , you might turn_out some dandy little gadgets.
     Some women get a real thrill out of housework.
   They love to dust , scrub , polish , wax floors , move the furniture around from_place_to_place , take_down the curtains , put_up new ones and have themselves a real ball.
   Maybe that 's your forte.
   It certainly is n't mine.
   I can look at furniture in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure that 's where it belongs.
     Perhaps you would like to become a writer.
   This gives you a wide and varied choice.
   Will it be short_stories , fiction , nonfiction , biography , poetry , children 's stories , or even a book if you are really ambitious?
     Ever since I was a child , I have always had a yen to try my hand at writing.
   If you do decide to write , you will soon become acquainted_with rejection slips and dejection.
   Do n't be discouraged!
   This is just being a normal writer.
   Just let the rejection slips fall where they may , and keep_on plugging , and finally you will make the grade.
   Few new writers have their first story accepted , so they tell me.
   But , it could happen , and it may happen to you.
     Then there 's always hobbies , collecting stamps , coins , timetables , salt and pepper shakers , elephants , dogs , dolls , shells , or shall we just say collecting anything your heart desires?
     I can hear some of you folks protesting.
   You say ,  But it costs a_lot_of money to have a hobby.
   I have n't got that kind_of money .
     True!
   It does cost a_lot_of money for most hobbies but there are hobbies that are for_free.
   How about a rock collection , or a collection of leaves from different trees or shrubs and in different colors?
   Then , take flowers.
   They are many and varied.
   Also , there 's scrap books , collecting newspaper pictures and clippings , or any items of interest to you.
   It 's getting interested in something that counts.
     As for me , I am holding in reserve two huge puzzles ( I love puzzles ) to put_together when time hangs heavy on my hands.
   So_far , the covers have never been off the boxes.
   I just do n't have time to do half the things I want to do now.
     So in closing , fellow retired members , I advise you to make the most of each_day , enjoy each one to the n't h degree.
   Travel , if you can.
   Keep occupied to_the_point you are not bored with life and you will truly find these final days and years of your lives to be sunshine sweet.
     Good_Luck!
   To one and all - Good_Days ahead!
   An important criterion of maturity is creativity.
   The mature person is creative.
   What does_it mean to be creative , a term we hear with increasing frequency these days?
   When we turn_to Noah_Webster we find him helpful as_usual.
    To be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist - to produce where nothing was before - to bring_forth an original production of human intelligence or power .
   We are creative , it seems , when we produce something which has not previously existed.
   Thus creativity may run all_the_way from making a cake , building a chicken_coop , or producing a book , to founding a business , creating a League of Nations or , developing a mature character.
     All living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence the power of creativity , if it is only to reproduce a form like their own.
   While man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors in the evolutionary process , he is the only animal with a true non-instinctive and conscious creative ability.
   An animal , bird or insect creates either a burrow , or nest or hive in unending sameness according to specie.
   Man 's great superiority over these evolutionary forbears is in the development of his imagination.
   This gives him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories , ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and ever-changing forms.
     It has been truly said that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world.
   In our own time we have seen the_most fantastic imagery of a Jules_Verne come into actuality.
   The vision of a Lord_Tennyson expressed in a poem 100 years ago took visible form over London in_the_air blitzes of 1941.
   In_fact all_of our civilized world is the resultant of man 's projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more.
   It is in_this one aspect , at_least , that man seems to be made in the image of his Creator.
     Not_only can man project his imagination out into his environment in concrete forms , but even more importantly , he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself.
   We recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training can become athletes , acrobats , dancers , musicians and artists , developing many potentialities.
   We know that actors can learn to portray a wide variety of character roles.
   By this same combination of the will and the imagination , each one of us can learn to portray permanently the kind_of character we would like to be.
   We must realize with Prof._Charles_Morris in his The Open_Self that  Man is the being that can continually remake himself , the artisan that is himself the material for his own creation .
     So_far in history man has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment rather_than first creating the sort_of person who can make the highest use of the things he has created.
   Is not the present world crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall the tragedy.
   Is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend our weight to being creative on the character side and to hasten our own maturing process?
     Sir_Julian_Huxley in his book Uniqueness Of Man makes the novel point that just_as man is unique in being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood under family protection , so is he the only animal who has a long period after the decline of his procreativity.
    
    Some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples are a thing of the remote , Victorian past ; that nowadays all honeymooners are thoroughly familiar_with the best sex-manuals and know enough from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all the anxiety and hazards out of the situation.
     Perhaps - but extensive discussions with contemporary practitioners , family_doctors and gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance.
   Joking and talking may be freer and easier , but the important factual information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men and women.
     Various factors in the setting can still be of great advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather_than a bad memory for one or both.
   Privacy must be highly assured both in_time and place.
   That_is , locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of location , but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough for an utterly unhurried fulfillment.
     If the wedding_party lasted late , and the travel schedule means there are only a_few hours before resuming the trip or making an early start , the husband may forestall tensions and uncertainties by confiding to his bride that lying in each other 's arms will be bliss enough for these few hours.
   The consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long private time ( day or night ) for that purpose.
     First intercourse for the bride brings with it the various problems connected with virginity and the hymen.
     One thing should be clear to both husband and wife - neither pain nor profuse bleeding has_to occur when the hymen is ruptured during the first sex_act.
   Ignorance on this point has caused a great_deal of needless anxiety , misunderstanding and suspicion.
     The hymen is , in_essence , a fragile membrane that more_or_less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most female human_beings who have not had sex relations.
   ( Hymen , in_fact , is the Greek word for membrane.
 )     Often it is thin and fragile and gives_way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse.
   As_might_be_expected , girls in_this situation bleed very little and perhaps not_at_all in the process of losing their virginity.
     It is also important to realize that many girls are_born without a hymen or at_most only a tiny trace of one ; so_that the absence of the hymen is by_no_means positive proof that a girl has had sex relations.
     But there is a basis in_fact for the exaggerations of the folk-lore beliefs.
   Some hymens are so strongly developed that they cannot be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked loss of blood.
   More rarely , the hymen is so sturdy that it does not yield to penetration.
     Extreme cases are on record in_which the doctor has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital relations_to be consummated.
   These cases , for all their rarity , are so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen is a serious problem to newly-weds.
     In_recent_times , when sexual matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly , the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention.
   Obviously , the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new situation.
   Is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride?
     Gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride should consult a physician before marriage.
   If he foresaw any problem because of the quality of the hymen , it was recommended that simple procedures be undertaken at_once to incise the hymen or , preferably , to dilate it.
     As a natural outgrowth of_this approach it was often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for painless intercourse by dilating the vagina.
     This recommendation was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth consummation of the sex_act.
   The vagina is an organ capable_of remarkable contraction and dilation.
   This is obvious when it is remembered that , during childbirth , the vagina must dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby.
     The intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control.
   But an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious intention of the woman.
   That_is , when first penetration takes_place , the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent further pain.
     The advantages of dilatation by the physician are both physical and psychological.
   Since it is a purely professional situation , none of the pain is associated with love-making or the beloved.
   By using instruments of gradually increasing size , the vagina is gently , and with minimum pain at each stage , taught to yield to an object of the appropriate shape.
     In_this process the vaginal muscles come under better conscious control by the girl.
   She learns how to relax them to accept - instead of contracting them to repel the entering object.
     Apart from the standard problem of controlling the vaginal muscles , other serious barriers may exist that need special gynecological treatment.
   It is far better to have such conditions treated in_advance than to have them show_up on the honeymoon where they can create a really serious situation.
     When no medical problems exist , the newly married_couple generally prefer to cope_with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves.
   Special information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still of great value.
   Folk-lore , superstition and remembered passages from erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly taken as scientific facts and useful hints.
     The importance of loving tenderness is obvious.
   The long , unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels.
   Under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases , providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration.
     Extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall ( the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back ) may cause a great_deal of distress in a virgin.
   But during the same examination , two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall ( the bottom of the vagina in the same position ) without any pain ; and in_fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at_all_times.
     These regional differences of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse.
   The husband and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in mind.
   They may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too_much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina ; at_least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no_longer a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making.
     In_fact , the technical procedure in medical_examinations may be wisely adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon.
     Locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration.
   The false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling the problem once_and_for_all.
     Such talk is seriously in error.
   Ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride , both physically and psychologically.
   The insistent , forceful penetration may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as_well as do excessive damage to the hymen.
     The pain and distress associated with the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital relations and cause her , unconsciously , to make the sex_act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it.
     Serious attention must also be given to the husband 's problems in the honeymoon situation.
   The necessity for keeping alert to his bride 's hazards can act_as an interference with the man 's spontaneous desire.
   The emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience a premature climax.
   This is a very common experience and should in_no_way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife.
     Or the frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period.
   The signals to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to take_advantage IN them.
     The best course is to recover his physical excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again.
   This may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding and self-centered.
   He can take security from the fact that the progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost.
     Now while he uses talk , caresses or requires caresses from her , his bride will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they both so eagerly desire.
     A final word.
   The accumulated information on this point shows that first intercourse , even when it is achieved with minimum pain or difficulty , is seldom an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman.
   Too many new things are happening for it to be a complete erotic fulfillment.
     Only under rare circumstances would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse.
   Both man_and_wife should be aware_of the fact that a lack of climax , and even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that the wife may be cold or frigid.
     If the early approaches are wise , understanding and patient , the satisfactions of marital fulfillment will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older.
     Writing in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures , titled The Nude : A Study in Ideal Form , Kenneth_Clark declares :  he human_body , as a nucleus , is rich_in associations.
   It is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things we wish to do with ourselves .
     Perhaps this is a clue to the amazing variety and power of reactions , attitudes , and emotions precipitated by the nude form.
     The wide divergence of reactions is clearly illustrated in the Kinsey studies in human sexuality.
   Differences were_related to social , economic , and educational backgrounds.
   Whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt to avoid or be shocked by nudity , those educated beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual_relations.
     Such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that her husband had  never seen her entirely naked  , while another woman , boasting an equal number of years of married life , is proud of having  shared the nudist way_of_life - the really free , natural nude life - for most_of that period .
     Attempts at censorship always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions.
   The indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude human form as  lewd and pornographic , a threat and danger  to all the young , or good , or religious , or moral persons.
     The equally ardent proponent of freedom from any kind_of censorship may find the nude human form the  natural , honest , free expression of man 's spirit and the epitome of beauty and inspiration .
     One is always a_little surprised to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected.
   I still recall the mild shock I experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic advocate of the  clean , healthful , free way of natural life in nudism  , who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution in fine spirit.
    
    She gave herself a title - Lady_Diana_Harrington.
     The New_York D._A. gave her another-the Golden_Girl of cafe society.
     Houston police gave her a third , less flamboyant , title - prostitute.
     And Houston police have the final say in the_matter since she died there on September 20 , 1960 ,  Diane_Harris_Graham , 30 , D._O._A. circumstances - unusual .
     Early in her life she had discovered that where there were men , there was money , and with the two came luxury and liquor.
   She was still in the play for pay business when she died , a top trollop who had given the world 's oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour.
     She never hid the fact that she liked to play.
   Her neighbors in the expensive Houston apartment_building told reporters that the ash-blonde beauty had talked at_times about her past as  the Golden_Girl of the Mickey_Jelke trial .
     It was the trial of oleomargarine heir Minot ( Mickey ) Jelke for compulsory prostitution in New_York that put the spotlight on the international play-girl.
   ( Jelke later served 21 months when he was found guilty of masterminding a ring of high-priced call_girls.
 )     Diane was needed as a material witness in the case and New_York police searched three continents before they found her in their own back yard - in a swank hotel , of_course.
   She had been moving in cafe society as Lady_Diana_Harrington , a name that made some of the gossip columns.
     It was when she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation she liked best.
     Clad in mink and diamonds , she listened to Assistant District_Attorney Anthony_Liebler describe her to the arraigning judge :      This girl is the Golden_Girl of cafe society.
      In 1951 she was a prostitute in New_York County.
   In the spring and early summer of_that year she met a wealthy foreign tycoon who took her to France , where she later met a very wealthy_man and toured all Europe with him.
      At Deauville she met an Egyptian by the name of Pulley_Bey.
   He was the official procurer for King_Farouk , now in exile.
   She was in Egypt during the revolution and had passport difficulty.
   She lied in order to get it.
      We have checked her in different parts of Europe and Egypt and finally back into this country.
   She has been acting_as a prostitute.
      Our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts to Jelke .
     Diane sobbingly denied this to the court.
      That 's a lie.
   I never gave that boy a cent.
   I am not a prostitute , and I had only one very wealthy boy friend  , she said.
     During the course of the trial , Jelke backed_up part of_that statement.
      Diane is the type of girl  , Jelke said ,  who would n't get loving - even on her wedding night - unless you piled_up all your money in_the_middle of the floor .
     But she seemed to have underestimated the number of her  boy friends .
     She came to New_York from Detroit as a teenager , but with a  sponsor  instead of a chaperone.
   As she told it ,  He 's a rich boy friend , an old guy about 60 .
   She was Mary_Lou_Brew then , wide-eyed , but not naive.
   She had talked her  boy friend  into sending her to New_York to take a screen_test.
     The screen_test was never made - but Diane was.
   She quickly moved into cafe society , possibly easing her conscience by talking constantly of her desire to be in show_business.
     She seemed so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail circuit set_up a practical_joke.
     An ex-fighter was introduced to her in a bar as  Mr._Warfield , the famous producer .
   The phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows.
      I 'd love to audition for you  , she gushed.
     The audition was held a_few minutes later in somebody 's apartment.
   She thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show the eminent producer how well she could dance.
     After a_few minutes he said ,  I can n't use you if you dance like that.
   I 'd like to see you dance nude .
     She hastily complied.
   Diane loved to dance in the nude , something she was to demonstrate time_and_again.
     She developed another quaint habit.
   Even among the fast set in which she was moving , her method for keeping an escort from departing too early was unique.
     When the date would try to bid her good-night at the door , she would tell him ,  If you go_home now , I 'll scream .
   More_often_than_not he would bow to the inevitable.
     One who needed no such threats was a French financier.
   One of the blonde 's yearnings that he satisfied was for travel.
   She wanted to go around the world , but she settled for a French holiday.
     In an anonymous interview with a French newspaper the financier told of spending several months with her.
    Then she went to Deauville where she met a member of a powerful Greek syndicate of gamblers .
     The Greek evidently fell_for her ,  Monsieur X  recounted , and to clinch what he thought was an affair in the making he gave her 100000 francs ( about $ 300 ) and led her to the roulette tables.
     She could do no wrong at the tables that time.
   And in_short_order the croupier had pushed several million francs her way.
   Smarter than most gamblers , she slipped_away from the casino , packed her bag and took the night train to Paris.
   No one ever learned what happened to the Greek.
     The luxury of Paris ' most fashionable hotel , the George 5 , , bored the beautifully-built blonde , so she high-tailed it to Rome.
     She teamed_up with another beauty , whose name has been lost to history , and commenced with some fiddling that would have made Nero envious.
     To climax her Roman revels , she was thrown_out of the swanky Hotel_Excelsior after she had run naked through its marble halls screaming for help.
     It was a rugged finish for what must have been a very interesting night.
     Discreet Italian police described it in a manner typically continental.
      There had been a threesome at the party in the suite 's bedroom : Miss_Harrington ( this was Diane 's choice for a Roman name ) , another woman who has figured in other very interesting events and one of your well-known American actors.
      The actor had had much to drink and apparently became very violent.
   The hotel staff , as_well as residents of the Excelsior , told us they saw that both ladies were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing down the hall.
      They were wearing nothing but their scratches.
   They were asked to leave the hotel.
   No charges were filed .
     The girls , after dressing , were indignant.
      You can n't do this to us  , Diane screamed.
    We are Americans .
     In the morning she found rooms directly across from the Excelsior at the equally luxurious Hotel_Ambassador.
     With the Ambassador as headquarters , she continued to promote good_will abroad.
   Of_course , her benevolence was limited to those who could afford it , but then there is a limit to what one person can do.
     By this time Diane was a beguiling lass of 19 and still seeking her place in the world.
   She thought royal status might come her way when , while she was still in Rome , she met Pulley_Bey , a personal procurer to King_Farouk of Egypt.
     A close friend of hers in the Roman days described it this way :      It was a strange relationship.
   Pulley_Bey spoke no English.
   Diane spoke no Italian or French.
   She had a hard_time making him understand that it was Farouk she wished to meet.
      Pulley_Bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him  , the friend continued.
   It seemed as though she were always auditioning.
     No believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors , the plump Pulley broke the language_barrier and lured her to Cairo where she waited for nine months , vainly hoping to see Farouk.
     Pulley had set her up at the Semiramis_Hotel , but she grew impatient waiting for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to_which the royal pimp had no key.
     She picked her own Middle-Eastern friends from the flock of ardent Egyptians that buzzed around her.
   Tewfik_Badrawi , Mohammed_Gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of Cairo society enjoyed her company.
      So extensive became her circle of admirers  , Egyptian police said ,  that her escapades caused distrust .
     The roof was about ready to fall_in on Diane 's little world , but it took nothing less_than the Egyptian revolution to bring it down.
   When Farouk was overthrown , police picked_up his personal pimp , Pulley_Bey.
   They also called_upon Diane with a request for a look at her passport.
     The cagey Pulley_Bey , who spoke no English , had taken the passport so_that Diane could n't leave the country without his approval.
   Officials provided a temporary passport , good only for return to the United_States.
     And return to the United_States she did , into waiting arms - the unromantic ones of the New_York District_Attorney 's office.
     Held as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of Mickey_Jelke , the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed to the Women 's House of Detention , a terribly overcrowded prison.
     It is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk the District_Attorney into having her removed from the prison to a hotel_room , with her meals taken at Vesuvio 's , an excellent Italian restaurant.
     Newspapers at_the_time noted that the move indicated that she was co-operating with the District_Attorney.
     With the end of the trial Diane disappeared from New_York.
   It was no_longer fashionable to be seen with fabulous  Lady_Harrington .
     Several years ago she married a Houston business man , Robert_Graham.
   She later divorced Graham , who is believed to have moved to Bolivia.
     Houston police got to know Diane two years ago when the vice_squad picked her up for questioning about a call_girl ring.
   Last May , they said , she admitted being a prostitute.
     The next time the police saw her she was dead.
     It was September 20 , 1960 , in a lavishly decorated apartment littered with liquor bottles.
   She had had a party with a regular visitor , Dr._William_W._McClellan.
     McClellan , who had once lost his medical license temporarily on a charge of drug_addiction , was with her when she died.
   He had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had happened during that time.
   When he realized she was dead , he called two lawyers and_then the police.
     When the police arrived , they found McClellan and the two lawyers sitting and staring silently.
     The blonde 's nude body was in_bed , a green sheet and a pink blanket covered her.
   Pictures of her in more glamorous days were on the walls.
     An autopsy disclosed a large amount of morphine in Diane 's body.
   Police theorize that a combination of dope , drink and drugs killed her.
      I think that maybe she wanted it this way  , a vice_squad cop said.
    A maid told us that she still bragged about getting $ 50 a date.
   She was on the junk , and they slide fast when that happens.
   At_least she never knew what the bottom was like .
   I am a carpet salesman.
     I work for one of the biggest chains of retail carpet houses in the East.
   We cater mostly to nice people in the $ 5 - 8000 annual income_bracket and we run a string of snazzy , neon-lit , chromium-plated suburban stores.
     I am selling the stuff of_which is made one of the Great American_Dreams - wall-to-wall carpeting.
     There is only one trouble with this big , beautiful dream.
   From_where I sit it looks more like a nightmare.
     People come to me with_confidence.
   They depend_on my supposedly expert knowledge of a trade of_which they themselves know little.
     But I knowingly abuse their confidence.
    
    Ten-year-old_Richard_Stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome for almost a year.
   His grades had gone steadily downhill , and he had stopped bringing friends and classmates home from school.
     Mr. and Mrs._Stewart were puzzled and concerned.
   Then one_day Dick 's classmate Jimmy , from next_door , let_the_cat_out_of_the_bag.
   The youngsters in the boys ' class had nicknamed Dick  Bugs_Bunny  because his teeth protruded.
     When Richard 's parents told him they wanted to take him to an orthodontist - a dentist who specializes in realigning teeth and jaws - their young son was interested.
   During the year that followed , Dick co-operated whole-heartedly with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved - an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his facial appearance.
     Richard_Stewart is no special case.
    The majority of children in the United_States could benefit by some form of orthodontic treatment  , says Dr._Allan_G._Brodie , professor and head of the department of orthodontics at the University of Illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field.
     What do parents need_to know about those  years of the braces  in_order not to waste a child 's time and their money?
   How can they tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment?
   Why and when should tooth-straightening be undertaken?
   What is it likely to cost?
     Occlusion is the dentist 's expression for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed.
   Malocclusion , or a bad fit , is what parents need_to look_out for.
   One main type of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper front_teeth.
   A chin too prominent in_relation_to the rest of the face , a thrusting forward of the lower front_teeth , an overdeveloped lower jawbone , and an underdeveloped upper_jaw indicate the opposite type of malocclusion.
     These two basic malformations have , of_course , many variations.
   A child probably requires some form of treatment if he has any of the following conditions :     A noticeable protrusion of the upper or lower_jaw.
     Crooked , overlapping , twisted , or widely_spaced teeth.
     Front_teeth not meeting when the back_teeth close.
     Upper teeth completely covering the lowers when the back_teeth close.
     The eyeteeth ( third from the middle on top , counting each front_tooth as the first ) beginning to protrude like fangs.
     Second teeth that have come_in before the first ones have fallen out , making a double row.
     Contrary to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago , when all malocclusion was blamed on some unfortunate habit , recent studies show that most tooth irregularity has at_least its beginning in hereditary predisposition.
   However , this does not mean that a child 's teeth or jaws must necessarily resemble those of someone in his family.
     Tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb - or finger-sucking , tongue-thrusting , or lip-sucking - but it 's important to remember that there 's a difference between normal and excessive sucking habits.
   It 's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs , and no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old.
   Occasional sucking up to the fifth year may_not affect a youngster 's teeth ; but after_that , if thumb-sucking pressure is frequent , it will have an effect.
     Malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost too_soon or retained too long.
   If a child loses a molar at the age of two , the adjoining teeth may shift toward the empty space , thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent ones and producing a jumble.
   If baby teeth are retained too long , the incoming second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal time or may have_to erupt in the wrong place.
     Every orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by their malformed teeth.
   Some such youngsters rarely smile , or they try to speak with the mouth closed.
   In certain cases , as in Dick_Stewart 's , a child 's personality is affected.
   Yet from the dentist 's point_of_view , bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons.
     Bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through a breakdown of the bony structure that supports their roots.
   This serious condition , popularly known as pyorrhea , is one of the chief causes of tooth loss in adults.
     Then , too , misplaced or jammed-together teeth are prone to trapping food particles , increasing the likelihood of rapid decay.
    For these and other reasons  , says Dr._Brodie ,  orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth .
     The failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal chewing , so_that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden on his digestive_system.
   Because of these chewing troubles , a child may avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition.
   Badly placed teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping.
      Most orthodontic work is done on children between the ages of 10 and 14 , though there have been patients as young as two and as old as 55  , says Dr._Brodie.
     In the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed , yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively easy.
   Orthodontic work is possible because teeth are held firmly but not rigidly , by a system of peridontal membrane with an involved nerve network , to the bone in the jaw ; they are not anchored directly to the bone.
   Abnormal pressure , applied over a period_of_time , produces a change in the bony deposit , so a tooth functions normally in the new position into which it has been guided.
     What can 10 - year-old Susan expect when she enters the orthodontist 's office?
   On her first visit the orthodontist will take X-rays , photographs , tooth measurements , and  tooth prints  - an impression of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and jaws.
     If he decides to proceed , he will custom-make for Susie an appliance consisting_of bands , plastic plates , fine wires , and tiny springs.
   This appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure on the bone.
   As the tooth moves , bone_cells on the pressure side of_it will dissolve , and new ones will form on_the_side from which the tooth has moved.
   This must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue grows , and no faster.
      If teeth are moved too rapidly , serious injury can be done to their roots as_well as to the surrounding bone holding them in_place  , explains Dr._Brodie.
    Moving one or two teeth can affect the whole system , and an ill-conceived plan of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child 's face .
     During the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately following each adjustment , Susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness , but after a short_time this will disappear.
   Parents are often concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay.
   When in_place , a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth that is covered.
     Next Susie will enter the treatment stage and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month , depending_on the severity of her condition.
   During these visits the dentist will adjust the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth.
     Last comes the retention stage.
   Susie 's teeth have now been guided into a desirable new position.
   But because teeth sometimes may drift back to their original position , a retaining appliance is used to lock them in_place.
   Usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and stretching across the teeth.
   Susie may wear this only at night or for a_few hours during the day.
     Then comes the time when the last wire is removed and Susie walks out a healthier and more attractive girl than when she first went to the orthodontist.
     How long will this take?
   Straightening one tooth that has come_in wrong may take only a_few months.
   Aligning all the teeth may take a year or more.
   An added complication such_as a malformed jaw may take two or three years to correct.
     The charge for a complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country.
   Work that might cost $ 500 to $ 750 in the South could cost $ 750 to $ 1200 in New_York_City or Chicago.
   An average national figure for two to three years of treatment would be $ 650 to $ 1000.
      Factors in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill and education of the practitioner  , says Dr._Brodie.
     To become an orthodontist , a man must first be licensed by his state as a dentist , then he must spend at_least two years in additional training to acquire a license as a specialist.
      Costs may seem high , but they used_to be even higher  , says Dr._Brodie.
    Fees are about half to a third of_what they were 25 years ago .
     The reason?
   People today are aware_of the value of orthodontics , and as a result there are more practitioners in the field.
     Most orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic materials and construction of the appliances , but usually the remainder of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years.
   In many cities in the United_States clinics associated with dental_schools will take patients at a nominal fee.
   Some municipal agencies will pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents.
     Growth studies have been carried_on consistently by orthodontists.
   Dr._Brodie has 30 - year records of head growth , started 20 minutes after children 's births.
      In_the_past anyone who said that 90 % of all malocclusion is hereditary was scoffed at ; now we know that family characteristics do affect tooth formation to a large extent  , he says.
    Fortunately through our growth studies we have been able to see what nature does , and that helps us know what we can do .
     This knowledge both modifies and dictates diagnosis and treatment.
   For_example , a boy may inherit a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another.
   In_the_past an orthodontist might have tried , over four or five years , to straighten and fit the boy 's large teeth into a jaw that , despite some growth , would never accommodate them.
   Now a dentist can recommend extraction immediately.
     In other cases , in_view of present-day knowledge of head growth , orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five years before treatment.
   The child is kept on call , and the orthodontist watches the growth.
    Nature often takes care IN the problem  , says Dr._Brodie.
    A child with a certain type of head and teeth will outgrow tooth deformity .
     That is why Dr._Brodie asks parents not to insist , against their dentist 's advice , that their child have orthodontic work done too early.
    Both because of our culture 's stress on beauty and our improved economic_conditions , some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it is wise_to do so.
   Let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start treatment  , he urges.
     Superior new material for orthodontic work is another result of research.
   Plastics are easier to handle than the vulcanized rubber formerly used , and they save time and money.
   Plaster_of_Paris , once utilized in making impressions of teeth , has been replaced by alginates ( gelatin-like material ) that work quickly and accurately and with least discomfort to a child.
     As a rule , the earlier general dental treatment is started , the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be.
      After your child 's baby teeth are all_in - usually at the age of two and one half to three - it 's time for that first dental appointment  , Dr._Brodie advises.
    Then see that your youngster has a routine checkup once a year .
     To help prevent orthodontic problems from arising , your dentist can do these things :     He can correct decay , thus preventing early loss of teeth.
   If a child does lose his first teeth prematurely because of decay - and if no preventive steps are taken - the other teeth may shift out of position , become overcrowded and malformed.
   In_turn the other teeth are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them.
    
    From_time_to_time the medium mentions other people  around him  , who were  on the other side  , and reports what they are saying.
   After a while there come initials and names , and he is interested to hear some rather unusual family nicknames.
   As the hour progresses , the sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific statements.
   There are a_few prognoses of coming events.
     Another medium , another sitter , would produce a somewhat different content , but in_general it would probably sound much like the foregoing reading.
   Some mediums speak in practical , down-to-earth terms , while others may stress the spiritual.
   Not all , as_a_matter_of_fact , consider themselves  mediums  in the sense of receiving messages from the deceased.
   In_fact , some sensitives rule this out , preferring to consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception ( ESP ) , on this side of the  veil .
   However that may be , people are known to go_to mediums for diverse reasons.
   Perhaps they are mourning a recent death and want comfort , to feel in touch with the deceased , or seek indications for future plans.
   They may , of_course , be curiosity seekers - or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship.
     The mediums with whom the Parapsychology_Foundation is working in_this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated state , so_that the sitter can make comments , ask and answer questions , instead of talking with a  control  who speaks through an entranced sensitive.
   What we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary conversation.
     But it is not really only a conversation.
   Many_a sitter ( in a personal sitting ) has been amazed to realize that the medium was describing very vividly his state_of_mind.
   He himself might_not have been really aware_of his own mood ; it had been latent , unspecified , semi-conscious and only partly realized - until she described it to him!
   Most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability to put_a_finger_on  pre-conscious  moods and to clarify them.
     However , in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium , he did not receive a personal reading.
   Instead he brought with him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium knew nothing.
   For this was to be a  proxy sitting .
     As was noted earlier , it is important that in valid , objective study of_this sort_of communication , the interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive.
   Dr._Karlis_Osis , Director_of_Research at the Parapsychology_Foundation , described the basis for the experiment in a Tomorrow article , (  New_Research on Survival After Death  , Spring 1958 ).
   He remarked :  It has been clearly established that in a_number_of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter .
     The possibility has_to be ruled_out that the medium 's ESP may tap the memory of the sitter , and to do this , the two central characters in_this drama must be separated.
     One way to do this is by  proxy sittings  , wherein the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute , the proxy sitter.
   If the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter except his name ( given by the experimenter ) , he cannot possibly give any clues , conscious or unconscious , far less ask leading questions.
   All he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner , seeking to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal impressions.
     Sometimes in these experiments  appointment sittings  are used.
   Here the absent sitter makes a  date  with a communicator ( someone close_to him who is deceased ) , asking him to  come_in  at a certain hour , when a channel will be open for him.
   In_this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator , nothing else.
   He gives this to the medium at the appointed time , and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages from the communicator.
   As always , a tape_recording or detailed notes are made , and a typescript of_this is sent to the absent sitter.
     So this proxy situation has set_up at_least a partial barrier between the medium 's ESP and the absent sitter 's mind.
   It is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements - though research still does not know how far afield ESP can range.
     Now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statements are meaningful to him.
   Here again laboratory approaches are being evolved , for it is recognized how  elastic  these readings can be , how they can apply to many people , and are often stated in_general terms all_too easily applied to any individual 's own case.
   If you look_at a reading meant for someone else , you will probably see that many_of the items could be considered as applicable to you , even when you were not in the picture at_all!
   An interested sitter may think the sensitive has made a  hit  , describing something accurately for him , but can he really be sure that another sitter , hearing the same statement , would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances?
   It is , of_course , easy to see how  J  will mean Uncle_Jack to one person and little Jane to another.
    A journey  ,  a_little white_house  ,  a change of outlook  , can apply to many people.
   And even more complex items can be interpreted to conform_to one 's own point_of_view , which is by nature so personal.
   One sitter may think  a leather couch  identifies a reading as surely directed to him ; to another , it seems that nobody but his father ever used the phrase ,  Atta boy !
     To get_around this quite difficult corner , there is one first_aid to objectiveness : prevent the distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him.
   If he is not told which of four or five readings was meant for him , he can more readily assess each item in a larger frame :  Does that statement really sound as if it were for me , significant in my particular life?
   Or am I taking something that could really apply to almost anybody , and forgetting that many other people probably have had a similar experience ?
     Conversely , experimenters would consider as impressive such statements as the following , which , if they turned_out to be hits , are so unusual as to be really significant :      He had four children , two sets of twins.
   After being a lawyer for twenty-five years he started studying for the ministry.
   Part of his house had been moved to the other side of the road.
   He died of typhoid in 1921 .
     Methods have been developed of assigning  weights  to statements ; that_is , it is known empirically that names beginning with R are more common than those beginning with Z ; that fewer women are named Miranda than Elizabeth ; that in the United_States more people die of heart_disease than of smallpox.
   So each reading can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding_up these weights.
   Specific dates would be important , as would double names.
   Various categories have been explored to find_out about these  empirical probabilities  against which to measure the readings.
     In The Parapsychology_Foundation 's long-range experiment , readings are made by a variety of sensitives for a large_number of cooperating sitters , trying to throw light on this question of the significance of mediumistic statements.
   It is very important indeed , in the field of extra-sensory perception and its relation_to the survival hypothesis , to know whether the statements are actually only those which any intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself.
   Or , on_the_other_hand , are unlikely facts being stated , facts which are in themselves significant and not easily applicable to everybody?
   That is one thing the experiments are designed to find_out.
     So , after the sitting has been held , several readings at_one_time are mailed , and the distant sitter ( whose name or whose communicator 's name was given to the medium ) must mark each little item as Correct ( Hit ) , Incorrect ( Miss ) , Doubtful , or Especially Significant ( applying to him and , he feels , not to anyone else ).
   He is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his.
   All these evaluations are then totted_up and tabulated , by adding_up the Hits and Significants , with the weight placed on those in the sitter 's own reading.
   That_is , if he marks as most correct a reading not meant for him , the total experimental score falls.
     Conversely , if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading , and finds more accurate facts in it than in the others , a point is chalked_up for the intrinsic , objective meaningfulness of_this type of mediumistic material.
   And there are some positive results , though the final findings will not be known for a long_time - and_then further research can be formulated.
     In another approach to the same procedure , the content of the readings is analyzed so_as_to see how the particular medium is likely to slant her statements.
   Does she often speak of locations , of cause of death?
   Does she accurately give dates , ages , kind_of occupation?
   It is possible to find_out in_which categories most_of her correct statements fall , and where she makes most_of her  hits .
   Now when , so_to_speak , the cream has been skimmed_off , and the items in the successful categories separated_out , the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated  cream  , where the sensitive is at her best.
     Mediumistic impressions are evidently of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses.
    I feel cold  , the medium says , or  My leg aches  ,  My head is heavy .
   Or perhaps she hears words or sounds :  There 's such a noise of loud machinery  , or  I hear a child crying  , or  He says we 're all here and glad to see you .
   Maybe an entire scene comes into consciousness , with action and motion , or a static view :  a house under a pine_tree , with a_little stone path going up to the door .
   The sensitive often seems to smell definite odors , too , or subjectively feels emotions.
   Sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery and seems to see all details in perspective , as if the scene were actually there.
   If pressed by the sitter for more detail , she may be able to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply , almost as if she were physically going closer.
     If asked how she gets her impressions , she probably can only say that she  just gets them  - some more vividly than others.
   Perhaps this is not so extraordinary after_all.
   Even in normal experience one gets impressions without knowing exactly how - of atmosphere , of one another 's personalities , moods , intentions.
     Of_course , there is an element of training here :   these gifted people , by concentration , study , guidance , have learned to develop their power.
   Simply using it increases its intensity , I was told by one sensitive.
     Nor does a medium automatically know how to interpret her imagery.
   Impressions often appear in a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face_value.
   It is apparently by symbols that the unconscious speaks_to the conscious , and the medium has_to translate these into meaning.
   If communication with an entity on the  other side  is taking_place , this too may assume the form of clairvoyant symbolism.
     During one reading an image appeared of a prisoner in irons.
   But this did not necessarily refer to an actual jail ; taken with other details it could have referred to a state of mental or spiritual confinement.
   In_this connection it is worth noting how names are sometimes obtained.
   Though they are often heard clairaudiently , as if a voice were speaking them , in other cases they are apprehended visually as symbols : a slope to signify the name  Hill  , for_instance.
   One medium saw two sheets flapping on a line and found that the name Shietz was significant to the sitter.
    
    In_the_past , the duties of the state , as Sir_Henry_Maine noted long_ago , were only two in number : internal order and external security.
   By prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men , the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial borders.
   Outside those limits it asserted , as against other states , a position of sovereign equality , and , as against the  inferior  peoples of the non-Western world , a position of dominance.
   It became the sole  subject  of  international_law  ( a term which , it is pertinent to remember , was coined by Bentham ) , a body of legal_principle which by_and_large was made_up of what Western nations could do in the world arena.
   ( That corpus of law was a reflection of the power_system in existence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
   Speaking generally , it furthered - and still tends to further - the interests of the Western powers.
   The enormous changes in world politics have , however , thrown it into confusion , so_much so_that it is safe to say that all international_law is now in need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions of the present era.
 )     Beyond the two basic tasks mentioned above , no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state responsibility , either internally or externally.
   This was particularly true in the world arena , which was an anarchical battleground characterized by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires.
   That any sort_of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have astonished a nineteenth-century statesman.
   His duty was to his sovereign and to his nation , and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial boundaries was not to be contemplated.
   Thus , to cite but one example , the Pax_Britannica of the nineteenth century , whether with the_British navy ruling the seas or with the City of London ruling world finance , was strictly national in motivation , however much other nations ( e._g. , the United_States ) may have incidentally benefited.
   At_the_same_time , all suggestions that some sort_of societal responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial state was strongly resisted.
   Social_Darwinism was able to stave_off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century.
     However , in recent decades , for what doubtless are multiple reasons , an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has occurred in both facets of national activity.
   A concept of responsibility is in process of articulation and establishment.
   Already firmly implanted internally , it is a growing factor in external matters.
     A_little more_than twenty years ago the American people turned an important corner.
   In_what has aptly been called a  constitutional revolution  , the basic nature of government was transformed from one essentially negative in nature ( the  night-watchman state  ) to one with affirmative duties to perform.
   The  positive state  came into existence.
   For lawyers , reflecting perhaps their parochial preferences , there has been a special fascination since then in the role played by the Supreme_Court in_that transformation - the manner in_which its decisions altered in  the switch in_time that saved nine  , President_Roosevelt 's ill-starred but in_effect victorious  Court-packing plan  , the imprimatur of judicial approval that was finally placed upon social legislation.
   Of greater importance , however , is the content of those programs , which have had and are having enormous consequences for the American people.
   Labor relations have been transformed , income security has become a standardized feature of political_platforms , and all the many facets of the American version of the welfare_state have become part of the conventional wisdom.
   A national consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts are desirable as_well as necessary.
   Ratified in the Republican_Party victory in 1952 , the Positive State is now evidenced by political_campaigns being waged not on whether but on how much social legislation there should be.
     The general acceptance of the idea of governmental ( i. e. , societal ) responsibility for the economic well-being of the American people is surely one of the two most significant watersheds in American constitutional history.
   The other , of_course , was the Civil_War , the conflict which a century ago insured national unity over fragmentation.
   A third , one of at_least equal and perhaps even greater importance , is now being traversed : American immersion and involvement in world affairs.
     Internal national responsibility , now a truism , need not be documented.
   Nevertheless , it may be helpful to cite one example - that of employment - for , as will be shown below , it cuts_across both facets of the new concept.
   Thirty years ago , while the nation was wallowing in economic depression , the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow  natural forces  to operate and cure the distress.
   That guiding principle of the Hoover_Administration fell to the siege guns of the New_Deal ; less_than a score of years later Congress enacted the Employment_Act of 1946 , by which the national government assumed the responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment.
   Hands-off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through planning - the economic side of the constitutional revolution.
   In 1961 the first important legislative victory of the Kennedy_Administration came when the principle of national responsibility for local economic distress won out over a  state 's - responsibility  proposal - provision was made for payment for unemployment relief by nation-wide taxation rather_than by a levy only on those states afflicted with manpower surplus.
   The American people have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961.
     Internal national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the Industrial_Revolution.
   Reduced to its simplest terms , it is an assumption of a collective duty to compensate IN the inability of individuals to cope_with the rigors of the era.
   National responsibility for individual welfare is a concept not limited to the United_States or even to the Western nations.
   A measure of its widespread acceptance may be derived from a statement of the International_Congress of Jurists in 1959.
   Meeting in New_Delhi under the auspices of the International_Commission of Jurists , a body of lawyers from the free_world , the Congress redefined and expanded the traditional Rule_of_Law to include affirmative governmental duties.
   It is noteworthy that the majority of the delegates to the Congress were from the less developed , former colonial nations.
   The Rule_of_Law , historically a principle according everyone his  day in court  before an impartial tribunal , was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare.
   Recognizing that the Rule_of_Law is  a dynamic concept which should be employed not_only to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society  , the Congress asserted that it also included the responsibility  to establish social , economic , educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized .
   The idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the non-Soviet world.
   For better or for worse , we all now live in welfare_states , the organizing principle of_which is collective responsibility for individual well-being.
     Whether a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility operates in a nation 's external relations is less obvious and more difficult to establish.
   The hypothesis ventured here is that it does , and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition.
   The content is not the same , however : rather_than individual security , it is the security and continuing existence of an  ideological group  - those in the  free_world  - that is basic.
   External national responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of the Western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability of other friendly nations.
   If internal responsibility suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality , then external responsibility implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism.
     Reference_to two other concepts - nationalism and sovereignty - may help to reveal the contours of the new principle.
   In its beginnings the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself - internally , against feudal groups , and externally , against the power and influence of such other claimants for loyalty as the Church.
   The breakup of the Holy_Roman_Empire and the downfall of feudalism led , not more_than two centuries ago , to the surge of nationalism.
   ( Since the time-span of the nation-state coincides roughly with the separate existence of the United_States as an independent entity , it is perhaps natural for Americans to think_of the nation as representative of the highest form of order , something permanent and unchanging.
 )   The concept of nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes and glorifies the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure.
   But it is more_than that.
   For it includes the emotional ties that bind men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large group of people together as a unit.
   Today , as new nations rise from the former colonial empires , nationalism is one of the hurricane forces loose in the world.
   Almost febrile in intensity , the principle has become worldwide in application - unfortunately at the very time that nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm.
   Historically , however , the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the Western civilizational group.
   By subduing disparate lesser groups the nation has , to_some_degree at_least , broadened the capacity for individual liberty.
   Within their confines , moreover , technological and industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace , thus increasing the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied.
   While the pattern is uneven , some having gained more_than others , nationalism has in_fact served the Western peoples well.
   ( Whether historical nationalism helped the peoples of the remainder of the world , and whether today 's nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial aspects , are other questions.
 )     It is one of the ironic quirks of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the territorial state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that the nation-state attained its highest number ( approximately 100 ).
   But it is more_than irony : one of the main reasons why nationalism is no_longer a tenable concept is because it has spread throughout the planet.
   In_other_words , nationalism worked well enough when it had limited application , both as to geography and as to population ; it becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis.
     Complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal_principle of sovereignty.
   The former receives its legitimacy from the latter.
   Operating side_by_side , together they helped shore_up the nation-state.
   While sovereignty has roots in antiquity , in its present usage it is essentially modern.
   Jean_Bodin , writing in the sixteenth century , may have been the seminal thinker , but it was the vastly influential John_Austin who set_out the main_lines of the concept as now understood.
   Austin 's nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty still dominates much of today 's legal and political thinking.
   To him , law is the command of the sovereign ( the_English monarch ) who personifies the power of the nation , while sovereignty is the power to make law - i. e. , to prevail over internal groups and to be free from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations.
   These fundamental ideas - the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual ( internal-external ) aspects - still remain the core of_that concept of ultimate political power.
     The nation-state , then , exemplifies the principle of nationalism and exercises sovereignty : supreme power over domestic affairs and independence from outside control.
   In_fact , however , both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined.
   High-level abstractions are always difficult to pin_down with precision.
   That is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic societies , in_which  popular  sovereignty is said to exist , and in federal nations , in_which the jobs of government are split.
   Nevertheless , nationalism and sovereignty are reputed , in the accepted wisdom , to describe the modern_world.
   Is_there a different reality behind the facade?
   Does the surface hide a quite different picture?
     The short answer to those questions is  yes .
   Both concepts are undergoing alteration ; to_some_degree they are being supplanted by a concept of national responsibility.
   As evidence to support that view , consider the following illustrative instances.
    
    Can thermonuclear war be set_off by_accident?
   What steps have been taken to guard against the one sort_of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continents?
   Are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster?
   Is anything being done to increase our margin of safety?
   Will the danger increase or decrease?
     I have just asked these questions in the Pentagon , in the White_House , in offices of key scientists across_the_country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater , with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain Polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as  Sherwood_Forest .
   I asked the same questions inside the launch-control rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming , where officers who wear sidearms are manning the  commit buttons  that could start a war - accidentally or by_design - and in the command centers where other pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons.
     To the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits , submarine compartments and the antiseptic , windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrow 's impersonal intercontinental wars , the questions seem farfetched.
   There is unceasing pressure , but its sources are immediate.
    Readiness exercises  are almost continuous.
   Each could be the real_thing.
     In the command centers there are special clocks ready_to tick off the minutes elapsed since  E hour .
    E  stands_for  execution  - the moment a  go order  would unleash an American nuclear strike.
   There is little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks.
   They are preoccupied riding_herd_on control_panels , switches , flashing colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look_like business machines.
   They know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details.
   Accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most_of the people who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks.
     Among the policy makers , generals , physicists , psychologists and_others charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their  hardware  , the answers to my questions varied partly according to_a_man 's flair for what the professionals in_this field call  scenarios .
   As an Air_Force psychiatrist put it :  You can n't have dry_runs on this one .
   The experts are thus forced to hypothesize sequences of events that have never occurred , probably never will - but possibly might.
   Only one rule prevailed in my conversations with these men : The more highly placed they are - that_is , the more they know - the more concerned they have become.
     Already accidental war is a silent guest at the discussions within the Kennedy_Administration about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions of national security.
   Only recently new  holes  were discovered in our safety measures , and a search is now on for more.
   Work is under_way to see whether new restraining devices should be_installed on all nuclear_weapons.
     Meanwhile , the experts speak of wars triggered by  false pre-emption  ,  escalation  ,  unauthorized behavior  and other terms that will be discussed in_this report.
   They inhabit a secret world centered on  go codes  and  gold phones .
   Their conversations were , almost invariably , accompanied by the same gestures - arms and pointed forefingers darting toward each other in arclike semicircular motions.
   One arm represented our bombers and missiles , the other arm  theirs .
   Yet implicit_in each movement was the death of millions , perhaps hundreds of millions , perhaps you and me - and the experts.
     These men are not callous.
   It is their job to think_about the unthinkable.
   Unanimously they believe that the world would become a safer place if more of us - and more Russians and Communist Chinese , too - thought_about accidental war.
     The first systematic thinking about this Pandora 's box within Pandora 's boxes was done four years ago by Fred_Ikle , a frail , meek-mannered Swiss-born sociologist.
   He was , and is , with the RAND_Corporation , a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the U._S. Air_Force.
   His investigations made him the Paul_Revere of accidental war , and safety procedures were enormously increased.
     In recent weeks , as a result of a sweeping defense_policy reappraisal by the Kennedy_Administration , basic United_States strategy has been modified - and large new sums allocated - to meet the accidental-war danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible.
     The chain starts at BMEWS ( Ballistic_Missile Early_Warning_System ) in Thule , Greenland.
   Its radar screens would register Soviet missiles shortly after they are launched against the United_States.
   BMEWS intelligence is simultaneously flashed to NORAD ( North_American Air_Defense Command ) in Colorado_Springs , Colorado , for interpretation ; to the SAC command and control post , forty-five feet below the ground at Offutt Air_Force Base , near Omaha , Nebraska ; to the Joint_War_Room of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff in the Pentagon and to the President.
     Telephones , Teletypes , several kinds of radio systems and , in some cases , television , link all vital points.
   Alternate locations exist for all key command centers.
   For last-ditch emergencies SAC has alternate command_posts on KC-135 jet tankers.
   Multiple circuits , routings and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible.
     The same principle of  redundancy  applies to all communications on these special networks.
   And no messages can be transmitted on these circuits until senders and receivers authenticate in_advance , by special codes , that the messages actually come from their purported sources.
   Additional codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications.
     Only the President is permitted to authorize the use of nuclear_weapons.
   That 's the law.
   But what if somebody decides to break it?
   The President cannot personally remove the safety devices from every nuclear trigger.
   He makes the momentous decision.
   Hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers and to push the buttons.
   What if one or more of them turn irrational or suddenly , coolly , decide to clobber the Russians?
   What if the President himself , in the language of the military ,  goes_ape ?
   Or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the Soviets without provocation?
     Nobody can be absolutely certain of the answers.
   However , the system is designed , ingeniously and hopefully , so_that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war.
     Even the President cannot pick_up his telephone and give a  go  order.
   Even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike - the  go code .
   In an emergency he would receive available intelligence on the  gold-phone circuit .
   A system of  gold  - actually yellow - phones connects him with the offices and action stations of the Secretary of Defense , the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , the SAC commander and other key men.
   All can be_connected with the gold circuit from their homes.
   All could help the President make his decision.
   The talk would not be in code , but neither would it ramble.
   Vital questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda.
   Officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured me that the President 's decision could be made and announced on the gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from BMEWS.
     If communications work , his decision would be instantly known in_all command_posts that would originate the actual go order.
   For these centers , too , are on the gold circuit.
   They include the Navy 's Atlantic_Command at Norfolk , Virginia , which is in_contact with the Polaris subs ; NATO headquarters in Europe ; Air_Force forward headquarters in Europe and in the Pacific , which control tactical fighters on ships and land bases ; and SAC , which controls long-range bombers and Atlas missiles.
     Let us look in on one of these nerve_centers - SAC at Omaha - and see what must still happen before a wing of B-52 bombers could drop their H-bombs.
     In a word , plenty.
   The key man almost certainly would be Col._William_W._Wisman , SAC 's senior controller.
   He or his deputy or one of their seven assistants , all full colonels , mans the heart of the command_post twenty-four_hours a day.
   It is a quiet but impressive room - 140 feet long , thirty-nine feet wide , twenty-one feet high.
   Movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts are crammed with intelligence information.
   And Bill_Wisman , forty-three , a farmer 's son from Beallsville , Ohio , is a quiet but impressive man.
   His eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown.
   His movements and speech are precise , clear and quick.
   No question ruffles him or causes him to hesitate.
     Wisman , who has had the chief controller 's job for four years , calls the signals for a team operating three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights , switches and buttons.
   At_least a dozen men , some armed , are never far away from him.
   In_front of him is a gold phone.
   In emergencies the SAC commander , Gen._Thomas_Power , or his deputies and their staff would occupy a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above Wisman and his staff.
   At General_Power 's seat in the balcony there is also a gold phone.
   General_Power would participate in the decision_making.
   Wisman , below , would listen_in and act.
   His consoles can give him instant contact with more_than seventy bases around the world and with every SAC aircraft.
     He need only pick_up one of the two red telephone_receivers at his extreme left , right next to the big red button marked  alert .
   ( There are two receivers in_case one should be dropped and damaged.
 )     But Wisman , too , does not know the go code.
   He must take it from  the red box .
   In_point_of_fact , this is a beige box with a bright red door , about one and a half feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to Wisman 's right.
   The box is internally wired so the door can never be opened without setting_off a screeching klaxon (  It 's real obnoxious  ).
     Now we must become vague , for we are approaching one of the nation 's most guarded secrets.
   The codes in the red box - there are several of them covering various contingencies - are contained in a sealed X-ray-proof  unique device .
   They are supplied , a batch at_a_time , by a secret source and are continually changed by Wisman or his staff , at_random intervals.
     But even the contents of Wisman 's box cannot start a war.
   They are mere fragments , just one portion of preprepared messages.
   What these fragments are and_how they activate the go order may_not be_revealed.
   The pieces must be placed in the context of the prepared messages by Wisman 's staff.
   In_addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures which precede and follow the sending of the go messages , again in special codes , each message also contains an  internal authenticator  , another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting the real_thing.
     I asked Wisman what would happen if he broke_out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one.
    I 'd wind_up full_of.
38 bullet_holes  , he said , and there was no question that he was talking_about bullets fired by his coworkers.
     Now let us imagine a wing of B-52 's , on alert near their  positive control ( or fail-safe ) points  , the spots on the map , many miles from Soviet territory , beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific orders to proceed to their targets.
   They , too , have fragments of the go code with them.
   As Wisman put it ,  They have separate pieces of the pie , and we have the whole pie.
   Once we send_out the whole pie , they can put their pieces into it.
   Unless we send_out the whole pie , their pieces mean nothing .
   Why does Wisman 's ever-changing code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers?
   The answer is a cryptographic secret.
   At_any_rate , three men out of a six-man B-52 crew are required to copy down Wisman 's go-to-war message.
   Each must match Wisman 's  pie  with the fragment that he carries with him.
   All three must compare notes and agree to  go .
     After_that , it requires several minutes of concentrated work , including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber , each with another man beside him to help , for an armed bomb to be_released.
   Unless all gadgets are properly operated - and the wires and seals from the handles removed first - no damage can be done.
    
    Suddenly , however , their posture changed and the game ended.
   They went as rigid as black statuary - six figures , lean and tall and angular , went still.
   Their heads were in_the_air sniffing.
   They all swung at the same instant in the same direction.
   They saw it before I did , even with my binoculars.
   It was nothing more_than a tiny distant rain squall , a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds to the earth.
   In the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree , no_more.
   A white_man would not have seen it.
   The aborigines fastened upon it with a concentration beyond pathos.
   Watching , they waited until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant across the dry burning land.
   At_once the whole band set_off at a lope.
   They were chasing a rain_cloud.
     They went_after the squall as mercilessly as a wolf_pack after an abandoned cow.
   I followed them in the jeep and now they did not care.
   The games were over , this was life.
   Occasionally , for no reason that I could see , they would suddenly alter the angle of their trot.
   Sometimes I guessed it was because the rain squall had changed direction.
   Sometimes it was to skirt a gulley.
   Their gait is impossible to convey in words.
   It has nothing of the proud stride of the trained runner about it , it is not a lope , it is not done with style or verve.
   It is the gait of the human who must run to live : arms dangling , legs barely swinging over the ground , head hung down and only occasionally swinging up_to see the target , a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully graceful.
   It is a barely controlled skimming of the ground.
     They ran for three hours.
   Finally , avoiding hummocks and seeking low ground , they intercepted the rain squall.
   For ten minutes they ran beneath the squall , raising their arms and , for_the_first_time , shouting and capering.
   Then the wind died and the rain squall held steady.
   They were studying the ground.
   Suddenly one of them shouted , ran a_few feet , bent forward and put his mouth to the ground.
   He had found a depression with rain water in it.
   He bent down , a black cranelike figure , and put his mouth to the ground.
     With a lordly and generous gesture , the discoverer stood_up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows.
   The other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle.
   In an instant he had sucked it dry.
     The aborigine lives_on the cruelest land I have ever seen.
   Which does not mean that it is ugly.
   Part of_it is , of_course.
   There are thousands of square_miles of salt pan which are hideous.
   They are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so many centuries that there is no soil left , but only deep bare ridges fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand.
   Such stretches have an inhuman moonlike quality.
   But much of the land which the aborigine wanders looks as if it should be hospitable.
   It is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush , has a peaceful quality , the hills roll softly.
     The malignancy of such a landscape has been beautifully described by the Australian Charles_Bean.
   He tells of three men who started_out on a trip across a single paddock , a ten-by-ten-mile square owned by a sheep grazer.
   They went well-equipped with everything except knowledge of the  outback  country.
    The countryside looked_like a beautiful open park with gentle slopes and soft gray tree-clumps.
   Nothing appalling or horrible rushed upon these men.
   Only there happened - nothing.
   There might have been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps : only - there was not.
   It might have rained , any time ; only - it did not.
   There might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise ; only - there was not.
   They lay , with the_birds hopping from branch to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them.
   No one came .
     The white_men died.
   And countless others like them have died.
   Even today range riders will come_upon mummified bodies of men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly lost direction , were tortured by the heat , driven mad by the constant and unfulfilled promise of the landscape , and who finally died.
     The aborigine is not deceived ; he knows that the land is hard and pitiless.
   He knows that the economy of life in the  outback  is awful.
   There is no room for error or waste.
   Any organism that falters or misperceives the signals or weakens is done.
   I do not know if such a way_of_life can come to be a self-conscious challenge , but I suspect that it can.
   Perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his odd air of dignity.
     Seeing an aborigine today is a difficult thing.
   Many_of them have drifted into the cities and towns and seaports.
   Others are confined to vast reservations , and not_only does the Australian government justifiably not wish them to be viewed_as exhibits in a zoo , but on their reservations they are extremely fugitive , shunning camps , coming together only for corroborees at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch - which is very low indeed.
     I persuaded an Australian friend who had lived  outback  for years to take me to see some aborigines living in the bush.
   It was a difficult and ambiguous kind_of negotiation , even_though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge of the aborigines and their language.
   Finally , however , the arrangements were made and we drove out into the bush in a Land_Rover.
   We followed the asphalt road for a_few miles and_then swung off onto a smaller road which was nothing more_than two tire marks on the earth.
   The rancher went a mile down this road and_then , when he reached a big red boulder , swung off the road.
   At_once he started to glance toward the instrument_panel.
   It took me a moment to realize what was odd about that panel : there was a gimbaled compass welded to_it , which rocked gently back_and_forth as the Land_Rover bounced about.
   The rancher was navigating his way across the flatland.
      Do you always navigate like this ?
   I asked.
      Damned right  , he said.
    Once I get out on the flat I do.
   Some chaps that know an area well can make their way by landmarks - a tree here , a wash here , a boulder there.
   But if you do n't know the place like the palm of your hand , you 'd better use a compass and the speedometer.
   Two miles northeast , then five miles southwest - that sort_of thing.
   Very simple .
     He was right.
   The landscape kept repeating itself.
   I would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was hopeless.
   Finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines.
   They were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder : a man , his lubra , and two children.
   The sun was not_yet high and all_of them were in the small area of shade cast by the boulder.
     There was also a dog , a dingo dog.
   Its ribs showed , it was a yellow nondescript color , it suffered from a variety of sores , hair had scabbed off its body in patches.
   It lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving , watching us carefully.
   It struck me as a very bright and very malnourished dog.
   No one patted the dog.
   It was not a pet.
   It was a worker.
      The buggers love shade  , the rancher said.
    I suppose because it saves them some loss of body water.
   They 'll move around that rock all day , following the shade.
   During the hottest part of the day , of_course , the sun comes straight down and there is n't any shade .
     We drove close_to the boulder , stopped the Land_Rover , and walked over toward the family.
     The man was leaning_against the rock.
   He gazed away from us as we approached.
   He was over six feet tall and very thin.
   His legs were narrow and very long.
   Every bone and muscle in his body showed , but he did not give the appearance of starving.
   He had long black hair and a wispy beard.
   The ridges over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut.
   There was something about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds to realize what.
   It was not merely that flies were crawling over his face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into his eye_sockets.
   A fly would crawl down the bulging forehead , into the socket of the eye , walk along the man 's lashes and across the wet surface of the eyeball , and the eye did not blink.
   The Australian and I both were wearing insect_repellent and were not badly bothered by insects , but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine.
     I turned to look at the lubra.
   She remained squatting on her heels all_the_time we were there ; like the man , she was entirely naked.
   Her long thin arms moved in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family possessions which were placed in_front of her.
   There were two rubbing sticks for making fire , two stones shaped roughly like knives , a woven-root container which held a_few pounds of dried worms and the dead_body of some rodent.
   There was also a long wooden spear and a woomera , a spear-throwing device which gives the spear an enormous velocity and high accuracy.
   There was also a boomerang , elaborately carved.
   Everything was burnished with sweat and grease so_that all_of the objects seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless.
     The two children , both boys , wandered around the Australian and me for a_few moments and_then returned to their work.
   They squatted on their heels with their heads bent far forward , their eyes only a_few inches from the ground.
   They had located the runway of a colony of ants and as the ants came_out of the ground , the boys picked them up , one at_a_time , and pinched them dead.
   The tiny bodies , dropped onto a dry leaf , made a pile as big as a small apple.
     The odor here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines.
   The smell at_first was more surprising than unpleasant.
   It was also subtly familiar , for it was the odor of the human_body , but multiplied innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathed.
   One 's impulse is to say that the smell was a stink and unpleasant.
   But that is a cliche and a dishonest one.
   The smell is sexual , but so powerfully so_that a civilized nose must deny it.
     Their skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost the consistency of a second skin.
   They roll at night in ashes to keep warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to_it.
   In_spots such_as the elbows and knees the second skin is worn_off and I realized the aborigines were much darker than they appeared ; as if the coating of sweat , dirt , and ashes were a cosmetic.
   The boys had beautiful dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies and blinked their eyes.
      That smell is something , eh , mate ?
 the Australian asked.
    They swear that every person smells different and every family smells different from every_other.
   At the corroborees , when they get_to dancing and sweating , you 'll see them rubbing up against a man who 's supposed to have a specially good smell.
   Idje , here  , and he nodded at the man ,  is said to have great odor.
   The stink is all_the_same to me , but I really think they can make one another out blindfolded .
      Here , Idje , you fella like tabac ?
 he said sharply.
   Idje still stared over our shoulders at the horizon.
   The Australian stopped trying to talk a pidgin I could understand , and spoke strange words from deep in his chest.
    
    It was a fortunate time in_which to build , for the seventeenth century was a great period in Persian art.
   The architects , the tile and carpet makers , the potters , painters , calligraphers , and metalsmiths worked through Abbas 's reign and those of his successors to enrich the city.
   Travelers entering from the desert were confounded by what must have seemed an illusion : a great garden filled with nightingales and roses , cut by canals and terraced promenades , studded with water_tanks of turquoise tile in_which were reflected the glistening blue curves of a_hundred domes.
   At the heart of all_of this was the square , which one such traveler declared to be  as spacious , as pleasant and aromatick a Market as any in the Universe .
   In_time Isfahan came to be known as  half the world  , Isfahan_nisf-i-jahan.
     In the early eighteenth century this fantastic city , then the size of London , started to decline.
   The Afghans invaded ; the Safavids fell from power ; the capital went elsewhere ; the desert encroached.
   Isfahan became more of a legend than a place , and now it is for many people simply a name to_which they attach their notions of old Persia and sometimes of the East.
   They think_of it as a kind_of spooky museum in_which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor.
     Those who actually get there find that it is n't spooky at_all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight.
   But even for them it remains a museum , or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb , a tomb in_which Persia lies well preserved but indeed dead.
   Everyone is ready to grant the Persians their history , but almost_no one is willing to acknowledge their present.
   It seems that for Persia , and especially for this city , there are only two_times : the glorious past and the corrupt , depressing , sterile present.
   The one apparent connection between the two is a score of buildings which somehow or other have survived and which naturally enough are_called  historical monuments .
     However , just_as all the buildings have not fallen and flowed back to their original mud , so the values which wanted them and saw that they were_built have not all disappeared.
   The values and talents which made the tile and the dome , the rug , the poem and the miniature , continue in certain social institutions which rise above the ordinary life of_this city , as the great buildings rise above blank walls and dirty lanes.
   Often , too , the social institutions are housed in these pavilions and palaces and bridges , for these great structures are not simply  historical monuments  ; they are the places where Persians live.
     The promenade , for_example , continues to take_place on the Chahar_Bagh , a mile-long garden of plane and poplar_trees that now serves as the city 's principal street.
  ?
   t takes_place as_well along the terraces and through the arcades of the Khaju bridge , and also in the gardens of the square.
   On Fridays , the day when many Persians relax with poetry , talk , and a samovar , people do not , it is true , stream into Chehel_Sotun - a pavilion and garden built by Shah_Abbas 2 , in the seventeenth century - but they do retire into hundreds of pavilions throughout the city and up the river valley , which are smaller , more humble copies of the former.
   And of_course religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques , and commercial life - very_much a social institution - in the bazaar.
   Those three other great activities of the Persians , the bath , the teahouse , and the zur khaneh ( the latter a kind_of club in_which a leader and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics , dance , chanted poetry , and music ) , do not take_place in buildings to_which entrance tickets are sold , but some of them occupy splendid examples of Persian domestic architecture :   long , domed , chalk-white rooms with daises of turquoise tile , their end walls cut_through to the orchards and the sky by open arches.
     But more important , and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often do not see , is that these places and activities are often the settings in_which Persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities.
   Water , air , fruit , poetry , music , the human form - these things are important to Persians , and they experience them with an intense and discriminating awareness.
     I should like , by_the_way , to make it clear that I am not using the word  Persians  carelessly.
   I do n't mean a_few aesthetes who play about with sensations , like a young prince in a miniature dabbling his hand in a pool.
   These things are important to almost all Persians and perhaps most important to the_most ordinary.
   The men crying love poems in an orchard on any summer 's night are as often as not the lutihaw , mustachioed toughs who spend most_of their lives in and out of the local prisons , brothels , and teahouses.
   A_few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord who in the dead of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from a spring famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor.
   Not_long ago an acquaintance , a slick-headed water_rat of a lad up from the maw of the city , stood on the balcony puffing his first cigarette in weeks.
   The air , he said , was just_right ; a cigarette would taste particularly good.
   I really did n't know what he meant.
   It was a nice day , granted.
   But he knew ; he sniffed the air and licked it on his lip and knew as a vintner knows a vintage.
     The natural world then , plus poetry and some kinds of art , receives from the_most ordinary of Persians a great_deal of attention.
   The line of an eyebrow , the color of the skin , a ghazal from Hafiz , the purity of spring_water , the long afternoon among the boughs which crowd the upper story of a pavilion - these things are noticed , judged , and valued.
     Nowhere in Isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the Persians shown so well as during the promenade at the Khaju bridge.
   There has probably always been a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the city.
   For_one_thing , there is a natural belt of rock across the river_bed ; for another , it was here that one of the old caravan routes came_in.
   It was to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans , and also to make a pleasance for the city , that Shah_Abbas 2 , in about 1657 built , of sun-baked brick , tile , and stone , the present bridge.
   It is a splendid structure.
   From upstream it looks_like a long arcaded box laid across the river ; from downstream , where the water_level is much lower , it is a high , elaborately facaded pavilion.
     The top story contains more_than thirty alcoves separated from each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile.
   At either end and in_the_center there are bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed and capacious as church apses.
   Here , in the old days - when they had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks - sat the king and his court while priests , soldiers , and other members of the party lounged in the smaller alcoves between.
     Below , twenty vaults tunnel through the understructure of the bridge.
   These are traversed by another line of vaults , and thus rooms , arched on all four sides , are formed.
   Down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing vista like a visual echo of piers and arches , while the vaults fronting upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise , the mountains and river pools.
   Here , on the hottest day , it is cool beneath the stone and fresh from the water flowing in the sluices at the bottom of the vaults.
     On the downstream , or  pavilion  , side these vaults give out onto terraces twice_as wide as the bridge itself.
   From the terraces - eighteen in_all - broad flights_of_steps descend into the water or onto still more terraces barely above the level of the river.
   Out of water , brick , and tile they have made far more_than just a bridge.
     On spring and summer evenings people leave their shops and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge.
   It is a great spectacle.
   The bridge itself rises up from the river , light-flared and enormous , like the outdoor set for an epic opera.
   Crowds press along the terraces , down the steps , in and out of the arcades , massing against it as though it were a fortress under siege.
   All kinds come to walk in the promenade :   merchants from the bazaar bickering over a deal ; a Bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket ; dervishes who stand with the stillness of the blind , their eyes filmed with rheum and visions ; the old Kajar princes arriving in their ancient limousines ; students , civil_servants , beggars , musicians , hawkers , and clowns.
   Families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit on carpets around a samovar.
   Below , people line the steps , as though on bleachers , to watch the sky and river.
   Above , in the tiled prosceniums of the alcoves , boys sing the ghazals of Hafiz and Saadi , while at the very bottom , in the vaults , the toughs and blades of the city hoot and bang their drums , drink arak , play dice , and dance.
     Here in an evening Persians enjoy many_of the things which are important to them : poetry , water , the moon , a beautiful face.
   To a stranger their delight in these things may seem paradoxical , for Persians chase the golden_calf as much_as any people.
   Many_of them , moreover , are beginning to complain about the scarcity of Western amusements and to ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant , the mullah , and the peasant.
   Nonetheless , they take time_out - much time - from the game of grab and these new Western experiments to go_to the gardens and riverbanks.
   Above_all , they will stop in_the_middle of anything , anywhere , to hear or quote some poetry.
     Poetry in Persian life is far more_than a common ground on_which - in a society deeply fissured by antagonisms - all may stand.
   It contains , in_fact , their whole outlook on life.
   And it is expressed , at_least to their taste , in a perfect form.
   Poetry for a Persian is nothing less_than truth and beauty.
   In most Western cultures today these twins have been sent away to the libraries and museums.
   In Persia , where practically speaking there are no museums or libraries or , for_that_matter , hardly_any books , the twins run free.
     It is perhaps difficult to conceive , but imagine that tonight on London bridge the Teddy_boys of the East End will gather to sing Marlowe , Herrick , Shakespeare , and perhaps some lyrics of their own.
   That , at_any_rate , is what happens at the Khaju bridge.
   Boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the top arcade.
   Here in these little rooms - or stages arched open_to the sky and river - they choose a_few lines out of the hundreds they may know and sing them according to one of the modes into which Persian music is divided.
   Each mode is believed to have a specific attribute - one inducing pleasure , another generosity , another love , and_so_on , to include all_of the emotions.
   The singer simply matches the poem to a mode ; for_example , the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk poem :  They brought me news that Spring is in the plains And Ahmad 's blood the crimson tulip stains ; Go , tell his aged mother that her son Fought with a_thousand foes , and he was one .
   Or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet :  Know ye , fair folk who dwell on earth Or shall hereafter come to birth , That here , with dust upon his eyes , Iraj , the sweet-tongued singer , lies.
   In_this true lover 's tomb interred A world of love lies sepulchred .
     These songs ( practically all Persian music , for_that_matter ) are limited to a range of two octaves.
   Yet within this limitation there is an astonishing variety : design as intricate as that in the carpet or miniature , with the melodic_line like the painted or woven line often flowing into an arabesque.
    
    Die Frist ist um , und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben Jahr , the Maestro quoted The Flying_Dutchman , as he told of his career and wanderings , explaining that the number seven had significantly recurred in his life several_times.
     The music_director of the Pittsburgh Symphony_Orchestra , William_Steinberg , has molded his group into a prominent musical_organization , which is his life.
   When he added to his Pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the London_Philharmonic_Orchestra in 1958 , he conducted one_hundred fifty concerts within nine months ,  commuting  between the two cities.
   This schedule became too strenuous , even for the energetic and conscientious Mr._Steinberg.
   His London contract was rescinded , and now , he explains cheerfully , as a bright smile lightens his intense , mobile face ,  I conduct only one_hundred and twenty concerts !
     Our meeting took_place in May , 1961 , during one of the Maestro 's stop-overs in New_York , before he left for Europe.
   As we began to converse in the lounge of his Fifth_Avenue hotel , his restlessness and sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent.
   Seeking an obscure , dark , relatively quiet corner in the airy room otherwise suffused with afternoon sunshine , he asked if the soft background music could be turned_off.
   Unfortunately , it was Muzak , which automatically is piped_into the public rooms , and which nolens volens had to be endured.
   As he talked_about himself , time_and_again stuffing and dragging on his pipe , Steinberg began to relax and the initial hurried feeling grew faint and was dispelled.
     Did he come from a musical family?
   Yes : though not professional musicians , they were a music-loving family.
   In his native Cologne , where his mother taught him to play the piano , he was able to read notes before he learned the alphabet.
   She even devised a system of colors , whereby the boy could easily distinguish the different note values.
   When he started school at the age of five-and-a-half , he could not understand why the alphabet begins with the letter A , instead of C , as in the scale.
   Because , like many other children , he intensely disliked practicing Czerny_Etudes , he composed his own studies.
   When he was eight he began violin_lessons.
   Soon he was playing in the Cologne_Municipal_Orchestra , and during World_War 1 , , when musicians were scarce , he joined the opera orchestra as_well.
   Steinberg claims that these early years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career.
    By observing the conductor  , he says with a twinkle in his eyes ,  I learned how not to conduct .
     The musician ran_away from school when he was fifteen , but this escapade did not save him from the Gymnasium.
   Simultaneously , he pursued his musical studies at the conservatory , receiving sound training in counterpoint and harmony , as_well in the violin and piano.
   His professional career began when he was twenty ; he became Otto_Klemperer 's personal assistant at the Cologne_Opera , and a year later was promoted to the position of regular conductor.
     Was n't this an unusually young age to fill such a responsible post?
   Yes , the Maestro assented.
     Had he always wished to be a conductor?
   No , originally he had hoped to become a concert pianist and had even performed as_such.
   However , when he assumed the duties of a conductor , he relinquished his career as a pianist.
     Five years were spent with the Cologne_Opera , after which he was called to Prague by Alexander_von_Zemlinsky , teacher of Arnold_Scho ^ nberg and Erich_Korngold.
   In 1927 he succeeded Zemlinsky as opera director of the German Theater at Prague.
   During his tenure he also fulfilled guest engagements at the Berlin_State_Opera.
   Two years later he became director of the Frankfurt_Opera , where he remained until he lost this position in 1933 through the rise of the Hitler regime.
   During these years the youthful conductor had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in Germany.
   He had presented the first German performances of Puccini 's Manon_Lescaut and de Falla 's La_Vida_Breve.
   The Frankfurt years were particularly noteworthy for his performance of Berg 's Wozzek soon after the Berlin premiere under Erich_Kleiber , and the world premiere of Scho ^ nberg 's Von heute auf morgen.
   At the outset of his career , Steinberg had dedicated himself to the advancement of contemporary music by vowing to do a Scho ^ nberg work every_year.
   In Frankfurt , too , he directed the Museum and Opera_House concerts which , in_addition to the standard repertoire , featured novelties like Erdmann 's Piano_Concerto and Mahler 's Sixth_Symphony.
     Because of the political upheaval in Germany in the 1930 's , Steinberg was forced to restrict his activities to the Jewish community.
   Through the Frankfurt_Jewish_Kulturbund he began to give sonata recitals in synagogues , with Cellist_Emanuel_Feuermann.
   As more_and_more Jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional organizations Steinberg united them into the Frankfurt_Kulturbund_Orchestra , which also gave guest performances in other German cities.
   In 1936 he accepted the leadership of the Berlin_Kulturbund.
   In the fall of_that year the best musicians of the Berlin and Frankfurt_Kulturbund orchestras joined under the combined efforts of Bronislaw_Hubermann and Steinberg to become the Palestine_Orchestra - now known as the Israel_Philharmonic_Orchestra - with Steinberg as founder-conductor.
     In 1938 , at the insistence of Arturo_Toscanini , Steinberg left Germany for the United_States , by way of Switzerland.
   After he had spent the first three years in New_York as associate conductor , at Toscanini 's invitation , of the NBC_Orchestra , he made numerous guest appearances throughout the United_States and Latin_America.
   In 1945 he became conductor of the Buffalo_Philharmonic.
   Seven years later he was asked to become director of the Pittsburgh_Symphony.
   Since 1944 he has also conducted regularly at the San_Francisco Opera , where he made his debut with a memorable performance of Verdi 's Falstaff.
   In recent years he has traveled widely in Europe , conducting in Italy , France , Austria , and Switzerland.
   He returned to Germany for_the_first_time in 1953 , where he has since conducted in Cologne , Frankfurt , and Berlin.
     Where in Europe was he going now?
     First_of_all , to Italy for a short vacation - Forte_dei_Marmi , a place he loves.
   Since it is not far from Viareggio , he will visit Puccini 's house , as he never fails to do , to pay his respects_to the memory of the composer of La_Boheme , which he considers one of Puccini 's masterpieces.
   Steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm about Italy :  Rome is my second home.
   I consider it the center of the world and make it a point to be there once a year .
   He will conduct two concerts at the Accademia_di_Santa_Cecilia , as_well as concerts in Munich and Cologne.
    Then I return to the United_States for engagements at the Hollywood_Bowl and in Philadelphia  , he added.
     The forthcoming season in Pittsburgh also promises to be of unusual interest.
   There will be premieres of new works , made possible through Ford_Foundation commissions : Carlisle_Floyd 's Mystery , with Phyllis_Curtin as soprano soloist.
   Other world premieres will be Gardner_Read 's Third_Symphony and Burle_Marx 's Samba_Concertante.
      And next year we will do - also a Ford commission - a piano concerto by Elliott_Carter , with Jacob_Lateiner as soloist.
   Of_course , I shall conduct Mahler and Bruckner works in the coming season , as_usual.
   We 'll play Bruckner 's Fifth_Symphony in the original version , and Mahler 's Seventh - the_least accessible , known , and played of Mahler 's works.
   My Pittsburghers have become real addicts to Mahler and Bruckner .
     He added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters on_tour , especially Mahler 's First and Fourth symphonies , and Das_Lied_von_der_Erde , and Bruckner 's Sixth - which is rarely played - and Seventh.
   Bruckner 's Eighth he refers to as  my travel symphony .
   He recalled that in California after a critic had attacked him for  still trying to sell Bruckner to the Americans  , the public 's response at the next concert was a standing_ovation.
      Now that Bruno_Walter is virtually in retirement and my dear friend Dimitri_Mitropoulos is no_longer with us , I am probably the only one - with the possible exception of Leonard_Bernstein - who has this special affinity for and champions the works of Bruckner and Mahler .
     Since he introduces so_much modern music , I could not resist asking how he felt about it.
      There was always and at_all_times a contemporary music and it expresses the era in_which it was created.
   But I usually stick_to the old phrase : ' Ich habe ein Amt , aber keine Meinung ( I hold an office , but I do not feel entitled to have an opinion ).
   I consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being written today .
     With all his musical activities , did he have the time and inclination to do anything else?
   He had just paid a brief visit to the Frick_Collection to admire his favorite paintings by Rembrandt and Franz_Hals.
   He was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired Claude_Lorrain , but reminisced with pleasure over a Poussin exhibit he had been able to see in Paris a year ago.
     And_how did he feel about modern art?
   Again Steinberg was cautious and replied with a smile that he was not exposed to_it enough to hazard comments.
    As my wife puts it  , he said , again with a twinkle in his eyes ,  all you know is your music.
   But after_all , you never learned anything else !
     What did he do for relaxation?
   Like his late colleague , Mitropoulos , he reads mystery_stories , in_particular Sir_Arthur_Conan_Doyle.
   He cited Heine and Stendhal as favorites in literature.
     But his prime interest , apart from music , he insisted seriously , was his family - his wife , daughter and son.
   At the moment he was excited about his son 's having received the Prix de Rome in archaeology and was looking_forward to being present this summer at the excavation of an Etruscan tomb.
    Both children are musical and my wife is a music_lover of unfailing instinct and judgment .
    Is the attitude of German youth comparable_to that of  the angry young_men ' of England ?
 was the topic for a round-table discussion at the Bayerische_Rundfunk in Munich.
     I was chairman , the only not youthful participant.
   Since attack serves to stimulate interest in broadcasts , I added to my opening statement a sentence in_which I claimed that German youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which is a necessary ingredient of anger , and might be classified as uninterested and bored rather_than angry.
   I was far from convinced of the truth of my statement , but could not think_of anything that might evoke responses more_quickly.
      It is easy for you to talk  ; countered a twenty year old law_student ,  you travel around the world.
   We would like to do that too .
      But you want a job guaranteed when you return  , I continued my attack.
    You must have some security  , said a young clerk.
     When I mentioned that for my first long voyage I did not even have the money for the return fare , but had trusted to luck that I would earn a sufficient amount , the young people looked at me doubtingly.
   One girl expressed what was obviously in their minds.
      Would you advise us to act the same way?
   You might have failed.
   I think it is rather foolhardy to trust to luck .
     Others mentioned that I might have had to ask friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in_a_foreign_country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international understanding.
     The debate needed no additional controversy and soon I could ask each individually what he expected from life , what his hopes were and what his fears.
     Though the four boys and two girls , the youngest nineteen years of_age , the oldest twenty-four , came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal interests , there was surprising agreement among them.
   What they wished for most was security ; what they feared most was war or political instability in their own country.
     The ideal home , they agreed , would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms , just enough for a family consisting_of husband , wife , and two children.
   No one wanted a larger family or no children , and none hoped_for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would be satisfactory.
     All expressed interest in world affairs but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest.
    
    Once_again , as in the days of the Founding Fathers , America faces a stern test.
   That test , as President_Kennedy forthrightly depicted it in his State of the Union message , will determine  whether a nation organized and governed such_as ours can endure .
     It is well then that in_this hour both of  national peril  and of  national opportunity  we can take_counsel with the men who made the nation.
   Incapable_of self-delusion , the Founding Fathers found the crisis of their time to be equally grave , and yet they had confidence that America would surmount it and that a republic of free peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty.
     Seven Founders - George_Washington , Benjamin_Franklin , John_Adams , Thomas_Jefferson , Alexander_Hamilton , James_Madison and John_Jay - determined the destinies of the new nation.
   In certain respects , their task was incomparably greater than ours today , for there was nobody before them to show them the way.
   As Madison commented to Jefferson in 1789 ,  We are in a wilderness without a single footstep to guide us.
   Our successors will have an easier task .
     They thought_of themselves , to use Jefferson 's words , as  the Argonauts  who had lived in  the Heroic_Age .
   Accordingly , they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential sources for posterity.
   Their writings assume more_than dramatic or patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in_which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but , rather , as Washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen , that  with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved .
     Strong men with strong opinions , frank to_the_point of being refreshingly indiscreet , the Founding Seven were essentially congenial minds , and their agreements with each other were more consequential than their differences.
   Even_though in most cases the completion of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off , enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual feats of winning American independence and founding a new nation.
     Before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember that their separate careers were extraordinary.
   Certainly no other seven American statesmen from any later period achieved so_much in so concentrated a span of years.
     Eldest of the seven , Benjamin_Franklin , a New_Englander transplanted to Philadelphia , wrote the_most dazzling success story in our history.
   The young printer 's apprentice achieved greatness in a half-dozen different fields , as editor and publisher , scientist , inventor , philanthropist and statesman.
   Author of the Albany_Plan of Union , which , had it been adopted , might have avoided the Revolution , he fought the colonists ' front-line battles in London , negotiated the treaty of alliance with France and the peace that ended the war , headed the state_government of Pennsylvania , and exercised an important moderating influence at the Federal_Convention.
     On a military_mission for his native Virginia the youthful George_Washington touched_off the_French and Indian_War , then guarded his colony 's frontier as head of its militia.
   Commanding the Continental_Army for six long years of the Revolution , he was the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory.
   Retiring to his beloved Mount_Vernon , he returned to preside over the Federal_Convention , and was the only man in history to be unanimously elected President.
   During his two terms the Constitution was tested and found workable , strong national policies were inaugurated , and the traditions and powers of the Presidential office firmly fixed.
     John_Adams fashioned much of pre-Revolutionary radical ideology , wrote the constitution of his home state of Massachusetts , negotiated , with Franklin and Jay , the peace with Britain and served as our first Vice_President and our second President.
     His political opponent and lifetime friend , Thomas_Jefferson , achieved immortality through his authorship of the Declaration_of_Independence , but equally notable were the legal and constitutional reforms he instituted in his native Virginia , his role as father of our territorial system , and his acquisition of the Louisiana_Territory during his first term as President.
     During the greater part of Jefferson 's career he enjoyed the close collaboration of a fellow Virginian , James_Madison , eight years his junior.
   The active sponsor of Jefferson 's measure for religious liberty in Virginia , Madison played the_most influential single role in the drafting of the Constitution and in securing its ratification in Virginia , founded the first political_party in American history , and , as Jefferson 's Secretary_of_State and his successor in the Presidency , guided the nation through the troubled years of our second war with Britain.
     If Franklin was an authentic genius , then Alexander_Hamilton , with his exceptional precocity , consuming energy , and high ambition , was a political prodigy.
   His revolutionary pamphlets , published when he was only 19 , quickly brought him to the attention of the patriot leaders.
   Principal author of  The Federalist  , he swung New_York over from opposition to the Constitution to ratification almost single-handedly.
   His collaboration with Washington , begun when he was the general 's aide during the Revolution , was resumed when he entered the first Cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury.
   His bold fiscal program and his broad interpretation of the Constitution stand as durable contributions.
     Less dazzling than Hamilton , less eloquent than Jefferson , John_Jay commands an equally high rank among the Founding Fathers.
   He served as president of the Continental_Congress.
   He played the leading role in negotiating the treaty with Great_Britain that ended the Revolution , and directed America 's foreign affairs throughout the Confederation period.
   As first Chief_Justice , his strong nationalist opinions anticipated John_Marshall.
   He ended his public career as a two-term governor of New_York.
     These Seven Founders constituted an intellectual and social elite , the_most respectable and disinterested leadership any revolution ever confessed.
   Their social_status was achieved in some cases by birth , as with Washington , Jefferson and Jay ; in others by business and professional acumen , as with Franklin and Adams , or , in Hamilton 's case , by an influential marriage.
   Unlike so many_of the power-starved intellectuals in underdeveloped nations of our own day , they commanded both prestige and influence before the Revolution started.
     As different physically as the tall , angular Jefferson was from the chubby , rotund Adams , the seven were striking individualists.
   Ardent , opinionated , even obstinate , they were amazingly articulate , wrote their own copy , and were masters of phrasemaking.
     Capable_of enduring friendships , they were also stout controversialists , who could write with a drop of vitriol on their pens.
   John_Adams dismissed John_Dickinson , who voted against the Declaration_of_Independence , as  a certain great fortune and piddling genius .
   Washington castigated his critic , General_Conway , as being capable_of  all the meanness of intrigue to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity .
   And Hamilton , who felt it  a religious duty  to oppose Aaron_Burr 's political ambitions , would have been a better actuarial risk had he shown more literary restraint.
     The Seven Founders were completely dedicated_to the public_service.
   Madison once remarked :  My life has been so_much a public one  , a comment which fits the careers of the other six.
   Franklin retired from editing and publishing at the age of 42 , and for the next forty-two years devoted himself to public , scientific , and philanthropic interests.
   Washington never had a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved best , plantation management.
   He served as Commander_in_Chief during the Revolution without compensation.
     John_Adams took_to_heart the advice given him by his legal mentor , Jeremiah_Gridley , to  pursue the study of the law , rather_than the gain of_it .
   In taking account of seventeen years of law_practice , Adams concluded that  no lawyer in America ever did so_much business as I did  and  for so little profit .
   When the Revolution broke_out , he , along with Jefferson and Jay , abandoned his career at the bar , with considerable financial sacrifice.
     Hamilton , poorest of the seven , gave_up a brilliant law_practice to enter Washington 's Cabinet.
   While he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of the Government he had_to resort to borrowing small sums from friends.
    If you can conveniently let me have twenty dollars  , he wrote one friend in 1791 when he was Secretary of the Treasury.
     To support his large family Hamilton went_back to the law after each spell of public_service.
   Talleyrand passed his New_York law office one night on_the_way to a party.
   Hamilton was bent over his desk , drafting a legal paper by the light of a candle.
   The Frenchman was astonished.
    I have just come from viewing a man who had made the fortune of his country , but now is working all night in_order_to support his family  , he reflected.
     All seven combined ardent devotion to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality.
   John_Adams asserted in the Continental_Congress ' Declaration of Rights that the demands of the_colonies were in_accordance_with their charters , the_British Constitution and the common_law , and Jefferson appealed in the Declaration_of_Independence  to the tribunal of the world  for support of a revolution justified by  the laws_of_nature and of nature 's God .
     They fought hard , but they were forgiving to former foes , and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures from confiscating Tory property in violation of the Treaty of 1783.
     This sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplified in an exchange of letters between John_Jay and a Tory refugee , Peter_Van_Schaack.
   Jay had participated in the decision that exiled his old friend Van_Schaack.
   Yet when , at_war 's end , the ex-Tory made the first move to resume correspondence , Jay wrote him from Paris , where he was negotiating the peace settlement :      As an independent American I considered all who were not for us , and you amongst the rest , as against us , yet be assured that John_Jay never ceased to be the friend of Peter_Van_Schaack .
     The latter in_turn assured him that  were I arraigned at the bar , and you my judge , I should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause .
     All seven recognized that independence was but the first_step toward building a nation.
    We have now a national character to establish  , Washington wrote in 1783.
    Think continentally  , Hamilton counseled the young nation.
   This new force , love_of_country , super-imposed upon - if_not displacing - affectionate ties to one 's own state , was epitomized by Washington.
   His first inaugural_address speaks of  my country whose voice I can never hear but with veneration and love .
     All sought the fruition of_that nationalism in a Federal_Government with substantial powers.
   Save Jefferson , all participated in the framing or ratification of the Federal_Constitution.
   They supported it , not as a perfect instrument , but as the best obtainable.
   Historians have traditionally regarded the great debates of the Seventeen Nineties as polarizing the issues of centralized vs. limited government , with Hamilton and the nationalists supporting the former and Jefferson and Madison upholding the latter position.
     The state 's rights position was formulated by Jefferson and Madison in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolves , but in their later careers as heads_of_state the two proved themselves better Hamiltonians than Jeffersonians.
   In purchasing Louisiana , Jefferson had_to adopt Hamilton 's broad construction of the Constitution , and so did Madison in advocating the rechartering of Hamilton 's bank , which he had so strenuously opposed at its inception , and in adopting a Hamiltonian protective_tariff.
   Indeed , the old Jeffersonians were far more atune to the Hamilton-oriented Whigs than they were to the Jacksonian Democrats.
     When , in 1832 , the South_Carolina nullifiers adopted the principle of state interposition which Madison had advanced in his old Virginia_Resolve , they elicited no encouragement from_that senior statesman.
   In his political testament ,  Advice to My Country  , penned just before his death , Madison expressed the wish  that the Union of the States be cherished and perpetuated.
   Let the open enemy to_it be regarded_as a Pandora with her box opened ; and the disguised one , as the serpent creeping with his deadly wiles into Paradise .
    
    Nostalgic Yankee readers of Erskine_Caldwell are today informed by proud Georgians that Tobacco_Road is buried beneath a four-lane super highway , over which travel each_day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the Dow-Jones average than with the cotton crop.
   Thus we are compelled to face the urbanization of the South - an urbanization which , despite its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the Southern culture , has been utterly ignored by the bulk of Southern writers.
   Indeed , it seems that only in today 's Southern fiction does Tobacco_Road , with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint_juleps , continue to live - but only as a weary , overexploited phantom.
     Those writers known collectively as the  Southern school  have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize ; according to many critics , in_fact , the South has led the North in literature since the Civil_War , both quantitatively and qualitatively.
   Such writers as William_Faulkner and Robert_Penn_Warren have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort_of post-bellum renaissance.
   It is interesting , however , that despite this strong upsurge in Southern writing , almost none of the writers has forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel sipping a mint_julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the season 's cotton and tobacco crops ; of the stereotyped Negro servants chanting hymns as they plow the fields ; of these and a host of other antiquated legends that deny the South its progressive leaps of the past century.
   This is not to say that the South is no_longer agrarian ; such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification.
   But the South is , and has been for the past century , engaged in a wide-sweeping urbanization which , oddly_enough , is not reflected in its literature.
     In 1900 the South was only 15 % urban ; in 1950 it had become 47.1 % urban.
   In a mere half-century the South has more_than tripled its urban status.
   There is a New_South emerging , a South losing the folksy traditions of an agrarian society with the rapidity of an avalanche - especially within recent decades.
   As the New_South snowballs toward further urbanization , it becomes more_and_more homogeneous with the North - a tendency which Willard_Thorp terms  Yankeefication  , as evidenced in such cities as Charlotte , Birmingham , and Houston.
   It is said that , even at the present stage of Southern urbanization , such a city as Atlanta is not distinctly unlike Columbus or Trenton.
   Undoubtedly even the old Southern stalwart Richmond has felt the new wind : William_Styron mentions in his latest novel an avenue named for Bankhead_McGruder , a Civil_War general , now renamed , in typical California fashion ,  Buena_Vista_Terrace .
   The effects of television and other mass_media are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force.
   As for progress , the  backward South  can boast of Baton_Rouge , which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred and sixty-two percent , to 126000 , the second largest growth of the period for all cities over 25000.
     The field , then , is ripe for new Southerners to step_to_the_fore and write_of this twentieth-century phenomenon , the Southern_Yankeefication : the new urban economy , the city-dweller , the pains of transition , the labor problems ; the list is , obviously , endless.
   But these sources have not been tapped.
   Truman_Capote is still reveling in Southern_Gothicism , exaggerating the old Southern legends into something beautiful and grotesque , but as unreal as - or even more unreal than - yesterday.
   William_Styron , while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance , insists he is not to be classified as a Southern writer and yet includes traditional Southern concepts in everything he publishes.
   Even the great god Faulkner , the South 's one probable contender for literary immortality , has little concerned himself with these matters ; such are simply not within his bounded province.
     Where are the writers to treat these changes?
   Has the agrarian tradition become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded or unwanted?
   Perhaps present writers hypnotically cling_to the older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated testings over the decades.
   Lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to write_of a new economy , these writers seem to be contenting themselves with an old one that is now as defunct as Confederate money.
     An example of the changes which have crept over the Southern region may be seen in the Southern_Negro 's quest for a position in the white-dominated society , a problem that has been reflected in regional fiction especially since 1865.
   Today the Negro must discover his role in an industrialized South , which indicates that the racial aspect of the Southern dilemma has n't changed radically , but rather has gradually come to be reflected in_this new context , this new coat_of_paint.
   The Negro faces as much , if_not more , difficulty in fitting himself into an urban economy as he did_in an agrarian one.
   This represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem.
   But there have been abrupt_changes as_well : the sit-ins , the picket_lines , the bus strikes - all_of these were unheard-of even ten years ago.
   Today 's evidence , such_as the fact that only three Southern states ( South_Carolina , Alabama and Mississippi ) still openly defy integration , would have astounded many_of yesterday 's Southerners into speechlessness.
     Other examples of gradual changes that have affected the Negro have been his moving up , row by row , in the busses ; his requesting , and often getting , higher wages , better working conditions , better schools - changes that were slowly emerging even before the Supreme_Court decision of 1954.
   Then came this decision , which sped the process of gaining equality ( or perhaps hindered it ; only historical evolution will determine which ) :   an abrupt_change.
     Since 1954 the Negro 's desire for social justice has led to an ironically anarchical rebellion.
   He has frequently refused to move from white lunch counters , refused to obey local laws which he considers unjust , while in other cases he has appealed_to federal laws.
   This bold self-assertion , after decades of humble subservience , is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon , an abrupt_change in the Southern way of existence.
   A new order is thrusting itself into being.
   A new South is emerging after the post-bellum years of hesitation , uncertainty , and lack of action from the Negro in defining his new role in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations of the white_man.
     The modern Negro has not made a decisive debut into Southern fiction.
   It is clear that , while most writers enjoy picturing the Negro as a woolly-headed , humble old agrarian who mutters  yassuhs  and  sho ' nufs  with blissful deference to his white employer ( or , in Old_South terms ,  massuh  ) , this stereotype is doomed to become in_reality as obsolete as Caldwell 's Lester.
   While there may still be many Faulknerian Lucas Beauchamps scattered through the rural South , such men appear to be a vanishing breed.
   Writers openly admit that the Negro is easier to write than the white_man ; but they obviously mean by this , not a Negro personality , but a Negro type.
   Presenting an individualized Negro character , it would seem , is one of the_most difficult assignments a Southern writer could tackle ; and the success of such an endeavor is , as suggested above , glaringly rare.
     Just_as the Negro situation points_up the gradual and abrupt_changes affecting Southern life , it also points_up the non-representation of urbanism in Southern literature.
   The book concerned with the Negro 's role in an urban society is rare indeed ; recently only Keith_Wheeler 's novel , Peaceable_Lane , has openly faced the problem.
     All_but the_most rabid of Confederate_flag wavers admit that the Old_Southern tradition is defunct in actuality and sigh that its passing was_accompanied_by the disappearance of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid ante-bellum way_of_life.
   Many earlier writers , mourning the demise of the old order , tended to romanticize and exaggerate this  gracious Old_South  imagery , creating such lasting impressions as Margaret_Mitchell 's  Tara  plantation.
   Modern writers , who are supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects , insist upon drawing_out this legend , prolonging its burial , when it well deserves a rest after the overexploitation of the past century.
   Perhaps these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing ; but they can hardly deny that , exaggerated or not , the old panorama is dead.
   As John_T._Westbrook says in his article ,  Twilight of Southern_Regionalism  ( Southwest_Review , Winter 1957 ) :  The miasmal mausoleum where an Old_South , already too minutely autopsied in prose and poetry , should be_left to rest in peace , forever dead and ( let us fervently hope ) forever done_with .
     Westbrook further bemoans the Southern writers ' creation of an unreal image of their homeland , which is too readily assimilated by both foreign readers and visiting Yankees :  Our northerner is suspicious of all this crass evidence [ of urbanization ] presented to his senses.
   It bewilders and befuddles him.
   He is too deeply steeped in William_Faulkner and Robert_Penn_Warren.
   The fumes of progress are in his nose and the bright steel of industry towers before his eyes , but his heart is away in Yoknapatawpha_County with razorback_hogs and night_riders.
   On this trip to_the_South he wants , above_all else , to sniff the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at_least one barn burn at midnight .
   Obviously , such a Northern tourist 's purpose is somewhat akin to a child 's experience with Disneyland : he wants to see a world of make-believe.
     In_the_meantime , while the South has been undergoing this phenomenal modernization that is so disappointing to the curious Yankee , Southern writers have certainly done little to reflect and promote their region 's progress.
   Willard_Thorp , in his new book American Writing in the Twentieth_Century , observes , quite validly it seems :    Certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touched.
   No southern novelist has done for Atlanta or Birmingham what Herrick , Dreiser , and Farrell did for Chicago or Dos_Passos did for New_York.
   There are almost_no fictional treatments of the industrialized south .
   Not a single Southern author , major or minor , has made the urban problems of an urban South his primary source material.
     Faulkner , for one , appears to be safe from the accusing fingers of all assailants in_this regard.
   Faulkner culminates the Southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it has ever been , or could ever be , done.
   He has made it his , and his it remains , irrevocably.
   He treats it with a mythological , universal application.
     As his disciples boast , even_though his emphasis is elsewhere , Faulkner does show his awareness of the changing order of the South quite keenly , as can be proven by a quick recalling of his Sartoris and Snopes families.
   Even two decades ago in Go_Down , Moses_Faulkner was looking_to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through its youth and its new way_of_life the South might be reborn and the curse of slavery erased from its soil.
   Yet his concern even here is with a slowly changing socio-economic order in_general , and he never deals with such specific aspects of_this change as the urban and industrial impact.
     Faulkner traces , in his vast and overpowering saga of Yoknapatawpha_County , the gradual changes which seep into the South , building layer upon layer of minute , subtle innovation which eventually tend largely to hide the Old Way.
   Thus Faulkner reminds us , and wisely , that the  new  South has gradually evolved out of the Old_South , and consequently its agrarian roots persist.
   Yet he presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers if_not himself : the problems with which a New_South must grapple in groping through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization.
   With new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of six men : a machine stands between the agrarian and his soil.
   The thousands of city migrants who desert the farms yearly must readjust with even greater stress and tension : the sacred wilderness is gradually surrendering to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas.
    
    Another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual devices of the theatre.
   Most avant-garde creators , true_to their interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement , have tended to dress their dancers in simple lines and solid colors ( often black ) and to give them a bare cyclorama for a setting.
   But Robert_Rauschenberg , the neo-dadaist artist , has collaborated with several of them.
   He has designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white for Mr._Cunningham 's Summerspace , so_that dancers and background merge into a shimmering unity.
   For Mr._Taylor 's Images and Reflections he made some diaphanous tents that alternately hide and reveal the performer , and a girl 's cape lined with grass.
   Mr._Nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor.
   In_fact , he calls his productions dance-theatre works of motion , shape , light , and sound.
   To raise the dancer out of his personal , pedestrian self , Mr._Nikolais has experimented with relating him to a larger , environmental orbit.
   He began with masks to make the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be.
   He went_on to use objects - hoops , poles , capes - which he employed as extensions of the body of the dancer , who moved with them.
   The depersonalization continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play of lights upon his figure.
   In each case , the object , the color , even the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become part of the theatrical being of the performer.
   The dancer who never loosens her hold on a parasol , begins to feel that it is part of herself.
   Or , clad from_head_to_toe in fabric stretched over a series of hoops , the performer may well lose his sense of self in being a  finial .
   As the dancer is depersonalized , his accouterments are animized , and the combined elements give_birth_to a new being.
   From this being come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single unit.
     Thus , the avant-garde choreographers have extended the scope of materials available for dance composition.
   But , since they have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity , how are they to unify the impressive array of materials at their disposal?
   Some look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply corresponding methods to their own work.
   Others , less consciously but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times , experiment with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet , painter , and musician.
     An approach that has appealed to some choreographers is reminiscent_of Charles_Olson 's statement of the process of projective verse :  one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception .
   The creator trusts his intuition to lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors the reality of his experience.
   He disdains external restrictions - conventional syntax , traditional metre.
   The unit of form is determined subjectively :  the Heart , by_the_way of the Breath , to the Line .
   The test of form is fidelity to the experience , a gauge also accepted by the abstract expressionist painters.
     An earlier but still influential school of painting , surrealism , had suggested the way of dealing with the dream experience , that event in_which seemingly incongruous objects are linked together through the curious associations of the subconscious.
   The resulting picture might appear a maze of restless confusions and contradictions , but it is more true_to_life than a portrait of an artificially contrived order.
   The contemporary painter tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines , colors , masses , and energies.
   He is still concerned , however , with a personal event.
   He accepts the accidents of his brushwork because they provide evidence of the vitality of the experience of creation.
   The work must be true_to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience.
     Some painters have less interest in the experience of the moment , with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities , than in looking beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher , more serene level of truth.
   Rather_than putting their trust in ephemeral sensations they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design , which symbolize an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world.
   The concept remains subjective.
   But in_this approach it is the artist 's ultimate insight , rather_than his immediate impressions , that gives form to the work.
     Others look_to more objective devices of order.
   The musician employing the serial technique of composition establishes a mathematical system of rotations that , once set_in_motion , determines the sequence of pitches and even of rhythms and intensities.
   The composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of intervals ( or rhythms or dynamic changes ).
   He may even alter the pattern by applying a scheme of random numbers.
   But he cannot order his elements by will , either rational or inspired.
   The system works as an impersonal mechanism.
   Musicians who use the chance method also exclude subjective control of formal development.
   Again , the composer must select his own materials.
   But a tossing of coins , with perhaps the added safeguard of reference_to the oracles of the I Ching , the Chinese Book of Changes , dictates the handling of the chosen materials.
     Avant-garde choreographers , seeking new forms of continuity for their new vocabulary of movements , have turned_to similar approaches.
   Some let dances take their form from the experience of creation.
   According to Katherine_Litz ,  the becoming , the process of realization , is the dance .
   The process stipulates that the choreographer sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it.
   The sequence may involve a sharp contrast :   for_example , a quiet meditative sway of the body succeeded by a violent leap ; or it may involve more subtle distinctions :   the sway may be gradually minimized or enlarged , its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified , or it may be transferred to become a movement of only the arms or the head.
   Even the_least alteration will change the quality.
   An exploration of these possible relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form to the dance.
     The approach to the depiction of the experience of creation may be analytic , as it is for Miss_Litz , or spontaneous , as it is for Merle_Marsicano.
   She , too , is concerned with  the becoming , the process of realization  , but she does not think in_terms_of subtle variations of spatial or temporal patterns.
   The design is determined emotionally :  I must reach into myself for the spring that will send me catapulting recklessly into the chaos of event with which the dance confronts me .
   Looking_back , Miss_Marsicano feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of Jackson_Pollock.
   At_one_time she felt impelled to make dances that  moved all_over the stage  , much_as Pollock 's paintings move_violently over the full extent of the canvas.
   But her conscious need was to break_away from constricting patterns of form , a need to let the experience shape itself.
     Midi_Garth also believes in subjective continuity that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement.
   It may be a free front-back swing of the leg , leading to a sideways swing of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking_off from the ground.
   This became a dance called Prelude to Flight.
   A pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close_to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus.
     Alwin_Nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal emotion.
   He seeks to make his dancers more  godlike  by relating them to the impersonal elements of shape , light color , and sound.
   If his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures from Mars , this is consistent_with his intention of placing them in the orbit of another world , a world in_which they are freed of their pedestrian identities.
   It is through the metamorphosed dancer that the germ of form is discovered.
   In his recognition of his impersonal self the dancer moves , and this self , in the  first revealed stroke of its existence  , states the theme from which all else must follow.
   The theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve.
   It may be a reaction to a percussive sound , the following movements constituting further reactions.
   It may establish the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and color , in_which case changes in the light or color will set_off a kaleidescope of visual designs.
   Unconcerned with the practical function of his actions , the dancer is engrossed exclusively in their  motional content .
   Movements unfold freely because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive.
   But the metamorphosis must come first.
     Though he is also concerned with freeing dance from pedestrian modes of activity , Merce_Cunningham has selected a very different method for achieving his aim.
   He rejects all subjectively motivated continuity , any line of action related to the concept of cause and effect.
   He bases his approach on the belief that anything can follow anything.
   An order can be chanced rather_than chosen , and this approach produces an experience that is  free and discovered rather_than bound and remembered .
   Thus , there is freshness not_only in the individual movements of the dance but in the shape of their continuity as_well.
   Chance , he finds , enables him to create  a world beyond imagination .
   He cites with pleasure the comment of a lady , who exclaimed after a concert :  Why , it 's extremely interesting.
   But I would never have thought_of it myself .
     The sequence of movements in a Cunningham dance is unlike any sequence to be seen in life.
   At one side of the stage a dancer jumps excitedly ; nearby , another sits motionless , while still another is twirling an umbrella.
   A man and a girl happen to meet ; they look straight at the audience , not at each other.
   He lifts her , puts her down , and walks off , neither pleased nor disturbed , as if nothing had happened.
   If one dancer slaps another , the victim may do a pirouette , sit_down , or offer his assailant a fork and spoon.
   Events occur without apparent reason.
   Their consequences are irrelevant - or there are no consequences at_all.
     The sequence is determined by_chance , and Mr._Cunningham makes use of any one of several chance devices.
   He may toss coins ; he may take slips_of_paper from a grab bag.
   The answers derived by these means may determine not_only the temporal organization of the dance but also its spatial design , special slips designating the location on_the_stage where the movement is to be_performed.
   The other variables include the dancer who is to perform the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance.
   The only factors that are personally set by the choreographer are the movements themselves , the number of the dancers , and the approximate total duration of the dance.
   The  approximate  is important , because even after the order of the work has been established by the chance method , the result is not inviolable.
   Each performance may be different.
   If a work is divided into several large segments , a last-minute drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the segments for any particular performance.
   And any sequence can not_only change its positions in the work but can even be eliminated from_it altogether.
     Mr._Cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method ; he adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can.
   However , there is always the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible to execute.
   Then the choreographer must arbitrate.
   He must rearrange matters so_that two performers do not bump_into each other.
   He must construct transitions so_that a dancer who is told to lie prone one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation for the leap.
    
    The North and the South were in greater agreement on sovereignty , through all their dispute about it , than were the Founding Fathers.
   The truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen of the calibre of Webster and Calhoun , and defended in_the_end by leaders of the nobility of Lincoln and Lee.
   The people everywhere had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles , in understanding of and belief in the federal balance , and in_love of their Union.
   Repeated efforts - beginning_with the Missouri_Compromise of 1821 - were made by such master moderates as Clay and Douglas to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise , rather_than clear thought and timely action.
   Even_so , confusion in_this period gained such strength ( from compromise and other factors ) that it led to the bloodiest war of the Nineteenth century.
   Nothing can show more_than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies_in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty.
     The present issue in Atlantica - whether to transform an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens - resembles the American one of 1787 - 89 rather_than the one that was resolved by Civil_War.
   And so I would only touch upon it now ( much_as I have long wanted to write a book about it ).
   I think it is essential , however , to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts of sovereignty that went_to_war in 1861 - if only to see better how imperative is our need today to clarify completely our far worse confusion on this subject.
     The difference came_down to this : The Southern States insisted that the United_States was , in last analysis , what its name implied - a Union of States.
   To their leaders the Constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign states , who therefore retained the right to secede from_it.
   This right of the State , its upholders contended , was essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of centralizing power in the Union government.
   The champions of the Union maintained that the Constitution had formed , fundamentally , the united people of America , that it was a compact among sovereign citizens rather_than states , and that therefore the states had no right to secede , though the citizens could.
   Writing to Speed on August 24 , 1855 , Lincoln made the latter point clear.
   In homely terms whose timeliness is startling today , he thus declared his own right to secede.
    We began by declaring that all men are created equal.
   We now practically read it , all men are created equal except negroes.
   When the Know-nothings get control , it will read , All men are created equal except negroes and foreigners and Catholics.
   When it comes to this , I shall prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty - to Russia , for_instance , where despotism can be taken pure , without the base alloy of hypocrisy .
   [ His emphasis ]     When the Southern States exercised their  right to secede  , they formed what they officially styled  The Confederate_States_of_America .
   Dictionaries , as we have seen , still cite this government , along with the Articles of Confederation of 1781 , as an example of a confederacy.
   The fact is that the Southern_Confederacy differed from the earlier one almost as much_as the Federal_Constitution did.
   The Confederate_Constitution copied much of the Federal_Constitution verbatim , and most_of the rest in substance.
   It operated on , by and for the people individually just_as did the Federal_Constitution.
   It made substantially the same division of power between the central and state_governments , and among the executive , legislative and judicial branches.
     Many believe - and understandably - that the great difference between the Constitution of the Southern_Confederacy and the Federal_Constitution was that the former recognized the right of each state to secede.
   But though each of its members had asserted this right against the Union , the final Constitution which the Confederacy signed on March 11 - nearly a month before hostilities began - included no explicit provision authorizing a state to secede.
   Its drafters discussed this vital point but left it out of their Constitution.
   Their President , Jefferson_Davis , interpreted their Constitution to mean that it  admits of no coerced association  , but this remained so doubtful that  there were frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the Constitution .
     The Constitution of the Southern  Confederation  differed from_that of the Federal_Union only in two important respects : It openly , defiantly , recognized slavery - an institution which the Southerners of 1787 , even_though they continued it , found so impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning the word in the Federal_Constitution.
   They recognized that slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest , and that to recognize it explicitly in their Constitution would be in explosive contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set_forth in the Declaration of 1776 that  all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights , that among them are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
   The other important difference between the two Constitutions was that the President of the Confederacy held office for six ( instead of four ) years , and was limited to one term.
     These are not , however , differences in federal structure.
   The only important differences from_that standpoint , between the two Constitutions , lies_in their Preambles.
   The one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people were acting through their states , whereas the Preamble of 1787 - 89 expressed , as clearly as language can , the opposite concept , that they were acting directly as citizens.
   Here are the two Preambles :      we the People of the United_States , in_order_to form a more perfect Union , establish Justice , insure domestic Tranquility , provide_for the common Defence , promote the general Welfare , and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity , do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United_States_of_America .
      We the people of the Confederate States , each state acting in its sovereign and independent character , in_order_to form a permanent federal_government , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity - invoking the favor and the guidance of Almighty_God - do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederate_States_of_America .
     One is tempted to say that , on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two preambles , the worst war of the Nineteenth century was fought.
   But though the Southern States , when drafting a constitution to unite themselves , narrowed the difference to this fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede , the fact remained that by seceding from the Union they had already acted_on the concept that it was composed primarily of sovereign states.
   If the Union conceded this to them , the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede : This would destroy the federal balance between it and the states , and in_the_end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their Union.
     Lincoln saw that the act of secession made the issue for the Union a vital one : Whether it was a Union of sovereign citizens that should continue to live , or an association of sovereign states that must fall prey either to  anarchy or despotism .
     Much_as he abhorred slavery , Lincoln was always willing to concede to each  slave_state  the right to decide independently whether to continue or end it.
   Though his election was interpreted by many Southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal balance in favor of the Union , Lincoln himself proposed no such change in the rights the Constitution gave the states.
   After the war began , he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by Union action even in the Border States that stayed with the Union.
   He issued his Emancipation_Proclamation only when he felt that necessity left him no other way to save the Union.
   In his Message of December 2 , 1862 , he put his purpose and his policy in these words - which I would call the Lincoln_Law of Liberty-and-Union :  In giving freedom to the slave , we assure freedom to the free .
     What Lincoln could not concede was that the states rather_than the people were sovereign in the Union.
   He fought to the end to preserve it as a  government of the people , by the people , for the people .
     The fact that the Americans who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in_order_to keep many_of their people more securely in slavery - the antithesis of individual liberty - made the conflict grimmer , and the greater.
   Out of_this ordeal the citizen emerged , in the South as in_the_North , as America 's true sovereign , in  a new birth of freedom  , as Lincoln promised.
   But before_this came_about , 214938 Americans had given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights of men and of states.
     On their decisive battlefield Lincoln did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the  brave men , living and dead , who fought here .
   He understood that both sides were at_fault , and he reached the height of saying so explicitly in his Second Inaugural.
     To my knowledge , Lincoln remains the only Head_of_State and Commander-in-Chief who , while fighting a fearful war whose issue was in doubt , proved man enough to say this publicly - to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in_all human truth there is some error , and in_all our error , some truth.
   So great a man could not but understand , too , that the thing that moves men to sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought , which their opponents see and attack , but the truth which the latter do not see - any_more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves defend.
     It is much less difficult now than in Lincoln 's day to see that on both sides sovereign Americans had given their lives in the Civil_War to maintain the balance between the powers they had delegated to the States and to their Union.
   They differed in the balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen - but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental truth : That individual life , liberty and happiness depend_on a right balance between the two - and on the limitation of sovereignty , in_all its aspects , which this involves.
   The 140414 Americans who gave  the last full measure of devotion  to prevent disunion , preserved individual freedom in the United_States from the dangers of anarchy , inherent in confederations , which throughout_history have proved fatal in_the_end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign states , and to the liberties of their people.
   But the fact that 70524 other Americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing concept served Liberty-and-Union in other essential ways.
     Its appeal from ballots to bullets at Fort_Sumter ended by costing the Southerners their right to have slaves - a right that was even_less compatible with the sovereignty of man.
   The very fact that they came so near to winning by the wrong method , war , led directly to their losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for , since it forced Lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure.
   There was a divine justice in one wrong thus undoing another.
   There was also a lesson , one that has served ever since to keep Americans , in their conflicts with one another , from turning from the ballot to the bullet.
   Yet though the Southern States lost the worst errors in their case , they did not lose the truth they fought for.
   The lives so many_of them gave , to forestall what they believed would be a fatal encroachment by the Union on the powers reserved to their states have continued ever since to safeguard all Americans against freedom 's other foe.
    
    Even Hemingway , for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms never maintained that sex was all.
   Hemingway 's fiction is supported by a  moral  backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at a religious dimension.
   And D._H._Lawrence , in Fantasia of the Unconscious , protested vehemently against the overestimation of the sexual motive.
   Though sex in some form or other enters into all human_activity and it was a good thing that Freud emphasized this aspect of human nature , it is fantastic to explain everything in_terms_of sex.
    All is not sex  , declared Lawrence.
   Man is not confined to one outlet for his vital energy.
   The creative urge , for_example , transcends the body and the self.
     But for the beat_generation all is sex.
   Nothing is more revealing of the way_of_life and literary aspirations of_this group than their attitude toward sex.
   For the beatnik , like the hipster , is in_opposition to a society that is based on the repression of the sex instinct.
   He has elevated sex - not Eros or libido but pure , spontaneous , uninhibited sex - to the rank of the godhead ; it is Astarte , Ishtar , Venus , Yahwe , Dionysus , Christ , the mysterious and divine orgone energy flowing through the body of the universe.
   Jazz is sex , marijuana is a stimulus to sex , the beat tempo is adjusted to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse.
   Lawrence_Lipton , in The Holy_Barbarians , stresses that for the beat_generation sex is more_than a source of pleasure ; it is a mystique , and their private language is rich_in the multivalent ambiguities of sexual reference so_that they dwell in a sexualized universe_of_discourse.
   The singular uncompromising force of their revolt against the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal to dance in a public place.
   The dance is but a disguised ritual for the expression of ungratified sexual_desire.
   For this reason , too , their language is more forthright and earthy.
   The beatniks crave a sexual experience in_which their whole being participates.
     It is therefore not surprising that they resist the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity , for like cats they are determined not to tame their sexual energy.
   They withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy the precepts of legalized propriety.
   Unlike the heroes and flappers of the lost generation , they disdain the art of  necking  and  petting .
   That is reserved for the squares.
   If they avoid the use of the pungent , outlawed four-letter word it is because it is taboo ; it is sacred.
   As Lipton , the prophet of the beat_generation , declares :  In the sexual act , the beat are filled with mana , the divine power.
   This is far from the vulgar , leering sexuality of the middle-class square in heat .
   This is the Holy_Grail these knights of the orgasm pursue , this is the irresistible cosmic urge to_which they respond.
     If Wilhelm_Reich is the Moses who has led them out of the Egypt of sexual slavery , Dylan_Thomas is the poet who offers them the Dionysian dialectic of justification for their indulgence in liquor , marijuana , sex , and jazz.
   In_addition , they have been converted to Zen_Buddhism , with its glorification of all that is  natural  and mysteriously alive , the sense that everything in the world is flowing.
   Thus , paradoxically , the beat writers resort to  religious  metaphors : they are in search of mana , the spiritual , the numinous , but not anything connected with formal religion.
   What they are_after is the beatific vision.
   And Zen_Buddhism , though it is extremely difficult to understand how these internal contradictions are reconciled , helps them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through sexual release.
     The style of life chosen by the beat_generation , the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as uniquely their own , is designed to enhance the value of the sexual experience.
   Jazz is good not_only because it promotes wholeness but because of its decided sexual effect.
   Jazz is the musical language of sex , the vocabulary of the orgasm ; indeed , it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz , by freeing the listener of his inhibitions , can have therapeutic value.
   That is why , the argument runs , the squares are so fearful of jazz and yet perversely fascinated by it.
   Instead of giving themselves spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them , they undergo psychoanalysis or flirt_with mysticism or turn_to prostitutes for satisfaction.
   Thus jazz is transmuted into something holy , the sacred road to integration of being.
   Jazz , like sex , is a mystique.
   It is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative impulse in unfettered man.
     The mystique of sex , combined with marijuana and jazz , is intended to provide a design for living.
   Those who are sexually liberated can become creatively alive and free , their instincts put at the service of the imagination.
   Righteous in their denunciation of all that makes_for death , the beat prophets bid all men become cool cats ; let them learn to  swing  freely , to let_go , to become authentically themselves , and_then perhaps civilization will be saved.
   The beatnik , seceding from a society that is fatally afflicted with a deathward drive , is concerned with his personal salvation in the living present.
   If he is the child of nothingness , if he is the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars , then he will consult only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil.
   He will not curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that makes him feel truly and fully alive , even if it is only for this brief moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth.
     That is why the members of the beat_generation proudly assume the title of the holy barbarians ; they will destroy the shrines , temples , museums , and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the life they believe_in.
   Apart from the categorical_imperative they derive from the metaphysics of the orgasm , the only affirmation they are capable_of making is that art is their only refuge.
   Their writing , born of their experiments in marijuana and untrammeled sexuality , reflects the extremity of their existential alienation.
   The mind has betrayed them , reason is the foe of life ; they will trust only their physical sensations , the wisdom of the body , the holy promptings of the unconscious.
   With lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate , but their faith in_love , inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz , culminates in the climax of the orgasm.
   Their work mirrors the mentality of the psychopath , rootless and irresponsible.
   Their rebellion against authoritarian society is not far removed from the violence of revolt characteristic of the juvenile_delinquent.
     And the life they lead is undisciplined and for_the_most_part unproductive , even_though they make a fetish of devoting themselves to some creative pursuit - writing , painting , music.
   They are non-conformists on principle.
   When they express themselves it is incandescent hatred that shines forth , the rage of repudiation , the ecstasy of negation.
   It is sex that obsesses them , sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed.
   What they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to_which sex can inspire the Muse.
   Monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful middle_class continue to suffer , whereas the beatnik has the courage to break_out of_that prison of respectability.
   One girl describes her past , her succession of broken marriages , the abortions she has had and finally confesses that she loves sex and sees no reason why she must justify her passion.
   If it is an honest feeling , then why should she not yield to it?
    Most often  , she says ,  it 's the monogamous relationship that is dishonest .
   There is nothing holy in wedlock.
   This girl soon drops the bourgeois pyschiatrist who disapproves of her life.
   She finds married life stifling and every prolonged sex relationship unbearably monotonous.
     This confession serves to make clear in_part what is behind this sexual revolution : the craving for sensation for its own sake , the need for change , for new experiences.
   Boredom is death.
   In the realm of physical sensations , sex reigns supreme.
   Hence the beatniks sustain themselves on marijuana , jazz , free swinging poetry , exhausting themselves in orgies of sex ; some of them are driven over the borderline of sanity and lose contact with reality.
   One beat poet composes a poem ,  Lines on a Tijuana_John  , which contains a_few happy hints for survival.
   The new fact the initiates of_this cult have_to learn is that they must move toward simplicity.
   The professed mission of_this disaffiliated generation is to find a new way_of_life which they can express in poetry and fiction , but what they produce is unfortunately disordered , nourished solely on the hysteria of negation.
     Who are the creative representatives of_this movement?
   Nymphomaniacs , junkies , homosexuals , drug_addicts , lesbians , alcoholics , the weak , the frustrated , the irresolute , the despairing , the derelicts and outcasts of society.
   They embrace independent poverty , usually with a  shack-up  partner who will help support them.
   They are full of contempt for the institution of matrimony.
   Their previous legalized marriages do not count , for they hold the laws of the state null and void.
   They feel they are leagued against a hostile , persecutory world , faced with the concerted malevolent opposition of squares and their hirelings , the police.
   This is the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defending their way_of_life , their search for wholeness , though their actual existence fails to reach these  religious  heights.
   One beatnik got the woman he was living with so involved in drugs and self-analysis and all-night sessions of sex that she was beginning to crack_up.
   What obsessions had she picked_up during these long nights of talk?
   Sex as the creative principle of the universe , the secret of primitive religion , the life of myth.
   Everything in_the_final_analysis reduced itself to sexual symbolism.
   In his chapter on  The Loveways of the Beat_Generation  , Lipton spares the reader none of the sordid details.
   No one asks questions about the free union of the sexes in West_Venice so_long as the partners share the negative attitudes of the group.
     The women who come to West_Venice , having forsaken radicalism , are interested in living only for_the_moment , in being constantly on_the_move.
   Others who are attracted to this Mecca of the beat_generation are homosexuals , heroin_addicts , and smalltime hoodlums.
   Those who are sexual deviants are naturally drawn to join the beatniks.
   Since the homosexuals widely use marijuana , they do not have_to be initiated.
   Part of the ritual of sex is the use of marijuana.
   As Lipton puts it :  The Eros is felt in the magic circle of marijuana with far greater force , as a unifying principle in human relationships , than at any other time except , perhaps , in the mutual metaphysical orgasms.
   The magic circle is , in_fact , a symbol of and preparation for the metaphysical orgasm .
   Under the influence of marijuana the beatnik comes_alive within and experiences a wonderfully enhanced sense of self as if he had discovered the open_sesame to the universe of being.
   Carried high on this  charge  , he composes  magical  poetry that captures the organic rhythms of life in words.
   If he thus achieves a lyrical , dreamlike , drugged intensity , he pays the price for his indulgence by producing work - Allen_Ginsberg 's  Howl  is a striking example of_this tendency - that is disoriented , Dionysian but without depth and without Apollonian control.
   For drugs are in themselves no royal_road to creativity.
   How is the beat poet to achieve unity of form when he is at_the_same_time engaged in a systematic derangement of senses.
     If love reflects the nature of man , as Ortega_y_Gasset believes , if the person in_love betrays decisively what he is by his behavior in_love , then the writers of the beat_generation are creating a new literary genre.
    
    In most_of the less developed countries , however , such programing is at_best inadequate and at_worst nonexistent.
   Only a very_few of the more advanced ones , such_as India and Pakistan , have developed systematic techniques of programing.
     Others have so-called development plans , but some of these are little more_than lists of projects collected from various ministries while others are statements of goals without analysis of the actions required to attain them.
   Only rarely is attention given to accurate progress_reports and evaluation.
     Neither growth nor a development program can be imposed on a country ; it must express the nation 's own will and goal.
   Nevertheless , we can administer an aid program in such a manner as to promote the development of responsible programing.
     First , we can encourage responsibility by establishing as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the definition of objectives and the assessment of costs.
     Second , we can make assistance for particular projects conditional on the consistency of such projects with the program.
     Third , we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development which are adapted to the country 's objectives and resources.
   This includes assistance in - assembling the basic economic , financial , technological , and educational information on_which programing depends ; surveying the needs and requirements over time of broad sectors of the economy , such_as transport , agriculture , communication , industry , and power ; designing the financial mechanisms of the economy in ways that will promote growth without inflation ; and administrative practices which will make possible the more effective review and implementation of programs once established.
     The application of conditions in the allocation of aid funds cannot , of_course , be mechanical.
   It must be recognized that countries at different stages of development have very different capabilities of meeting such conditions.
   To insist on a_level of performance in programing and budgeting completely beyond the capabilities of the recipient country would result in the frustration of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage more rapid_growth.
     In the more primitive areas , where the capacity to absorb and utilize external assistance is limited , some activities may be of such obvious priority that we may decide to support them before a well worked_out program is available.
   Thus , we might provide limited assistance in such fields as education , essential transport , communications , and agricultural improvement despite the absence of acceptable country programs.
   In such a case , however , we would encourage the recipient country to get_on with its programing task , supply it with substantial technical assistance in performing that task , and make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of our assistance to the country 's development was conditional upon programing progress being made.
     At the other end of the spectrum , where the more advanced countries can be relied_upon to make well thought through decisions as to project priorities within a consistent program , we should be prepared to depart substantially from detailed project approval as the basis for granting assistance and to move toward long-term support , in_cooperation with other developed countries , of the essential foreign_exchange requirements of the country 's development program.
     A systematic approach to development budgeting and programing is one important kind_of self-help.
   There are many others.
   It is vitally important that the new U._S. aid program should encourage all_of them , since the main thrust for development must come from the less developed countries themselves.
   External aid can only be marginal , although the margin , as in the case of the Marshall plan , can be decisive.
   External aid can be effective only if it is a complement to self-help.
   U._S. aid , therefore , should increasingly be designed to provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves can take.
     In establishing conditions of self-help , it is important that we not expect countries to remake themselves in our image.
   Open societies can take many forms , and within very broad limits recipients must be free to set their own goals and to devise their own institutions to achieve those goals.
   On_the_other_hand , it is no interference with sovereignty to point_out defects where they exist , such_as that a plan calls_for factories without power to run them , or for institutions without trained personnel to staff them.
   Once we have made clear that we are genuinely concerned with a country 's development potential , we can be blunt in suggesting the technical conditions that must be met for development to occur.
     The major areas of self-help are the following :     This includes not_only development programing , but also establishing tax_policies designed to raise equitably resources for investment ; fiscal and monetary policies designed to prevent serious inflation ; and regulatory policies aimed to attract the financial and managerial resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury consumption by a_few.
     This includes foreseeing balance-of-payments crises , with adequate attention to reducing dependence on imports and adopting realistic exchange_rates to encourage infant industries and spur exports.
   It also includes providing_for the training of nationals to operate projects after they are completed.
     For both economic and political reasons all segments of the population must be able to share_in the growth of a country.
   Otherwise , development will not lead to longrun stability.
     In many societies , what we regard_as corruption , favoritism , and personal influence are so accepted as consistent_with the mores of officialdom and so integral a part of routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their elimination will be regarded by the local leadership as not_only unwarranted but unfriendly.
   Yet an economy cannot get the_most out of its resources if dishonesty , corruption , and favoritism are widespread.
   Moreover , tolerance by us of such practices results in serious waste and diversion of aid resources and in_the_long_run generates anti-American sentiment of a kind peculiarly damaging to our political interest.
   Some of the_most dramatic successes of communism in winning local support can be traced to the identification - correct or not - of Communist regimes with personal honesty and pro-Western regimes with corruption.
   A requirement of reasonably honest administration may be politically uncomfortable in the short run , but it is politically essential in_the_long_run.
     The United_States can use its aid as an incentive to self-help by responding with aid on a sustained basis , tailored to priority needs , to those countries making serious efforts in self-help.
     In many instances it can withhold or limit its aid to countries not_yet willing to make such efforts.
     There are other countries where , with skillful diplomacy , we may be able by our aid to give encouragement to those groups in government which would like to press forward with economic and social reform measures to promote growth.
   Governments are rarely monolithic.
     But there will be still other countries where , despite the inadequacy of the level of self-help , we shall deem it wise , for political or military reasons , to give substantial economic assistance.
   Even in these cases we should promote self-help by making it clear that our supporting assistance is subject to reduction and ultimately to termination.
     The_most fundamental concept of the new approach to economic aid is the focusing of our attention , our resources , and our energies on the effort to promote the economic and social development of the less developed countries.
   This is not a short-run goal.
   To have any success in_this effort , we must ourselves view it as an enterprise stretching over a considerable number of years , and we must encourage the recipients of our aid to view it in the same fashion.
     How long it will take to show substantial success in_this effort will vary greatly from country to country.
   In several significant cases , such_as India , a decade of concentrated effort can launch these countries into a stage in_which they can carry forward their own economic and social progress with little or no government-to-government assistance.
   These cases in_which light is already visible at the other end of the tunnel are ones which over the next few years will absorb the bulk of our capital assistance.
     The number of countries thus favorably situated is small , but their peoples constitute over half of the population of the underdeveloped world.
   Meantime , over the decade of the sixties , we can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big push into self-sustaining growth.
   In still others which are barely on the threshold of the transition into modernity , the decade can bring significant progress in launching the slow process of developing their human resources and their basic services to_the_point where an expanded range of developmental activities is possible.
     The whole program must be conceived_of as an effort , stretching over a considerable number of years , to alter the basic social and economic_conditions in the less developed world.
   It must be recognized as a slow-acting tool designed to prevent political and military crises such_as those recently confronted in Laos and Cuba.
   It is not a tool for dealing with these crises after they have erupted.
     Many_of the individual projects for which development assistance is required call_for expenditures over lengthy periods.
   Dams , river development schemes , transportation networks , educational systems require years to construct.
   Moreover , on complex projects , design work must be completed and orders for machinery and equipment placed months or even years before construction can commence.
   Thus , as a development program is being launched , commitments and obligations must be entered into in a given year which may exceed by twofold or threefold the expenditures to be made in_that year.
   The capital expansion programs of business_firms involve multi-year budgeting and the same is true of country development programs.
     More importantly , several of the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for at_least 5 years forward and tentatively for considerably more_than that if they are to be sure that the various interdependent activities involved are all to take_place in the proper sequence.
   Without such forward planning , investment_funds are wasted because manufacturing facilities are completed before there is power to operate them or before there is transport to service them ; or a skilled labor_force is trained before there are plants available in_which they can be employed.
     Most important of all , the less developed countries must be persuaded to take the necessary steps to allocate and commit their own resources.
   They must be induced to establish the necessary tax , fiscal , monetary , and regulatory policies.
   They must be persuaded to adopt the other necessary self-help measures which are described in the preceding section.
   The taking of these steps involves tough internal policy decisions.
   Moreover , once these steps are taken , they may require years to make themselves felt.
   They must , therefore , be related to long-range development plans.
     If the less developed countries are to be persuaded to adopt a long-term approach , the United_States , as the principal supplier of external aid , must be prepared to give long-term commitments.
   In_this , as in so many aspects of our development assistance activities , the incentive effects of the posture we take are the_most important ones.
   The extent to_which we can persuade the less developed countries to appraise their own resources , to set targets toward which they should be working , to establish in the light of_this forward perspective the_most urgent priorities for their immediate attention , and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves , all on a realistic long-term basis , will depend importantly on the incentives we place before them.
   If they feel that we are taking a long-term view of their problems and are prepared to enter into reasonably long-term association with them in their development activities , they will be much more likely to undertake the difficult tasks required.
   Perhaps the_most important incentive for them will be clear evidence that where other countries have done this kind_of home work we have responded with long-term commitments.
    
    You have heard him tell these young people that during his almost 50 years of service in the Congress he has seen the Kaisers and the Hitlers and the Mussolinis , the Tojos and Stalins and Khrushchevs , come and go and that we are passing_on to them the freest Nation that mankind has ever known.
   Then I have seen the pride of country well in the eyes of these young people.
     So , I say , Mr._Speaker , God bless you and keep you for many years not_only for this body but for the United_States_of_America and the free_world.
   You remember the words of President_Kennedy a week or_so ago , when someone asked him when he was in Canada , and Dean_Rusk was in Europe , and Vice_President Johnson was in Asia ,  Who is_running the store ?
 and he said  The Same fellow who has been_running it , Sam_Rayburn .
     Mr._Speaker , I ask unanimous consent that all Members who desire to do so may extend their remarks at this point in the Record ; and also that they may have 5 legislative days in_which to extend their remarks.
     Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?
     There was no objection.
     It is notably significant that so many Members from both sides of the aisle express their respect and admiration for our beloved Speaker , the Honorable_Sam_Rayburn.
   I purposely refrained_from adding the usual distinction of saying that he was from the State of Texas.
   I did so because I agree with so many here today , that he is the beloved Speaker of all the people of the United_States.
   For the dignity , the influence , and the power of the legislative branch of our Government - it is a privilege for us to do honor to this great man who represents not alone his own district but all the people of our country.
   To honor him is to honor ourselves.
     In_this my first year as a Member of_this body I have experienced many memorable moments.
   Many_of these experiences are so important that they will be cherished forever by me.
   And , like many_of you here present , I hold as the highlight of all , the occasion of my first meeting with the honorable Speaker of the House.
   At_that_time , he afforded me the courtesy of his busy workday for such length as I may need , to speak about my background , my hopes , my views on various national and local topics , and any problems that I may have been vexed with at_the_time.
   He was fatherly in his handling of all subjects with me and tremendously wise in his counsel.
   In_conclusion , he wished me well - and as kindly and humbly as this humane gentleman could express himself , he asked to be_remembered to my wife and children.
     In my short period here I believe that at_no_time has he been otherwise than the_most popular man on both sides of the aisle.
   He is most effective in the ordinary business of the House , and in the legislative accomplishments of_this session , he easily rose to great occasion - even at the height of unpleasantness and exciting legislative struggle - and as the Nation witnessed these contests , he rose , even as admitted by those who differed with him , to the proportions of a hero and a noble partisan.
     I am highly privileged today to commemorate the brilliant career of_this parliamentary giant.
   He will ever be my example as a true statesman ; one who is thoroughly human , who affects no dignity , and who is endowed_with real ability , genuine worth , and sterling honesty - all dedicated_to secure the best interests of the country he has loved and served so_long.
   May the Divine_Speaker in Heaven bless this country with Sam_Rayburn 's continued service here for years to come.
     It is a matter of deep personal satisfaction for me to add my voice to the great and distinguished chorus of my colleagues in_this paean of praise , respect , and affection for Speaker_Sam_Rayburn.
   In_this hour of crisis , the wisdom , the dedication , the stabilizing force that he represents in current American government is an almost indispensable source of strength.
   He has become in_this half century the grand old_man of American history.
   It seems to me that the prayers of the whole free_world must rise like some vast petition to Providence that Sam_Rayburn 's vigor and his life remain undiminished through the coming decades.
     Here briefly in_this humble tribute I have sought for some simple and succinct summation that would define the immense service of_this patriot to his country.
   But the task is beyond me because I hold it impossible to compress in a sentence or two the complicated and prodigious contributions Sam_Rayburn has made as an individual , as a legislator , as a statesman and as a leader and conciliator , to the majestic progress of_this Nation.
   It happens that I am a legislator from Ohio and that I feel deeply about the needs , the aspirations , the interests of my district and my State.
   What Sam_Rayburn 's life proves to us all is the magnificent lesson in political_science that one can devotedly and with absolute dedication represent the seemingly provincial interests of one 's own community , one 's own district , one 's own State , and by that help himself represent even better the sweep and scope of the problems of_this the greatest nation of_all_time.
     For Sam_Rayburn never forgot Bonham , his home community , and he never forgot Texas.
   In the Same way I like to think we owe our loyalty as legislators to our community , our district , our State.
   And , if we follow the Rayburn pattern , as consciously or by an instinctual political sense I like to think I have followed it , then the very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected in the devotion of our services to our country.
   For what Sam_Rayburn 's life in_this House teaches us is that loyalty and character are not divisive and there is no such thing as being for your country and neglecting your district.
   There is no such thing as being diligent about national affairs but indifferent about home needs.
   The two are as one.
   This may not be the greatest but it certainly comes_close to being the greatest lesson Sam_Rayburn 's career , up_to this hour , teaches all_of us who would aspire to distinction in political life under our processes of government.
     More_than that , Sam_Rayburn is the very living symbol of an iron-clad integrity so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count some of his best friends in the opposition.
   Through the_most rancorous battles of political controversy and the_most bitterly fought national and presidential campaigns his character shines as an example of dignity and honesty , forthrightness and nobility.
   Sam_Rayburn has never had to look_back at any of his most devastating fights and ever feel ashamed of his conduct as a combatant under_fire or his political manners in the heat of conflicting ambitions.
   This means much to the American tradition.
   It is an answer in its way , individual and highly dramatic , to the charge that the democratic process is necessarily vicious in its campaign characteristics.
   And the name Rayburn is one of the_most dominant in the history of American politics for the last half century.
     It is , I insist , hard to define the Rayburn contribution to our political civilization because it is so massive and so widespread and so complicated , and because it goes so deep.
   But this we know : Here is a great life that in every area of American politics gives the American people occasion for pride and that has invested the democratic process with the_most decent qualities of honor , decency , and self-respect.
   I pray to God that he may be spared to us for many years to come for this is an influence the United_States and the whole world can ill afford to lose.
     All_but two of my nine terms in the House_of_Representatives has been served under the Speakership of Sam_Rayburn.
   Of_this I am proud.
   I have a distinct admiration for this man we honor today because of the humility with which he carries his greatness.
     And Sam_Rayburn is a great man - one who will go_down in American history as a truly great leader of the Nation.
   He will be considered not_only great among his contemporaries , but as great among all the Americans who have played a part in the country 's history since the beginning.
     I pay my personal tribute to Sam_Rayburn , stalwart Texan and great American , not_only because today he establishes a record of having served as Speaker of the House_of_Representatives more_than twice_as long as Henry_Clay , but because of the contributions he has made to the welfare of the people of the Nation during his almost half century of service as a Member of Congress.
     Speaker_Rayburn has not limited his leadership as a statesman to his direction of the House in the Speaker 's chair.
   He had an outstanding record as a legislator since the start of his career in the House in 1913 , the 63 d Congress.
   No one has sponsored more progressive and important legislation than has Sam_Rayburn.
   He is the recognized  father  of the Rural_Electrification_Administration and the Security and Exchange_Commission.
   But to run_the_gauntlet of the programs Sam_Rayburn brought into being through his legislative efforts would fill the pages of today 's Record.
     No greater pleasure has come to me in my own service in_this House than to be present today to participate in_this tribute to this great Speaker , this great legislator , this great Texan , this great American.
     My sincere wish is that he continues to add to this record he sets here today.
     Sam_Rayburn is one of the greatest American public figures in the history of our country and I consider that I have been signally honored in the privilege of knowing Sam_Rayburn and sharing with him the rights and obligations of a Member of the House_of_Representatives in the Congress of the United_States.
     Others may speak of Speaker_Rayburn ' S uniquely long and devoted service ; of his championship of many_of the progressive social measures which adorn our statute_books today , and of his cooperation in times of adversity with Presidents of both of our major parties in helping to pilot the Ship of State through the shoals of today 's stormy international seas.
     I prefer to speak , however , of Sam_Rayburn , the person , rather_than Sam_Rayburn , the American institution.
     Although Sam_Rayburn affects a gruff exterior in many instances , nevertheless he is fundamentally a man of warm heart and gentle disposition.
   No one could be more devoted than he to the American_Congress as an institution and more aware_of its historical significance in the political history of the world , and I shall never forget his moving talks , delivered in simple yet eloquent words , upon the meaning of our jobs as Representatives in the operation of representative government and their importance in the context of today 's assault upon popular government.
     Above_all , he is a person to whom a fledgling Representative can go to discuss the personal and professional problems which inevitably confront a new Congressman.
   In_this role of father confessor , he has always been most characteristic and most helpful.
     On September 16 , Sam_Rayburn will have served as Speaker twice_as long as any predecessor and I am proud to join with others in marking this date , and in expressing my esteem for that notable American , Sam_Rayburn.
    
    The practice of state-owned vehicles for use of employees on business dates_back over forty years.
   At_least one state vehicle was in existence in 1917.
     The state presently owns 389 passenger vehicles in comparison to approximately 200 in 1940.
     The automobile maintenance unit , or motor_pool , came into existence in 1942 and has been responsible_for centralized maintenance and management of state-owned transportation since that time.
     The motor_pool has made exceptional progress in automotive management including establishment of cost billing systems , records keeping , analyses of vehicle use , and effecting economies in vehicle operation.
   Cars were operated in 1959 for an average.
027 per mile.
     Purchase of state vehicles is handled similarly to all state purchases.
   Unit prices to the state are considerably lower than to the general public because of quantity purchases and no payment of state sales or federal excise_taxes.
     The legislature 's role in policy determination concerning state-owned vehicles has been confined almost exclusively to appropriating funds for vehicles.
     The meaningful policies governing the purchase , assignment , use and management of state vehicles have been shaped by the state 's administrative officers.
     Meaningful policies include : ( a ) kinds of cars the state should own , ( b ) when cars should be traded , ( c ) the need and assignment of vehicles , ( d ) use of cars in lieu of mileage allowances , ( e ) employees taking cars home , and ( f ) need for liability insurance on state automobiles.
     A review of these policies indicates :     The state purchases and assigns grades of cars according_to_need and position status of driver and use of vehicle.
     The purchase of compact ( economy ) cars is being made currently on a test basis.
     Cars are traded mostly on a three-year basis in the interest of economy.
     The factors governing need and assignment of cars are flexible according to circumstances.
     Unsuccessful efforts have been made to replace high mileage allowances with state automobiles.
     It is reasonably economical for the state to have drivers garage state cars at their homes.
     The state has recently undertaken liability insurance for drivers of state cars.
     A survey of practices and / or policies in other states concerning assignment and use of state automobiles reveals several points for comparison with Rhode_Island 's practices.
     Forty-seven states assign or provide vehicles for employees on state business.
   Two other states provide vehicles , but only with legislative approval.
     States which provide automobiles for employees assign them variously to the agency , the individual , or to a central pool.
     Twenty-six states operate a central motor_pool for acquisition , allocation and / or maintenance of state-owned vehicles.
     Nineteen states report laws , policies or regulations for assigning state vehicles in lieu of paying mileage allowances.
   Of these states the average  change-over  point ( at which a car is substituted for allowances ) is 13200 miles per_year.
     Mileage allowances for state employees are of two types : ( a ) actual mileage and ( b ) fixed monthly allowances.
     Actual mileage allowances are itemized reimbursements allowed employees for the use of personally-owned vehicles on state business at the rate of.
07 per mile.
   Fixed monthly allowances are reimbursements for the same purpose except on a non-itemized basis.
   Both allowances are governed by conditions and restrictions set_forth in_detail in the state 's Travel Regulations.
     Rhode_Island 's reimburseable rate of.
07 per mile for use of personally-owned cars compares favorably with other states ' rates.
   The average of states ' rates is.
076 per mile.
     Rhode_Island 's rate of.
07 per mile is considerably lower than reimburseable rates in the federal_government and in industry nationally which approximate a.
09 per mile average.
     Actual mileage allowances are well-administered and not unduly expensive for the state.
   The travel regulations , requirements and procedures governing reimbursement are controlled properly and not overly restrictive.
     Fixed monthly allowances are a controversial subject.
   They have a great advantage in ease of audit time and payment.
   However , they lend_themselves to abuse and inadequate control measures.
   Flat payments over $ 50 per month are more expensive to the state than the assignment of state-owned vehicles.
     Travel_allowances , including subsistence , have been revised by administrative_officials recently and compare favorably with other states ' allowances.
   With few exceptions travelers on state business are allowed actual travel expenses and $ 15 per day subsistence.
   Travel_allowances are well-regulated and pose little problem in administration and / or audit control.
     It is difficult to pinpoint the time_of_origin of the state purchasing automobiles for use of employees in Rhode_Island.
   Few records are available concerning the subject prior to 1940.
   Those that are available shed little light.
   The Registry of Motor_Vehicles indicates that at_least one state automobile was registered as far back as 1917.
   It should be enough to say that the practice of the state buying automobiles is at_least forty years old.
     The best reason that can be advanced for the state adopting the practice was the advent of expanded highway construction during the 1920 s and ' 30 s.
   At_that_time highway_engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties.
   Using privately-owned vehicles was a personal hardship for such employees , and the_matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly justifiable.
     Once the principle was established , the increase in state-owned vehicles came rapidly.
   And reasons other_than employee need contributed to the growth.
   Table 1 immediately below shows the rate_of_growth of vehicles and employees.
   This rate of increase does not signify anything in itself.
   It does not indicate loose management , ineffective controls or poor policy.
   But it does show that automobiles have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same proportion to the increase of state employees.
   In_the_past twenty years the ratio of state-owned automobiles per state employees has varied from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now.
   Whether there were too few automobiles in 1940 or too many now is problematical.
   The fact is simply that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion as employees to use them.
     While the origin of state-owned automobiles may be obscured , subsequent developments concerning the assignment , use , and management of state automobiles can be_related more clearly.
   Prior to 1942 , automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to_which assigned.
   This responsibility included all phases of management.
   It embraced determining when to purchase and when to trade vehicles , who was to drive , when and where repairs were to be made , where gasoline and automobile services were to be obtained and other allied matters.
   In 1942 , however , the nation was at_war.
   Gasoline and automobile_tires were rationed commodities.
   The state was confronted with transportation problems similar to those of the individual.
   It met these problems by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit ( more popularly called the motor_pool ) , a centralized operation for the maintenance and control of all state transportation.
   The motor_pool then , as now , had headquarter facilities in Providence and other garages located throughout the state.
   It was organizationally the responsibility of the Department of Public_Works and was financed on a rotary fund basis with each agency of government contributing to the pool 's operation.
   In 1951 the pool 's operation was transferred to the newly-created Department of Administration , an agency established as the central staff and auxiliary department of the state_government.
   The management of state-owned vehicles since that time has been described in a recent report in the following manner :  Under this new management considerable progress appears to have been made.
   The agencies of government are now billed for the actual cost of services provided to each passenger_car rather_than the prior uniform charge for all cars.
   Whereas the maintenance rotary fund had in_the_past sustained losses considerably beyond expectations , the introduction of the cost-billing system plus other control refinements has resulted in keeping the fund on a proper working basis.
   One indication of the merits of the new management is found in the fact that during the period 1951 - 1956 , while total annual mileage put_on the vehicles increased 35 % , the total maintenance cost increased only 11 %.
    In_order_to further refine the management of passenger vehicles , on July_1 , 1958 , the actual title to every vehicle was transferred , by Executive_Order , to the Division of Methods , Research and Office Services.
   The objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility for the management , assignment , and replacement of all vehicles.
   ( Note : So_far as State Police_cars are_concerned , only their replacement is under this division ).
   This tied_in closely with the current attempt to upgrade state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs ( in light of depreciation ) become excessive.
   Moreover , it allows the present management to reassign vehicles so_that mileage will be more uniformly distributed throughout the fleet ; for_example , if one driver puts_on 22000 miles per_year and another driver 8000 miles per_year , their cars will be switched so_that both cars will have 30000 miles after two years , rather_than 44000 miles ( and related higher maintenance costs ) and 16000 miles respectively .
     The motor_pool is a completely centralized and mechanized operation.
   It handles all types of vehicle maintenance , but concentrates more on  service_station activities  than on extensive vehicle repairs.
   It contracts with outside repair garages for much of the latter work.
   Where the pool excels is in its compilation of maintenance and cost-data studies and analyses.
   Pool records reveal in_detail the cost per mile and miles_per_gallon of each vehicle , the miles traveled in one year or three years , the periods when vehicle costs become excessive , and when cars should be traded for sound economies.
   From this , motor_pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data.
   In 1959 - 60 , vehicles averaged an operating_cost of.
027 per mile.
   Based on this figure and considering depreciation costs of vehicles , pool personnel have determined that travel in_excess of 10000 miles annually is more economical by state car than by payment of allowances for use of personally-owned vehicles.
   They estimate further that with sufficient experience and when cost-data of compact_cars is compiled , the break-even point may be reduced to 7500 miles of travel per_year.
   Table 2 shows operating_cost data of state vehicles selected at_random.
     One matter of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate central garage facilities.
   Present pool quarters at two locations in Providence are crowded , antiquated and , in_general , make_for inefficient operation in_terms_of dispersement of personnel and duplication of such operational needs as stock and repair equipment.
   Good facilities would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle costs even more.
     The purchase of state-owned vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases of the state.
   Requests are made by the motor_pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agencies to_which assignments of cars will be made.
   Bids are evaluated by the Division of Purchases with the assistance of pool staff , and awards for the purchase of the automobiles are made to the lowest responsible bidders.
   Unit prices for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public.
   The reasons are obvious : ( 1 ) the state is buying in quantity , and ( 2 ) it has no federal excise or state sales_tax to pay.
   Until 1958 the state was also entitled to a special type of manufacturers ' discount through the dealers.
     In_that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state motor_pool , cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies but transferred to the rotary fund mentioned earlier.
   This is a normal governmental procedure which reflects more accurately cost-accounting principles.
   The assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is another matter to be covered in_detail later.
     Probably the_most important of all matters for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase , assignment , use , and management of state vehicles.
   The legislature 's role in policy determination in_this area for years has been confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually for the purchase and operation of vehicles.
   The more meaningful policies have been_left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer of the state - the Director of Administration.
    
    There was a time some years ago when local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state_government as_well.
   For many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property_tax.
   This tax was discontinued in 1936.
     Since that time the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed financial burdens on the state which could not have been foreseen in earlier years.
   At_the_same_time there has been an upgrading and expansion of municipal services as_well.
   Thus , there has come_into_being a situation in_which the state must raise all_of its own revenues and , in_addition , must give assistance to its local_governments.
     This financial assistance from the state has become necessary because the local_governments themselves found the property_tax , or at_least at the rates then existing , insufficient for their requirements.
     Consequently there have developed several forms of grants-in-aid and shared taxes , as_well as the unrestricted grant to local_governments for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a sales_tax at the state level.
     Notwithstanding state aid , the local_governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own by strengthening the property_tax.
   This is being done both by the revaluation of real_property and by seeking_out forms of personal_property hitherto neglected or ignored.
     Taxation of tangible movable property in Rhode_Island has been generally of a  hands off  nature due possibly to several reasons : ( 1 ) local assessors , in_the_main , are not well paid and have inadequate office_staffs , ( 2 ) the numerous categories of_this component of personal_property make locating extremely difficult , and ( 3 ) the inexperience of the majority of assessors in evaluating this type of property.
     Among the many problems in the taxing of personal_property , and of movable tangible property in_particular , two are significant : ( 1 ) situs , ( 2 ) fair and equitable assessment of value.
   These problems are not local to Rhode_Island , but are recognized as common to all states.
     Although the laws of the various states , in_general , specify the situs of property , i. e. , residence or domicile of the owner , or location of the property , the exceptions regarding boats , airplanes , mobile_homes , etc. , seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment.
     Rhode_Island law specifies that all real_estate is taxable in the town in_which it is situated.
   It also provides for the taxation of all personal_property , belonging to inhabitants of the state , both tangible and intangible , and the tangible personal_property of non-residents in_this state.
   In defining personal_property , it specifically mentions  all ships or vessels , at_home or abroad .
     Intangible property is taxable wherever the owner has a place of abode the greater portion of the year.
   Although a similar situs for tangible property is mentioned in the statute , this is cancelled_out by the provision that definite kinds of property  and all other tangible property  situated or being in any town is taxable where the property is situated.
   This would seem to fix the tax situs of all movable personal_property at its location on December 31.
     Both boats and aircraft would fall within this category , as_well as motor_vehicles.
   The location of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at_the_time of registration , and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor_vehicle as being situated where it is garaged.
   Obviously , it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the 31 st day of December.
   In_view of the acceptance accorded the status of motor_vehicles for tax purposes , in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or aircraft.
     A recent example of_this problem is the flying of six airplanes , on December 31 , 1960 , from the Newport_Airpark in Middletown , to_the_North Central_Airport in Smithfield.
   This situation resulted in both towns claiming the tax , and probably justifiably.
   Middletown bases its claim on the general provision of the law that  all rateable property , both tangible and intangible , shall be taxed to the owner thereof in the town in_which such owner shall have had his actual place of abode for the larger portion of the twelve ( 12 ) months next preceding the first day of April in each_year .
     The Smithfield tax_assessor , in_turn , claims the tax under the provision of law  and all other tangible personal_property situated or being in any town , in or upon any place of storage * * h shall be taxed to such person in the town where said property is situated .
     This problem of fair and equitable assessment of value is a difficult one to solve in_that the determination of fair valuation is dependent_on local assessors , who in_general are non-professional and part-time personnel taking an individualistic approach to the problem.
   This accounts_for the wide variance in assessment practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in Rhode_Island.
     This condition will undoubtedly continue until such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established , or through mutual agreement of the local assessing officials for a method of standard assessment practice to be adopted.
     The Rhode_Island Public_Expenditure_Council in its publication once commented :  The_most realistic way of facing_up to this problem would be to have the State take_over full responsibility for assessing all taxable property.
   An adequately staffed and equipped State assessing office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go_far toward producing equitable assessments on all properties throughout the State.
   A single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences and complications that are inherent in a system of 39 different and independent assessing units .
     The Institute of Public_Administration , in its report to the State_Fiscal_Study_Commission in 1959 , recommended  consolidating and centralizing all aspects of property_tax administration in a single state agency professionally organized and equipped for the job .
   The resulting setup , it was declared ,  would be similar to_that which is in successful operation in a_number_of metropolitan counties as large or larger than Rhode_Island .
     To determine the practice and attitude of municipal_governments concerning tangible movable property , a questionnaire was sent to all local_government assessors or boards of assessors in Rhode_Island.
     The replies from each individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the established policy of the town in each case.
   There are legitimate reasons for differences_of_opinion among the assessors as_a_whole and among the public officials in each town.
   These opinions of the assessors are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at_the_present_time.
     In_reply to a question of whether they now tax boats , airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles , nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not.
   The wording of the question was quite general and may have been subject to different interpretations.
   One assessor checked boats only , another trailers and tractors , one mentioned house_trailers , and two others referred to trailers without specifying the type.
   In two cases , airplanes only were indicated.
     It is difficult to tabulate exactly what was meant in each individual situation , but the conclusion may be drawn that 21 towns do not assess movable personal_property , and of the remainder only certain types are valued for tax purposes.
   Boats were indicated specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats.
   It would seem , then , that movable property and equipment is not taxed as_a_whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound_to be expedient for that particular kind_of personal_property.
     So few answered the question relating to their efforts to assess movable property that the results are inconclusive.
   Only four towns indicated that they made any_more than a normal effort to list property of_this kind.
     Of greater interest is a question as to whether movable property was assessed according to its location or ownership.
   Fifteen stated that it was according to location , four by residence of the owner , and nineteen did not answer.
     Twenty-seven assessors stated that they were in favor of improved means for assessing movable personal_property , and only five were opposed.
   Seven others expressed no opinion.
   On this point there was fairly general_agreement that assessors would like to do more_than they are doing now.
   It is not clear , however , whether they are thinking_of all movable property or only of boats , trailers , aircraft or certain other types of personal_property whose assessment would be advantageous to their particular towns.
     Another question that was asked of the assessors was whether they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or at the residence of the owner.
   Eighteen voted for assessment by the town in_which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town in_which the owner resides.
   Ten others made no reply.
   Of those who have an opinion , it seems that assessment by location is preferred.
   There was one vote for location being the place where the property is situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment date.
     To summarize , it may be said that there is no one prevailing practice in Rhode_Island with_respect_to the taxation of movable property , that assessors would like to see an improvement , and of those who have an opinion , that assessment by the town of location is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge.
   The need for greater knowledge is evident from their replies.
     Interest has been shown for a_number_of years by local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats.
   Assessors in Rhode_Island are charged not_only with placing a valuation upon real and personal_property , but they also have the responsibility to raise by a tax  a sum not less_than nor more_than  a specified amount as ordered by a city_council or financial town_meeting.
     It has been obvious to the assessors , particularly those in shore communities , that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal_property which they have been unable to reach.
   Through their professional organization , the Rhode_Island Tax Officials Association the question of taxing boats long has been debated and discussed.
   No satisfactory solution has been found , but this is_due more to the difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence on the part of the assessors.
     It has been estimated that the value of boats in Rhode_Island waters is something in_excess of fifty million dollars , excluding commercial boats.
   It is obvious that this is a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessors of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be subject to taxation.
     It is known that at_least five towns ( Barrington , Bristol , Narragansett , Newport and Westerly ) place some value on some boats for tax purposes.
   However , few are taxed , and the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on the date of assessment of town valuations.
     No one really knows how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may be.
   Slightly more_than 5000 boats were registered with the Coast_Guard prior to the recent passage of the state boating law.
   Only a_few_more than 10000 boats had been registered with the Division of Harbors and Rivers at the end of the 1960 boating season , but many had been taken_out of the water early when the threat of a hurricane brought the season to an early close.
     The assessors ' association , meeting at Narragansett in September 1960 , devoted its session to a discussion of the boat problem.
    
    Local industry 's investment in Rhode_Island was the big story in 1960 's industrial development effort.
   Fifty-two companies started or committed themselves to new plant construction , totaling 1418000 square_feet and representing an investment of $ 11900000 ; a new post-World_War 2 , record.
   With minor exceptions , this expansion was instituted either by firms based in Rhode_Island or out-of-state manufacturers already operating here.
     What made these new location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although 1960 was a year of mild business recession throughout the nation , Rhode_Island scored marked progress in new industry , new plants , and new jobs.
     Of the major expansions in 1960 , three were financed under the R._I._Industrial_Building_Authority 's 100 % guaranteed mortgage plan : Collyer_Wire , Leesona_Corporation , and American_Tube + Controls.
   Leading firms that arranged their own financing included Speidel_Corporation , Cornell-Dubilier , Photek , Inc._Division of Textron , Narragansett_Gray Iron_Foundry , W._R._Cobb_Company , and Mays_Manufacturing_Company.
     Expansion and relocation of industry in Rhode_Island is the direct responsibility of the Development_Council 's Industrial_Division , and the figures quoted above indicate a successful year 's operation.
   Industrial_Division personnel worked with 54 out-of-state and 97 Rhode_Island concerns during 1960 , many_of whom are still interested in a Rhode_Island location.
   They are conscious_of this state 's new feeling of optimism and assurance and are definitely impressed by the number of new plants and construction projects in Rhode_Island.
     Although much of the Industrial_Division 's promotional effort is devoted to securing new locations and expansions by major industries , small business is also afforded considerable attention.
   Our Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce carries_on a vigorous program , directly aimed at solving and expediting the problems of manufacturers in the lower employment categories.
     A primary function is the operation of a Government_Bid_Center , which receives bids daily from the Federal_Government 's principal purchasing agencies.
   Assistance is rendered to interested Rhode_Island businessmen concerning interpretation of bid invitations , where to obtain specifications , and follow-ups concerning qualification.
   During the past year , 10517 government bid invitations were received and 4427 procurement leads were mailed to Rhode_Island manufacturers.
     In_addition , the Office 's domestic trade program provided consultant services to those seeking information on establishment of new businesses ; how and where to apply for financial assistance ; details on marketing ; information concerning patents , copyrights and trade marks , availability of technical reports , and other subjects of interest to small business.
     The Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce is also active in the field of international trade , assisting Rhode_Island firms in developing and enlarging markets abroad.
   This office cooperates with the U._S. Department_of_Commerce in giving statewide coverage to services which include : statistics on markets abroad ; locating foreign_agents , buyers , distributors , etc. ; information on foreign and domestic import_duties and regulations , licensing , investments , and establishing of branch representatives or plants abroad , and documentary requirements concerning export shipments and arrangements for payment.
     During the year 1960 , this office supplied 954 visitors with information related to foreign and domestic commerce , and made 73 field visits.
     Our media advertising continued , during 1960 , its previous effective program that stressed such specifics as 100 % financing , plant availabilities , and location advantages.
   We also continued to run a series of ads featuring endorsement of Rhode_Island by industrialists who had recently established new plants here.
     To reach a still greater audience of location-minded manufacturers , our industrial advertising budget for the fiscal_year was increased from $ 32000 to $ 40000 , and the Industrial_Building_Authority 's financial participation was upped from $ 17000 to $ 20000.
     Newspaper advertising was mainly concentrated in the New_York Times and the Wall_Street Journal ( Eastern and Midwestern editions ) which averaged two prominent ads per month , and to_a_lesser_degree the New_York Herald_Tribune and , for the west coast , the Los_Angeles Times and the Wall_Street Journal ( Pacific_Coast edition ).
   In_addition to the regular schedule , advertisements were run for maximum impact in special editions of the New_York Times , Boston_Herald , American_Banker , Electronic_News and , for local promotion , the Providence_Sunday_Journal.
   Magazine advertising included Management Methods , the New_Englander , U._S._Investor , and Plant_Location.
     The direct mail campaign consisted_of 3 intra state mailings of 1680 letters each and 6 out-of-state directed to electronics , plastics , pharmaceutical , and business machine manufacturers , and to publishers.
   These totaled 6768 pieces of correspondence.
     The 1960 advertising_campaign brought a total of 239 inquiries ; 164 from media and 75 from direct mail.
   Two hundred and nineteen were received from 35 of our 50 United_States and 11 came from foreign countries.
   New_York led in the number of inquiries , followed by California , New_Jersey , Massachusetts , and Pennsylvania.
   Among foreign countries responding were Germany , Canada , Brazil and India.
     An important operation in soliciting industrial locations involves what we term  Missionary calls  by one of_this Division 's industrial promotion specialists.
   These consist_of visits , without previous announcement , on top officials of manufacturing concerns located in highly industrialized areas.
   More_than 25 carefully selected cities were visited , including New_York , Brooklyn , Long_Island City , Newark , Elizabeth , Stamford , Waterbury , New_Haven , Bridgeport , Boston , Cambridge , Worcester , and Waltham.
     Out of a total of 603 calls , 452 contacts were established with top_executive personnel.
   We received 76 out-of-state visitors interested in investigating Rhode_Island 's industrial advantages , and Industrial_Division personnel made 55 out-of-state follow-up visits.
     During 1960 , two important conferences were organized by the Development_Council 's Industrial_Division.
   In June , the Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce - in conjunction with local trade associations , chambers_of_commerce , and bank officials - sponsored a World_Trade_Conference at the Sheraton-Biltmore_Hotel.
   Its purpose was to find ways of offsetting the United_States ' declining balance_of_trade for 1958 and 1959.
   Approximately 100 representatives of business attended this conclave and the R._I._Export_Conference_Committee later voted to continue the activity as an annual event.
     On October 8 th of last year , the Industrial_Division sponsored the Governor 's Conference on Industrial_Development at the former Henry_Barnard_School.
   A comprehensive program devoted_to the various phases of the development effort attracted 143 interested individuals.
     Morning sessions included addresses by Ward_Miller , Jr. of the U._S._Dept. of Commerce.
   Richard_Preston , executive_director of the New_Hampshire State_Planning and Development_Commission , and Edwin_C._Kepler of General_Electric_Company.
   Workshop sessions in the afternoon featured development executives from Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Maine , and rounded_out a rewarding program.
     In connection with this conference , a 64 - page supplement was published in the October 2 nd edition of the Providence_Sunday_Journal.
   Devoted_to the improvement in business climate and increase in industrial construction in Rhode_Island , it has proved a valuable mailing piece for this Division.
   More_than 2000 copies have been sent_out to prospective clients.
     Other special mailings by the Industrial_Division included copies of speeches delivered at the Governor 's Conference , letters and brochures to conferees at Med-Chemical_Symposium at University of Rhode_Island and letters and reprints of industrial advertisements to such organizations as Society of Industrial Realtors.
   1184 copies of the R._I._Directory of Manufacturers were distributed :   643 in-state and 541 out-of-state.
     The Industrial_Division published , in 1960 , a new , attractive industrial brochure ,  Rhode_Island - Right For Industry  , and prepared copy for a new_edition of the Directory of Manufacturers ( to be printed shortly ) , and for a new space catalogue.
     Additional promotional activities included organizing the dedication program for Operation_Turnkey , the new automated post_office , and a conference with representatives of Brown_University , Providence_College , and University of Rhode_Island , and eight electronics concerns regarding the inauguration of a training_program for electronics personnel.
     Stated in its simplest terms , the main job of the Planning_Division is to plan for the future of the State of Rhode_Island.
   The activities of the Planning_Division are defined in considerable detail in the enabling_act of the Development_Council , which assigns to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties in the field of planning.
     Two years ago , the Institute of Public_Administration issued an extremely comprehensive report entitled  State-Local Relations in Metropolitan Rhode_Island.
   As the result of an exhaustive review of the recommendations contained in_this report , plus an analysis of our own enabling_act , the Planning_Division developed a_number_of basic planning objectives which caused a reorientation of its work program.
   These objectives are stated here because of their importance in understanding the current activities of the Planning_Division.
     First priority will be given to the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background for all other planning activities in the state.
     Recognizing the truth of the statement by the Institute of Public_Administration that  Metropolian_Planning ( in Rhode_Island ) means , or should mean , state planning  , the state guide plan will take_into_account the metropolitan nature of many_of Rhode_Island 's problems.
     It will continue to be an objective of_this division to encourage the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility of local_government.
   To this end , the community assistance program of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function to make available , on a shared cost basis , technical planning assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their own planning staff.
     The planning division will take the initiative in encouraging planning cooperation at_all levels of government ; among the operating departments of the state ; between the cities and towns of the state ; and on a regional basis between the six New_England states.
     On the basis that all citizens of the state are entitled to benefit equally in the development of its resources , plans for the provision of essential services ( such_as water ) will be based on need regardless_of arbitrary political boundaries , within the framework of the state plan.
     The state development budget will reflect the capital needs of all the state agencies and the priority of the projects in the budget will be based on the state plan.
     In preparing the state guide plan , particular attention will be given means of strengthening the economy of the state through the development of industry and recreation.
     Functionally the planning division carries_out four activities : long-range state planning , current state planning , local planning assistance ; and the preparation of the state development budget.
     The planning division has embarked_on the_most complete and comprehensive state planning program in the nation.
   The long range aspects of_this program are divided into four distinct phases : basic mapping , inventory , analysis and plan and policy formation.
   The work program , as it was originally proposed , was to take five years to complete.
   Recent events - particularly the necessity of providing planning information for the statewide origin / destination study of the Department of Public_Works - indicate that this schedule will have to be accelerated.
   The basic mapping phase of the program has been completed and the inventory phase is scheduled for completion July_1 , 1961.
     Since accurate base maps are necessary for any planning program , the first_step taken by the planning division to implement the long range state plan has been to prepare two series of base maps - one at a scale of 1 inch to a mile , and the second a series of 26 sheets at a scale of 1 inch to 2000 feet , covering the entire state.
   With these maps completed , the inventory phase of the plan has been started.
     With the aid of matching federal funds available under Section 701 of the Housing_Act of 1954 as amended , the planning division began a one year program July_1 , 1960 to complete the inventory phase of the state planning program.
   this phase consists_of four items :   urban land use , rural land use , physical features and public_utility service_areas.
   Since the validity of all subsequent planning depends_on the accuracy of the basic inventory information , great_care is being taken that the inventory is as complete as possible.
     The urban land use study carried_out by the planning division staff has consisted_of identifying and mapping all urban land uses which are of significance to statewide planning.
   The rural land use study is being carried_out under contract by the University of Rhode_Island and identifies all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use.
   The mapping of important physical features such_as slopes and types of soil and the collection of all available information pertaining to public_utility service_areas are being conducted as staff projects and , like the other two inventory projects , are scheduled for completion July_1 , 1961.
     The collection of information is meaningless unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose.
    
    It is not within the scope of_this report elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in Rhode_Island.
   However , a word should be mentioned in regard_to them as independent units of government.
     There are forty-seven special district governments in Rhode_Island ( excluding two regional school districts , four housing authorities , and the Kent_County_Water_Authority ).
   These forty-seven special purpose governments have the authority to levy taxes , to borrow money , own property , sue and be sued , and in_general to exercise normal corporate powers.
   Unlike cities and towns , however , they do not have to submit any financial_statements to the state Bureau of Audits.
   It is not an exaggeration to say that the state_government has little or no fiscal control over these units of government.
   In_addition to the collection of service_charges , the special districts levy annual property_taxes of approximately $ 450000.
     A review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent to this report.
   Included in the findings are :     Forty-six states , including Rhode_Island , end their fiscal_year on June 30.
   The other four states end on varying dates : Alabama ( Sept. 30 ) , New_York ( March 31 ) , Pennsylvania ( May 31 ) , and Texas ( August 31 ).
     In sixteen states , the fiscal_year ending of the cities ( June 30 ) is the same as that of the state :   Alaska , Arizona , California , Delaware , Massachusetts , Montana , Nevada , New_Mexico , North_Carolina , North_Dakota , Oklahoma , Oregon , Vermont , West_Virginia , Wyoming , and Hawaii ).
     In eleven states , the fiscal_year of the cities ends on December 31 , while the state fiscal_year ends on June 30 ( Arkansas , Colorado , Indiana , Kansas , New_Hampshire , New_Jersey , Ohio , South_Dakota , Utah , Washington , and Wisconsin ).
     In eight states whose fiscal_years close on June 30 , a majority of their cities close their fiscal_year on December 31 : ( Georgia , Iowa , Kentucky , Maine , Maryland , Minnesota , Virginia , and South_Carolina ).
     One state , Alabama , closes its fiscal_year on September 30 , and all cities in the state , with one exception , also close fiscal_years on September 30.
     Mississippi closes its fiscal_year on June 30 , while all_of its cities close their fiscal_years on September 30.
     Pennsylvania closes its fiscal_year on May 31.
   All_of its cities close their fiscal_years on December 31.
     The remaining twelve states have varying fiscal_years for the state , city and local_governments.
   However , only Illinois , Oregon , Louisiana and Rhode_Island have a situation in_which the sundry units of government vary widely in_relation_to fiscal uniformity.
     An excellent summary of advantages concerning the uniform fiscal_year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently.
   He listed among the values of fiscal uniformity :     The uniform fiscal_year requires compliance with common_sense administration of local finances : adoption of the budget , or financial plan , in_advance of spending.
     The uniform fiscal_year ensures conformance with another common_sense rule , that of having cash in the bank before checks are drawn.
   It enables towns to make more economical purchases and to take_advantage of cash discounts.
     The uniform fiscal_year promotes more careful budgeting and strengthens control over expenditures.
   By fixing the tax_rate in_advance of spending , upper_limits are set on expenditures.
     The uniform fiscal_year brings the town 's fiscal_year into line with_that of the schools , which expend the largest share of local disbursements.
   This greatly simplifies the town 's bookkeeping and financial reporting.
     The uniform fiscal_year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax anticipation notes.
   Furthermore , tax_collections not immediately needed for current expenditures may be invested in short-term treasury_notes , augmenting the town 's miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax levy.
     The uniform fiscal_year facilitates inter-town comparison of revenues and expenditures.
   When towns have the same fiscal_year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons ; and as the cost of local_government increases , the demand for such comparison also increases.
   Towns having different fiscal_years are difficult to compare.
     Of all advantages , probably none is more important than the elimination of tax anticipation notes.
   Borrowing in anticipation of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority of municipalities at_all_times.
   It may be by bank loans , sale of notes or warrants , or by the somewhat casual method of issuance and registration of warrants.
   In_any_event it is a form of borrowing which could be and should be rendered unnecessary.
   Its elimination would result in the saving of interest costs , heavy when short-term money rates are high , and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always available when needed most.
   This type of borrowing can be reduced to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal_year.
   Any approach toward such a system looks toward saving and security.
     It should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform fiscal_year.
   Both the federal and state_governments commence their fiscal_years on July_1.
   Both units of government contribute increasingly large sums_of_money to the several local_governments in_this state as indicated below :     It has been said that when local_government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property_tax , the lack of a uniform fiscal_year was no great handicap ; but with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid , the emphasis on equalization , and the state-local sharing of responsibility for_certain important functions , this is no_longer true.
   The haphazard fiscal_year calendar is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient state-local revenue and expenditure relationships.
     Although there are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal_years in Rhode_Island , there are also certain difficulties encountered.
   These involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal uniformity than they do actual actual disadvantages to the principle.
   One problem is a matter of shifting dates ; the other , is how to finance the transition.
     Little can be done about the changing of dates.
   This is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars.
   It usually means a confused and disgruntled tax-paying public for a period_of_time.
   But cooperation and understanding between local officials and the citizenry help lessen this problem.
     The other problem is the_matter of financing the transition period in the several cities and towns.
   This will be covered more fully later.
   It should be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial_condition of_that town or city.
   Fortunately , there are no cities or towns in the state , with one or two possible exceptions that are in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change.
   Sacrifice will have to be made in some cases , but it is to the municipality 's advantage to finance the change-over for a short period_of_time rather_than pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely.
     The advantages of a uniform fiscal_year and well synchronized fiscal and tax_collection calendars are sufficiently great for Rhode_Island municipalities to exert effort to secure them.
   The type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent of the adjustments needed.
   Two features are immediately evident.
   First , the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single formula.
   Second , the shift to a uniform July_1 - June 30 fiscal_year will , of itself , improve the tax_collection calendars of the great majority of cities and towns.
   There are at_least two problems to consider : one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar ; the other is how to finance the adjustments when necessary.
   The latter matter is considered in_detail in a later section.
     Twelve cities and towns in Rhode_Island presently indicate some plans to establish a uniform and / or coordinated fiscal-tax year calendar.
   Plans vary from the  talking stage  to establishing special committees to accomplish this end.
   What is important here is that many_of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them.
     An analysis of the fiscal-tax collection year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition may not be as painful as is commonly thought.
   However , it must be stressed that_much depends_upon the financial_condition of the individual cities and towns involved.
     The adjustments needed to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal-tax collection year calendar throughout Rhode_Island , based on a July_1 - June 30 year , are shown below.
     Six cities and towns are presently on a July_1 - June 30 fiscal_year and have coordinated their tax_collection year with_it.
   No change is required for these towns.
   These municipalities include : Barrington , Lincoln , Middletown , Newport , North_Kingstown , and South_Kingstown.
     One town and one city , Coventry and East_Providence , require an adjustment of their fiscal_year only.
   This change will automatically adjust their tax_collection year calendar so_as_to make all tax installments due and payable in the fiscal_year collectible within that year.
     Six cities and towns are now on a July_1 - June 30 fiscal_year and will need only to adjust their tax_collection year calendar to establish uniformity.
   These cities and towns include Bristol , Glocester , Pawtucket , Cumberland , Central_Falls , and Woonsocket.
     Two cities to be considered , Providence and Cranston , are an enigma.
   Both have excellent integration of their fiscal-tax collection year calendars.
   However , neither of these two cities is on the desired July_1 - June 30 fiscal_year.
     The adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal period could be accomplished relatively easy for them.
   In_that both cities end their fiscal_years on September 30 , they could levy taxes for an interim period of nine months , commencing with September 30 and ending with June 30.
   These three installment dates would be :   October 26 , January 26 , and April 25 ( Providence ) and November 15 , February 16 and May 15 ( Cranston ).
   Both would start their new fiscal_year on July_1.
   Their tax_collection calendar could then be : July 25 , October 26 , January 26 , and April 25 , ( Providence ) ; and August 15 , November 15 , February 17 , and May 15 , ( Cranston ).
   Under this plan both Cranston and Providence would be on the uniform fiscal_year but would still be using the same installment periods.
     The remaining twenty-three towns have fiscal_years which end prior to June 30.
   All_of these towns will require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax_collection years.
   Assuming an adjustment to the July_1 - June 30 fiscal_year , the required adjustment of the tax_collection years and the towns involved are shown in Table 3.
     Aside from the_matter of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars , there is the problem of financing the adjustment when this is necessary.
   It should be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental requirements.
   In many communities there is simply no financial problem ; it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods , careful fiscal planning and management , or some like combination of techniques.
   In other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial burden have been sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of fiscal_year changes.
   Fortunately , such cases in Rhode_Island are more the exception than the rule.
     As shown earlier in Table 1 , the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax_collection calendars.
   In_addition , no two Rhode_Island communities are identical in_relation_to their over-all financial_condition.
   These factors practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible ; each situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax calendars , the financial_condition of the treasuries , and the length of the transition interval.
   Suitable plans range from those that are very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require borrowing ranging from short-term serial notes to long-term bonds.
     The financial problem , where it exists , usually stems from the adoption of a budget for the transitional or adjustment period.
   For those communities which have financial difficulties in effecting adjustments , there are a_number_of alternatives any one of_which alone , or in combination with others , would minimize if_not even eliminate the problem.
    
    The theme of Rhode_Island Heritage_Week for 1961 will be  Independence and Union .
   It commemorates the 185 th anniversary of Rhode_Island 's Independence when , upon May 4 , 1776 , the General_Assembly , by its action , established the first free republic in the New_World.
     As this year marks the centennial of the beginning of the Civil_War , this fact is being commemorated with several exhibits throughout the State , but most_of_all paying tribute to the first Rhode_Island Volunteers who rushed to the defense of the City of Washington , putting at the disposal of President_Lincoln the only fully equipped and best trained regiment at this time.
     On April 30 , ceremonies commemorating the departure of these volunteers will take_place at 1 : 00 P._M. at the Dexter_Training Grounds in Providence.
   The Independence_Day celebration will be properly observed with a big military and civic parade from West_Warwick to the Greene_Homestead in Anthony ; And now , therefore , do I , John_A._Notte , Jr. , Governor of the State of Rhode_Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim the week of April 29 th to May 7 th , 1961 , as Rhode_Island Heritage_Week , advising our citizens that throughout this week many historic houses and beautiful gardens will be open_to visitors as_well as industrial plants , craft shops , museums and libraries and I earnestly urge all to take_advantage of these opportunities to see as_many of these places as they can during this outstanding week.
     In testimony whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this 21 st day of April , in the year of Our Lord , one_thousand nine hundred and sixty-one and on Independence , the one_hundred and eighty-fifth.
   Governor.
     The year 1961 marks the fourteenth anniversary of the unification of our Armed_Forces under the National_Security_Act of 1947.
     National defense , like the continuing search for peace with freedom and justice for all , is  everybody 's business .
   Our investment in_this effort , the greatest in our Nation 's history , reflects our determination to ensure the peace and the future of freedom.
     It is a sound investment.
   As the President has said ,  only when our arms are sufficient beyond_doubt can we be certain that they will never be employed .
     Armed_Forces Day is the annual report on this investment , a public_presentation designed to give our own people , and the people of other lands who stand with us for peace with freedom and justice , the best possible opportunity to see and understand what we have and why we have it.
     It is the purpose of Armed_Forces Day to give Americans an opportunity to honor men of the Armed_Forces , those who have made the supreme sacrifice , those who remain to preserve our security.
   Freedom depends_upon them ; Now , therefore , do i , John_A._Notte , Jr. , Governor of the State of Rhode_Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim Saturday , May 20 th , 1961 , as Armed_Forces Day , reminding our citizens that we should rededicate ourselves to our Nation , respecting the uniforms as the guardians of our precious liberty.
     In testimony whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this 17 th day of May , in the year of Our Lord , one_thousand nine hundred and sixty-one , and of Independence , the one_hundred and eighty-sixth.
   Governor.
     The President_of_the_United_States , pursuant_to a Joint_Resolution of Congress , has issued a proclamation each_year since 1933 declaring may 22 nd to be National_Maritime_Day.
     This date in 1819 marked the sailing of the S._S.  Savannah  from Savannah , Georgia , for Liverpool.
   This voyage was the first successful crossing of the Atlantic under steam propulsion.
   The day is now appropriately set_aside to honor the American men and women who have contributed to the success of our merchant_marine fleet in peace and war.
     The Merchant_Marine is the  Fourth Arm of Defense  , for a strong and effective American Merchant_Marine is essential to the economy and security of our Nation.
     Through trade and travel across the seas the American Merchant_Marine is carrying_out its historic mission of linking the United_States_of_America with friendly nations across the seas ; And now , therefore , do I , John_A._Notte , Jr. , Governor of the State of Rhode_Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim Monday , May 22 nd , 1961 , as National_Maritime_Day , reminding our citizens that American Merchant_ships and American seamen are ready at_all_times to serve our Nation in the cause of freedom and justice.
     In testimony whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this 20 th day of April , in the year of Our Lord , one_thousand nine hundred and sixty-one , and of Independence , the one_hundred and eighty-fifth.

     The Miss Rhode_Island Pageant is sponsored by the Rhode_Island Junior Chamber_of_Commerce as a part of the nation-wide search for the typical American girl - a Miss_America from Rhode_Island.
   This is an official preliminary contest of the Miss_America_Pageant held each September in Atlantic_City.
   The ideal girl - possessed of talent , poise , intelligence , personality and beauty of face and figure - is chosen each_year to represent Rhode_Island.
     Many hours are given free by the Jaycees to make this and all local pageants outstanding events.
   Proceeds realized from these pageants are used by the Jaycees to help support their various youth , health , welfare and community betterment activities throughout the state.
     Miss_Sally_May_Saabye , ( Miss Rhode_Island 1960 ) says that within a short_time - on June 17 th - her reign will come to an end.
   She hopes that all will support the contestants from our own community by attending our Pageants and the State_Pageant_June 17 ; And now , therefore , do I , John_A._Notte , Jr. , Governor of the State of Rhode_Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim the week of June 11 th to 17 th , 1961 , as Miss Rhode_Island Pageant_Week , with deep appreciation to the Jaycees , local and statewide , for the presentation of their beautiful Pageants and the encouragement of all Rhode_Island girls to participate.
     In testimony whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this 11 th day of June , in the year of Our Lord , one_thousand nine hundred and sixty-one , and of Independence , the one_hundred and eighty-sixth.
   Governor.
     For_the_purpose_of maintaining international peace and promoting the advancement of all people , the United_States_of_America joined in founding the United_Nations.
     The United_Nations Charter sets_forth standards which , if adhered to , will promote peace and justice throughout_the_world.
   It is extremely important for each American to realize that the theme  The United_Nations is your business  applies to him personally.
     The world desperately needs the United_Nations.
   United_Nations Day is the birthday of the United_Nations , mankind 's noblest attempt to establish lasting peace with justice ; And now , therefore , do I , John_A._Notte , Jr. , Governor of the State of Rhode_Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim Tuesday , October 24 th , 1961 , as United_Nations Day , calling_upon all our citizens to engage in appropriate observances , demonstrating faith in the United_Nations and thereby contributing to a better understanding of the aims of the United_Nations throughout the land.
     In testimony whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this 5 th day of July , in the year of Our Lord , one_thousand nine hundred and sixty-one , and of Independence , the one_hundred and eighty-sixth.

     The ballet originated_in Italy about 1450.
   At_that_time it was a series of sophisticated social dances whose steps were often combined with other steps devised by the choreographer.
   Ballet flowered in Italy during the next hundred years , and about 1550 was carried to France when the Italian princess , Catherine de Medicis , married the King of France.
   The_most famous ballet of_that time was called Ballet_Comique de la Reine ( 1581 ).
   Dances alternated with sung or spoken verses.
   Ballets were used in opera from its beginning.
   They were placed either in_the_middle of the acts or in the intermissions.
     The State_Ballet of Rhode_Island , the first incorporated group , was formed for_the_purpose_of extending knowledge of the art of ballet in the Community , to promote interest in ballet performances , to contribute to the cultural life of the State , and to provide opportunity for gifted dance students who , for one reason or another , are unable to pursue a career and to develop others for the professional state ; And now , therefore , do I , John_A._Notte , Jr. , Governor of the State of Rhode_Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim the week of Monday , November 13 , 1961 , as the State_Ballet of Rhode_Island Week , requesting all Rhode_Islanders to give special attention to this unusual event which should contribute to the cultural life of the State.
     In testimony whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this 23 d day of October , in the year of Our Lord , one_thousand nine hundred and sixty-one , and of Independence , the one_hundred and eighty-sixth.

     As another Thanksgiving draws_near , let us take time_out from the often hectic pace of our lives to try and recapture the feelings that filled the hearts of the Pilgrims on the first Thanksgiving.
     The Pilgrims gathered to thank the Lord for His benevolence during their first year in the new land.
   They had been through trying times , but their faith in the Almighty had given them the courage and the strength to meet and overcome the many problems and difficulties that were the price they had to pay for freedom.
   And as the Pilgrims bowed their heads in humble gratitude , they shared another feeling - the anticipation of_what the future held for them and their posterity.
   They could not guess that from their concepts of liberty and freedom would some_day be_born a new nation that for years would be the symbol of hope to the oppressed countries of the world.
   They simply turned_to God filled with gratitude and faith.
     We who are living today may learn a valuable lesson from those who celebrated the first Thanksgiving_Day.
   The Lord has shown time_and_time_again His love for us.
   We have only to compare the liberty and high standard_of_living we enjoy in_this great country with the oppression and frugality of other nations to realize with humble gratitude that God 's Providence has been with us since the very beginning of our country.
   And yet , accompanying our gratitude is the realization that we are living in a crucial time.
   With world peace constantly being threatened , most_of us regard the future skeptically , and even with fear.
   It is at this time that we should imitate the Pilgrims by accompanying our prayers of thanks with the conviction that we shall continue to be in dire need for the Lord 's protection in_the_future , if we are to have peace ; Now , therefore , do I , John_A._Notte , Jr. , Governor of the State of Rhode_Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim Thursday , November 23 rd , 1961 , as Thanksgiving_Day ,     And so , let us remember on_this_day not_only to thank the Almighty Who gave hope and courage to the Pilgrims , but also to place our trust in Him that He will continue to protect us in_the_future as He has in_the_past.
     In testimony whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this 21 st day of November , in the year of Our Lord , one_thousand nine hundred and sixty-one and of Independence , the one_hundred and eighty-sixth.

    In the same period , 431 presentations by members of the staff were made to local , national , and international medical groups.
     The education function of the Institute is carried_on by the staff in the departments of pathology and its consultants.
   During fiscal_year 1959 , six courses were conducted : Forensic_Pathology , Application of Histochemistry to Pathology , Pathology of Diseases of Laboratory Animals , Opthalmic_Pathology , Pathology of the Oral Regions , and a Cardiovasculatory_Pathology_Seminar.
   During fiscal_year 1960 , seven courses were conducted : Application of Histochemistry to Pathology , Forensic_Pathology , Pathology of Diseases of Laboratory Animals , Pathology of the Oral Regions , Opthalmic_Pathology , Forensic Sciences Symposium , and Orthopedic_Pathology.
   From 1 July 1960 through 31 January 1961 , six courses were conducted : Workshop in Resident_Training in Pathology , Pathology of Diseases of Laboratory Animals , Application of Histochemistry of Pathology , Orthopedic_Pathology , Forensic Sciences Symposium , and Forensic_Pathology.
     During fiscal_years 1959 and 1960 , there were 139 military and civilian students who came to the Institute for varying periods of special instruction.
     The Institute is engaged in an extensive program of medico-military scientific research in both morphological and experimental pathology.
   Among the specific areas of concentration in_which the staff is engaged , are such projects as biological and biochemical studies of the effects of microwaves ; study of motor end plates in man and animals ; investigation of respiratory_diseases of laboratory animals ; metabolic responses to reduced oxygen tension ; neuropathology of nuclear and cosmic radiation ; carcinoma of prostate ; evaluation of histochemical techniques ; and hip dysplasia in dogs.
   There has been an increase in cooperative research with other Federal agencies and civilian institutions.
     During the period from 1 July 1960 through 31 January 1961 , additional research affiliations were effected with the U._S._Army_Medical_Research and Development_Command to conduct research in procedures for quantitative electron_microscopy , and for the study of biophysical and biological studies of the structure and function of ocular tissue.
   Also , the Defense_Atomic_Support_Agency sponsored a long-range study at this Institute on the response of massive suspension cultures of mammalian cells to acute radiation.
   Other scientific agencies , both Federal and civilian , supported studies in quantitative electron microscopical approach to microchemistry and microcytochemistry ; the investigation of the relationship of diphosphopyridine nucleotide synthesizine enzyme to tumor growth ; morphological study and classification of leukemia and lymphoma cases in animals ; and the study of structural changes in M. leprae and other mycobacteria.
     The Medical_Illustration_Service is responsible_for the collection , publication , exhibition , and file of medical illustration material of medico-military importance to the Armed_Forces.
   In_addition to maintaining a permanent central file of illustrations of diseases , wounds , and injuries of military importance , it provides facilities for clinical photography , photomicrography , and medical arts , and operates a printing plant , by permission of Congressional_Committee , for publication of an  Atlas of Tumor_Pathology .
   It also maintains shops for the design and fabrication of exhibits , training aids and instruments and libraries for the loan of films and teaching lantern_slide sets.
     During this period , a total of 762 exhibits were presented at 442 medical and scientific meetings.
   Of these exhibits , 154 were newly constructed.
   Twenty-nine exhibits received awards.
     Visual and operable training aids developed by the Medical_Illustration_Service , were used in support of Army_Medical_Service mass casualty exercises.
   Members of the Medical_Illustration_Service lectured and conducted demonstrations on the use of training aids to military_personnel and various civilian medical organizations.
   Demonstrations of new and projected training aids were conducted at the Medical_Service_Instructor 's Conference , Brooke_Army Medical_Center , Texas.
     In support of the emphasis placed by the Department_of_Defense on instruction in emergency medical_care , the Medical_Illustration_Service developed casualty simulation kits and rescue breathing manikins which are being field_tested ; and overhead_projector transparency sets on the subjects of Military_Sanitation : First_Aid for Soldiers ; Bandaging and Splinting ; the Emergency_Medical_Treatment Unit , Phase 1 , ; and Emergency_War_Surgery in support of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ( NATO ) Handbook.
   Fifty lantern_slide teaching sets on the subject of  Emergency_War_Surgery ( NATO )  were assembled and distributed to the Medical Military_Services of foreign Governments associated with NATO and South-East_Asia_Treaty_Organization.
   The_British and Canadian Liaison Officers , as_well as Office of Civil and Defense_Mobilization , the American Red_Cross , and similar interested organizations were informed from_time_to_time as training aids were developed.
     Nine veterinary lantern_slide teaching sets were developed and distributed , and lantern_slide teaching sets on 21 pathology subjects were added to the loan library of the Medical_Illustration_Service.
   Illustrations were prepared for 11 Department of the Army manuals and one Graphic_Training_Aid.
   Sixteen lantern_slide sets were loaned to the Government of India and eight sets were forwarded to the U._S._Embassy , Managua , Nicaragua for the Educational_Exchange Program.
   The Senate_Subcommittee on Reorganization and International_Organizations was provided samples of visual aids on first_aid and personal health produced by the Medical_Illustration_Service.
     Six fascicles ( 10000 copies each ) of the  Atlas of Tumor_Pathology  were completed during the period of_this report.
     This consists_of 25 individual registries , two of_which were added during fiscal_years 1959 - 1960 ( the Registry of Forensic_Pathology and the Testicular_Tumor_Registry ).
   These registries are sponsored by 18 national medical , dental , and veterinary societies and have as their mission the assembling of selected cases of interest to military medicine and of establishing through the mechanism of follow-up of living patients the natural_history of various diseases of military-medical importance.
   The American_Registry of Pathology operates as a cooperative enterprise in medical research and education between the Armed_Forces Institute of Pathology and the civilian medical_profession on a national and international basis , under such conditions as may be agreed upon between the National_Research_Council and The Surgeons_General of the Army , Navy , and Air_Force.
   The staff utilized the collected material in these registries for numerous lectures to national and international meetings , exhibits , and published studies.
   During the period of_this report , 37470 new cases were entered into the various registries.
   These were selected carefully and included not_only detailed clinical information but adequate pathology of value for research and educational purposes.
     In_this same period , six new fascicles of the Atlas of Tumor_Pathology were published and distributed to medical_centers world-wide.
   There were 54320 copies of fascicles sold and 642 copies distributed free during this period.
   Forty-five new Clinico-pathologic Conferences were prepared , bringing the total to 61 available for loan distribution.
   Nine new teaching Clinico-pathologic_Conference sets were prepared , which makes a total of 70 types of teaching sets for loan.
   During this period , 7827 teaching sets were distributed on loan.
   The Clinico-pathologic Conferences have been acknowledged as of great value and in consequent great demand by the small isolated military_hospitals.
   The demand for teaching sets continues unabated since they provide the means for the military physicians to review the pathology of selected disease processes or organ systems for review of basic sciences and correlation of clinical physiological behavior with structural changes.
     In fiscal_year 1959 , the Medical_Museum was moved to Chase_Hall , a temporary building on Independence_Avenue at Ninth_Street , Southwest , and continued to display to the public the achievements of the Armed_Forces Medical Services.
   During the period of_this report , 63 panel exhibits depicting the latest developments in medical research were displayed.
   Of the 375 exhibits ( of all types ) shown , 161 were new or refurbished.
   Of the 885 specimens newly mounted or refurbished , 254 were prepared for other agencies.
   Eighty-five specimens were loaned for study purposes.
   An exhibit ,  Macropathology - An Ancient Art , A new Science  , was presented at the annual meeting of the American_Medical_Association.
     A three-dimensional exhibit depicting  A Century of Naval_Medicine  was formally presented to The Director by George_S._Squibb , great-grandson of the founder of E._R._Squibb and Sons , for permanent display in the Museum.
     Space was provided for short-time guest medical exhibits , and the Museum collected new accessions of microscopes , medical , surgical , and diagnostic instruments , uniform , and similar items of historical medico-military significance.
     During the period , the laboratory rendered centralized macropathological service to qualified requesters.
   Specimens were mounted for military_installations , governmental agencies , and medical_schools.
     Three hundred five copies of the Manual of Macropathological Techniques were distributed.
   Thirty-five military and civilian students received laboratory training.
     During fiscal_years 1959 and 1960 , there were 795586 visitors to the Museum.
     During the period from 1 July 1960 through 31 January 1961 , the Medical_Museum was required to move to Temporary Building  S  on the Mall from Chase_Hall.
   Throughout the period and during the movement operation , the Museum continued its functional support of the Armed_Forces Institute of Pathology.
     The Armed_Forces Medical Publication Agency , established in 1949 , has published , since January 1950 , the United_States Armed_Forces Medical_Journal as a triservice publication to furnish material of professional interest to Medical_Department officers of the three military_services.
   Its supplement , the Medical Technicians Bulletin , supplied similar material_to enlisted medical personnel.
   These publications replaced the U._S._Naval_Medical_Bulletin , published continuously from 1907 through 1959 , as_well_as the Navy 's Hospital_Corps Quarterly and the Bulletin of the U._S._Army_Medical_Department , published from 1922 to 1949.
   In_addition , their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication of a contemplated Air_Force medical bulletin.
   Estimated annual savings resulting from publication of the Journal and Bulletin on a triservice basis , as compared with the cost of producing separate periodicals for each service , were between $ 65000 and $ 70000.
   Additionally , on the many ships at_sea and in the smaller naval stations , the availability of the Journal removed the necessity of subscribing_to several additional journals of civilian origin over and above the quantity now authorized , in_order_to provide any reasonably comparable coverage.
     From 1 July 1958 to 30 June 1960 , 24 numbers of the Journal and nine of the Bulletin were published.
   Each Journal contained articles of professional and clinical interest , and departments devoted to military medical news , reviews of new books , and other features of interest to officers of the medical services.
   The Council on National_Defense of the American_Medical_Association contributed a brief article to each issue entitled ,  This is Your A. M. A.
 .
     Beginning with the October 1959 issue of the Journal , the method of production of copy for photo-offset reproduction was changed from varityping to hot typesetting.
   This resulted in an improved appearance , but was followed by an increase in printing cost that necessitated the institution of major economies to keep within the total of allocated funds.
   The use of 100 instead of 140 substance paper plus the adoption of side stapling beginning with the May 1960 issue reduced costs sufficiently to allow completion of the fiscal_year with nearly $ 4000 in unexpended funds.
     Two special issues were published , one for November 1959 on Space_Medicine , the other the Tenth_Anniversary issue for January 1960.
   The February 1960 issue marked the reinstitution of the section entitled ,  The Medical_Officer_Writes .
   Replacing the discontinued Medical Technicians Bulletin , publication of_which was suspended with the November-December 1959 issue , a section called  Technical Notes  was inaugurated on a bimonthly basis beginning with the April 1960 issue.
   Occasional features were published on historical medicine , special reports , bibliography , and  Collector 's Items .
   In May 1960 , the Armed_Forces Institute of Pathology began a series of articles on the  Medical_Museum  , and in June , the Institute started contributing a regular monthly  Case for Diagnosis .
   The Institute also planned to furnish a regular series of articles , beginning in the fall of 1960 , on its more significant Scientific Exhibits.
     The Armed_Forces Epidemiological Board agreed to submit each_month a report for one of its 12 commissions , so_that each commission will report once a year on some phase of its work calculated to be of particular interest and value to medical_officers of the Armed_Forces.
   The first report in_this continuing series appeared in the September 1960 issue of the Journal.
    
    In 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex_numbers.
   These are defined by a simple involutorial transformation of the points in_which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface bearing a curve of symbol * * f.
   Then in 2 we show that any line involution with the properties that ( a ) It has no complex of invariant lines , and ( b ) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve , is necessarily of the type discussed in 1.
   No generalization of these results to spaces of more_than three dimensions has so_far been found possible.
     Let Q be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli * * f and * * f , and let \ g be a * * f curve of order k on Q.
   A general line l meets Q in two points , * * f and * * f , through each of_which passes a unique generator of the regulus , * * f , whose lines are simple secants of \ g.
   On these generators let * * f and * * f be , respectively , the harmonic conjugates of * * f and * * f with_respect_to the two points in_which the corresponding generator meets \ g.
   The line * * f is the image of l.
   Clearly , the transformation is involutorial.
     We observe first that no line , l , can meet its image except at one of its intersections with Q.
   For if it did , the plane of l and l ' would contain two generators of * * f , which is impossible.
   Moreover , from the definitive transformation of intercepts on the generators of * * f , it is clear that the only points of Q at which a line can meets its image are the points of \ g.
   Hence the totality of singular lines is the kth order complex of lines which meet \ g.
     The invariant lines are the lines of the congruence of secants of \ g , since each of these meets Q in two points which are invariant.
   The order of_this congruence is * * f , since * * f secants of a curve of symbol ( a , b ) on a quadric surface pass through an arbitrary point.
   The class of the congruence is * * f , since an arbitrary plane meets \ g in k points.
     Since the complex of singular lines is of order k and since there is no complex of invariant lines , it follows from the formula * * f that the order of the involution is * * f.
     There are various sets of exceptional lines , or lines whose images are not unique.
   The_most obvious of these is the quadratic complex of tangents to Q , each line of_which is transformed into the entire pencil of lines tangent to Q at the image of the point of tangency of the given line.
   Thus pencils of tangents to Q are transformed into pencils of tangents.
   It is interesting that a 1 : 1 correspondence can be established between the lines of two such pencils , so_that in_a_sense a unique image can actually be assigned to each tangent.
   For the lines of any plane , | p , meeting Q in a conic C , are transformed into the congruence of secants of the curve C ' into which C is transformed in the point involution on Q.
   In_particular , tangents to C are transformed into tangents to C '.
   Moreover , if * * f and * * f are two planes intersecting in a line l , tangent to Q at a point P , the two free intersections of the image curves * * f and * * f must coincide at P ' , the image of P , and at this point * * f and * * f must have a common tangent l '.
   Hence , thought_of as a line in a particular plane | p , any tangent to Q has a unique image and moreover this image is the same for all planes through l.
     Each generator , | l , of * * f is also exceptional , for each is transformed into the entire congruence of secants of the curve into which that generator is transformed by the point involution on Q.
   This curve is of symbol * * f since it meets | l , and hence every line of * * f in the * * f invariant points on | l and since it obviously meets every line of * * f in a single point.
   The congruence of its secants is therefore of order * * f and class * * f.
     A final class of exceptional lines is identifiable from the following considerations : Since no two generators of * * f can intersect , it follows that their image curves can have no free intersections.
   In_other_words , these curves have only fixed intersections common to them all.
   Now the only way in_which all curves of the image family of * * f can pass through a fixed point is to have a generator of * * f which is not a secant but a tangent of \ g , for then any point on such a generator will be transformed into the point of tangency.
   Since two curves of symbol * * f on Q intersect in * * f points , it follows that there are * * f lines of * * f which are tangent to \ g.
   Clearly , any line , l , of any bundle having one of these points of tangency , T , as vertex will be transformed into the entire pencil having the image of the second intersection of l and Q as vertex and lying in the plane determined by the image point and the generator of * * f which is tangent to \ g at T.
   A line through two of these points , * * f and * * f , will be transformed into the entire bilinear congruence having the tangents to \ g at * * f and * * f as directrices.
     A conic , C , being a ( 1 , 1 ) curve on Q , meets the image of any line of * * f , which we have already found to be a * * f curve on Q , in * * f points.
   Hence its image , C ' , meets any line of * * f in * * f points.
   Moreover , C ' obviously meets any line * * f in a single point.
   Hence C ' is a * * f curve on Q.
   Therefore , the congruence of its secants , that_is the image of a general plane field of lines , is of order * * f and class * * f.
   Finally , the image of a general bundle of lines is a congruence whose order is the order of the congruence of invariant lines , namely * * f and whose class is the order of the image congruence of a general plane field of lines , namely * * f.
     The preceding observations make it clear that there exist line involutions of all orders greater than 1 with no complex of invariant lines and with a complex of singular lines consisting exclusively of the lines which meet a twisted curve \ g.
   We now shall show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily of the type we have just described.
     To do this we must first show that every line which meets \ g in a point P meets its image at P.
   To see this , consider a general pencil of lines containing a general secant of \ G.
   By ( 1 ) , the image of_this pencil is a ruled surface of order * * f which is met by the plane of the pencil in a curve , C , of order * * f.
   On C there is a * * f correspondence in_which the * * f points cut from C by a general line , l , of the pencil correspond to the point_of_intersection of the image of l and the plane of the pencil.
   Since C is rational , this correspondence has k coincidences , each of_which implies a line of the pencil which meets its image.
   However , since the pencil contains a secant of \ g it actually contains only * * f singular lines.
   To avoid this contradiction it is necessary that C be composite , with the secant of \ g and a curve of order * * f as components.
   Thus it follows that the secants of \ g are all invariant.
   But if this is the case , then an arbitrary pencil of lines having a point , P , of \ g as vertex is transformed into a ruled surface of order * * f having * * f generators concurrent at P.
   Since a ruled surface of order n with n concurrent generators is necessarily a cone , it follows finally that every line through a point , P , of \ g meets its image at P , as asserted.
     Now consider the transformation of the lines of a bundle with vertex , P , on \ g which is effected by the involution as_a_whole.
   From the preceding remarks , it is clear that such a bundle is transformed into itself in an involutorial fashion.
   Moreover , in_this involution there is a cone of invariant lines of order * * f , namely the cone of secants of \ g which pass through P.
   Hence it follows that the involution within the bundle must be a perspective de Jonquieres involution of order * * f and the invariant locus must have a multiple line of multiplicity either * * f or * * f.
   The first possibility requires that there be a line through P which meets \ g in * * f points ; the second requires that there be a line through P which meets \ g in * * f points.
   In each case , lines of the bundles are transformed by involutions within the pencils they determine with the multiple secant.
   In the first case the fixed elements within each pencil are the multiple secant and the line joining the vertex , P , to the intersection of \ g and the plane of the pencil which does not lie on the multiple secant.
   In the second , the fixed elements are the lines which join the vertex , P , to the two intersections of \ g and the plane of the pencil which do not lie on the multiple secant.
   The multiple secants , of_course , are exceptional and in each case are transformed into cones of order * * f.
     Observations similar to these can be made at each point of \ g.
   Hence \ g must have either a regulus of * * f-fold secants or a regulus of * * f-fold secants.
   Moreover , if * * f , no two of the multiple secants can intersect.
   For if such were the case , either the plane of the two lines would meet \ g in more_than k points or , alternatively , the order of the image regulus of the pencil determined by the two lines would be too high.
   But if no two lines of the regulus of multiple secants of \ g can intersect , then the regulus must be quadratic , or in_other_words , \ g must be either a * * f or a * * f curve on a nonsingular quadric surface.
     We now observe that the case in_which \ g is a * * f curve on a quadric is impossible if the complex of singular lines consists exclusively of the lines which meet \ g.
   For any pencil in a plane containing a * * f-fold secant of \ g has an image regulus which meets the plane of the pencil in * * f lines , namely the images of the lines of the pencil which pass through the intersection of \ g and the multiple secant , plus an additional component to account_for the intersections of the images of the general lines of the pencil.
   However , if there is no additional complex of singular lines , the order of the image regulus of a pencil is precisely * * f.
   This contradicts the preceding observations , and so , under the assumption of_this paper we must reject the possibility that \ g is a * * f curve on a quadric surface.
     Continuing with the case in_which \ g is a * * f curve on a quadric Q , we first observe that the second regulus of Q consists precisely of the lines which join the two free intersections of \ g and the planes through any one of the multiple secants.
   For each of these lines meets Q in three points , namely two points on \ g and one point on one of the multiple secants.
     Now consider an arbitrary line , l , meeting Q in two points , * * f and * * f.
   If | a is the multiple secant of \ g which passes through * * f and | b is the simple secant of \ g which passes through * * f , and if * * f are the points in_which | a meets \ g , and if * * f is the image of * * f on the generator | b , it follows that the image of the line * * f is * * f.
    
    Overwhelmed with the care of five young children and concerned about persistent economic difficulties due_to her husband 's marginal income , her defense of denial was excessively strong.
   Thus the lack of effective recognition of the responsibilities involved in caring for two babies showed signs of becoming a disabling problem.
   The result , dramatically visible in a matter of days in the family 's disrupted daily functioning , was a phobic-like fear that some terrible harm would befall the second twin , whose birth had not been anticipated.
   Soon Mrs._B.
 's fears threatened to burst into a full-blown panic concerning the welfare of the entire family.
   Inability to care for the other children , difficulty in feeding the babies , who seemed colicky , bone-weary fatigue , repeated crying episodes , and short_tempers reflected the family 's helplessness in coping_with the stressful situation.
   Clearly , this was a family in crisis.
     Mrs._B. compared her feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and helplessness at_the_time of her mother 's death when she was eight , as_well as her subsequent anger at her father for remarrying.
   Her previous traumatic experiences flashed through her mind as if they had happened yesterday.
   On the anniversary of her father 's death she poured_out with agonized tears her feelings of guilt about not having attended his funeral.
   In the family 's own words ( during the third of twelve visits ) , they had  reached the crisis peak - either the situation will give or we will break !
     Direct confrontation and acceptance of Mrs._B.
 's anger against the second baby soon dissipated her fears of annihilation.
   Abreaction of her anxiety and guilt concerning the death of her parents , when linked up with her current feelings of anger and her fears of loss , abandonment , and annihilation , produced further relief of tension.
   In a joint interview Mr. and Mrs._B. were helped to understand the meaning of a younger son 's wandering away_from_home in_terms_of his feelings of displacement in reaction to the arrival of the twins.
   The father , accurately perceiving the child 's needs , not_only respected them as worthy of his attention , but immediately satisfied them by taking him on his lap along with the twins , saying ,  I have a big lap ; there is room for you , too , Johnnie .
   Simultaneously , a variety of environmental supports - a calm but not too motherly homemaker , referral for temporary economic aid , intelligent use of nursing_care , accompaniment to the well-baby clinic for medical advice on the twins ' feeding problem - combined to prevent further development of predictable pathological mechanisms.
   Follow-up visits of the nurse and social_worker indicated continued success in the care of the new babies as_well as a marked improvement in the family 's day-to-day mental_health and social functioning.
     As seen in the B. family , there must be an attempt to help the client develop conscious awareness of the problem , especially in the absence of a formal request for assistance.
   The lack of awareness usually springs from deep but disguised anxiety , often assuming the superficial guise of  not knowing  or  not caring .
   The unhealthy use of denial in the initial reaction to a stress must be handled through the medium of a positive controlled transference.
   In_general , the approach is more active than passive , more out-reaching than reflective.
   While some regression is inevitable , it is discouraged rather_than encouraged so_that the transference does not follow the stages of planned regression associated with certain casework adaptations of the psychoanalytic model for insight therapy.
     To establish an emotionally meaningful relationship the worker must demonstrate actual or potential helpfulness immediately , preferably within the first interview , by meeting the client 's specific needs.
   These needs usually concern the reduction of guilt and some relief of tension.
   The initial interview must be therapeutic rather_than purely exploratory in an information-seekingsense.
   In_this relationship-building stage the worker must communicate confidence in the client 's ability to deal with the problem.
   In so doing he implicitly offers the positive contagion of hope as a kind_of maturational dynamic to counteract feelings of helplessness and hopelessness generally associated with the first stages of stress impact.
   Thus , the client receives enough ego support to engage in constructive efforts on_his_own behalf.
   Here there is a specific preventive component which applies in a more generalized sense to any casework situation.
   We are preventing or averting pathogenic phenomena such_as undue regression , unhealthy suppression and repression , excessive use of denial , and crippling guilt turned against the self.
   While some suppression and some denial are not_only necessary but healthy , the worker 's clinical knowledge must determine how these defenses are being used , what healthy shifts in defensive adaptation are indicated , and when efforts at bringing_about change can be most effectively timed.
     In steering the family toward ego-adaptive and away from maladaptive responses , the worker uses time-honored focused casework techniques of specific emotional support , clarification , and anticipatory guidance.
   Over a relatively short period_of_time , usually about four to twelve weeks , the worker must be able to shift the focus , back_and_forth , between immediate external stressful exigencies (  precipitating stress  ) and the key , emotionally relevant issues (  underlying problem  ) which are , often in a dramatic preconscious breakthrough , reactivated by the crisis situation , and hence once_again amenable to resolution.
   Though there is obviously nothing new about these techniques , they do challenge the worker 's skill to articulate them precisely on_the_spot and on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic assessments.
   Then , too , the utmost clinical flexibility is necessary in judiciously combining carefully timed family-oriented home visits , single and group office interviews , and appropriate telephone follow-up calls , if the worker is to be genuinely accessible and if the predicted unhealthy outcome is to be actually averted in_accordance_with the principles of preventive intervention.
   In_addition , in many cases , a variety of concrete social resources - homemaker , day_care , medical and financial_aid - must be reasonably available for the reality support needed to bolster the family in its individual and collective coping and integrative efforts.
   At certain critical stages , and only for sound diagnostic reasons , it may be important to accompany family members in their use of these resources if their problem-solving behavior is to be constructive rather_than defeating.
   While expensive in_time and involving a great_deal of adaptation on the part of the worker ( in_terms_of his willingness to leave the sanctity of his office and enter actively into the client 's life ) , techniques of accompaniment were found to be of tremendous value when in the service of specific preventive objectives.
   Finally , whatever the techniques used , a twin goal is common to all preventive casework service : to cushion or reduce the force of the stress impact while at_the_same_time to encourage and support family members to mobilize and use their ego capacities.
     Having outlined an approach to the theory and practice of preventive casework , we now address ourselves to our final question : What place should brief , crisis-oriented preventive casework occupy in our total spectrum of services?
   We should first recognize our tendency to develop a hierarchy of values , locating brief treatment at the bottom and long-term intensive service at the top , instead of seeing the services as part of a continuum , each important in its own right.
   This problem is perhaps as old as social casework itself.
   Almost three decades ago Bertha_Reynolds undertook a study of short-contact interviewing because of her conviction that short-term casework had an important but neglected place in our network of social_services.
   Her conclusion has been borne_out in the experience of many practitioners :    short-contact interviewing is neither a truncated nor a telescoped experience but is of the same essential quality as the so-called intensive case work .
   Thus , casework involving a limited number of interviews is still to be regarded in_terms_of the quality of service rendered rather_than of the quantity of time expended.
     That we are experiencing an upsurge of interest in the many formulations and preventive adaptations of brief treatment in social casework is evident from even a small sampling of current literature.
   Especially noteworthy is Levinger 's finding that the length of treatment per_se is not a reliable indicator of successful outcome.
   According to a_number_of studies , the important predictors are the nature and management of the client 's anxiety as_well as the accessibility of the helping person.
   For_example , the level of improvement noted in a recent experiment with a short course of immediate treatment for parent-child relationship problems compared favorably with the results reported by typical child guidance clinics where the hours spent in purely diagnostic study may equal or exceed the number of hours devoted to actual treatment interviews in the experimental project.
   Of startling significance , too , is the assertion that it was possible to carry_out this program with only a 6 percent attrition_rate as compared with a rate of 59 percent reported for a comparable group of families who were receiving help in traditionally operated child guidance services.
   These reports refer to a_level of secondary prevention in a child guidance clinic approached by the customary route of voluntary referral by the family or by other professional people.
   Similarities to the approach which I have described are evident in the prompt establishment of a helping relationship , quick appraisal of key issues , and the immediate mobilization of treatment plans as the essential dynamics in helping to further the ego 's coping efforts in dealing with the interplay of inner and outer stresses.
   While there are many different possibilities for the timing of casework intervention , the experiments recently reported from a variety of traditional settings all point_up the importance of an immediate response to the client 's initial need for help.
   In some programs , treatment is concentrated over a short period_of_time , while in others , after the initial contact is established , flexible spacing of interviews has been experimentally used with apparent success.
   Willingness to take the risk of early and direct interpretation ( with the proviso that if the interpretation is too threatening , the worker can withdraw ) is another prominent feature in these efforts.
   My aim in mentioning this factor obviously is not to give license to  wild therapy  but rather to encourage us to use the time-honored clinical casework skills we already possess , and to use them with greater confidence , precision , and professional pride.
     Though there is obviously great need for continued experimentation with various types of short-term intervention to further efforts in developing an operational definition of prevention at the secondary - or perhaps , in some instances , primary - level , the place of short-term intervention has already been documented by a_number_of investigators in a wide variety of settings.
   Woodward , for_example , has emphasized the  need for a broad spectrum of services , including very brief services in connection with critical situations .
   Ideally , brief treatment should be arrived_at as a treatment of choice rather_than as a treatment of chance.
   Moreover , the shortage of treatment resources and the chronically persistent shortage of mental_health manpower force us to innovate additional refinements of preventive intervention techniques to make services more widely available - and on a more effective basis to more people.
   Further research in the meaning of crises as experienced by the consumers of traditional social casework services - including attempts to develop a typology of family structures , crisis problems , reaction mechanisms , and differential treatment approaches - and the establishment of new experimental programs are imperative social needs which should command the best efforts of caseworkers in_collaboration with community planners.
     our literature is already replete with a fantastic number of suggestions for preventive agency programming ranging from the immediately practical to the globally utopian.
   Probably , in the immediate future , we will have to settle for middle-range efforts that fall_short_of utopian models.
   Increased experimentation with multipurpose agencies , especially those that combine afresh the traditional functions of family and child_welfare_services , holds rich promise for the future.
   For_example , child welfare experience abounds with cases in_which the parental request for substitute care is precipitated by a crisis event which is meaningfully linked with a fundamental unresolved problem of family_relationships.
    
    Tension management and communication of sentiment are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment or feeling.
   One of the devices for tension management is preferential mating.
   The preferential mating of_this particular population has been analyzed in a separate study.
   The relative geographical isolation of the Brandywine population makes_for a limited choice in mating.
   It would seem necessary that members of_this population provide support for one another since it is not provided by the larger society.
   The supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and social isolation.
   The newlyweds building homes on the same land with either set of parents , and the almost exclusive use of members of the population as sponsors for baptisms and weddings illustrate this supportive relationship.
   As Loomis remarks ,  In the internal pattern the chief reason for interacting is to communicate liking , friendship , and love among those who stand in supporting relations_to one another and corresponding negative sentiments to those who stand in antagonistic relations .
     Maintenance of the status_quo might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of_this population today.
   Yet , the object of the element of achieving through the process of goal attaining for this population appears to have been changed by circumstances brought_about by the war.
   Prior to World_War 2 , there was a higher percentage of endogamous marriages than after World_war 2 ,.
     The norms , as elements , refer to  all criteria for judging the character or conduct of both individual and group_actions in any social_system .
   The process of evaluation assigns varying positive and negative priorities or values to elements.
   The elements and processes become evident in a study of mate selection in_this population.
   From the evidence  it may be conjectured that core-core marriages are the preferred unions for core males and females ; core-marginal marriages still belong in the category of permissive unions ; and core-Negro marriages are proscribed for core members .
     The element of status-roles and associated processes have not been sufficiently investigated for this population to permit any type of conjectures about them.
     There is some indication from a limited number of interviews with members of the population that the element of power , primarily the voluntary influence of non-authoritative power , has been exerted on actors in the system , particularly in regard_to mate selection.
   This would seem to vary from family to family , depending somewhat on the core or marginal  status  of_that family.
   Again , size of the group may have some influence on the strength of group controls.
     Interviews with members of the Brandywine population were attempted in_order_to discover the ranking of the various families in the population.
   The large majority of the interviewees placed core families in the upper positions.
   Loomis considers ranking a product of the evaluation process.
    The standing or rank of an actor in a given social_system is determined by the evaluation placed upon the actor and his acts in_accordance_with the norms and standards of the system .
   Despite the increasing rate of exogamous marriages , the population has been able to sustain , at_least to_some_degree , the consciousness of its intermediate status in society.
   To_some_extent the system can be considered a Gemeinschaft in_which  social-role occupancies are determined by birth , by attributes such_as sex or caste , which are biologically or socially immutable .
   The adherence of many in the population to the Indian background in their pedigree , and emphasis upon the fact that their ancestors had never been slaves , becomes of prime interest in determining how far these elements promote the self-image of the intermediate status of the group in society.
     The negative sanctions applied to core-Negro marriages for core members act_as indicators of expected adherence to group norms.
   However , because of Church laws , lately more stringently enforced , which forbid the marriage of cousins closely related consanguineously , a means of facilitating the goal of in-group relations may be that of recourse to illegitimate unions.
   A cursory survey of available material indicates a high rate of illegitimate births occurring to parents who have a close consanguineous relationship.
     The comprehensive or master processes activate all or some of the elements within the social_system and subsystems.
   Within the larger social_system are the structural and functional subsystems.
   The structural subsystem , consisting_of relatively stable inter-relationships among its parts , includes.
     Subgroups of various types , interconnected by relational norms.
     Roles of various types , within the larger system and within the subgroups.
     Regulative norms governing subgroups and roles.
     Cultural values.
     In the study of marriage patterns for this group , consanguinity produces the structural system - a system of affinities - which , in_turn , maintains the system of consanguinity.
   Subgroups of various types have been found within this system.
   Each family_line can be considered a substructure.
   There seems to be an implied cultural value attached_to the fact of core status within the group.
   Additionally , the proscription of core-Negro marriages for core families , discussed above , would seem to act_as a regulative norm governing subgroups and roles.
   The scope of_this study does not provide_for the study of roles of various types within the larger system or within the subgroups.
   However , it cannot be presumed , informal though the structure of the population seems , that there are not well-defined roles within the system.
     The present study relates to the theory of functional systems.
   It is hypothesized that fertility is a function of the social_system when the population as_a_whole is considered and a function of the subsystems when the two-fold division of core families and marginal families is considered.
   The four functional problems of a social_system are , to_some_extent , solved by the subsystems within this population.
   By means of geographical isolation and high fertility_rates , inbreeding can be fostered and the pattern of isolation from the greater society maintained.
   In_order_to attain the goal of group solidarity and to relieve tension , the high fertility_rate provides more group members for mate selection , and the clustering of members in groups fosters acceptance of group controls.
   To maintain their intermediate position in the larger society , it is not_only necessary that members of_this population be  visible  , but that their numbers be great enough to be recognized as a separate , distinct grouping or system in society.
   As mentioned above , where families are concentrated in larger numbers , group controls seem strongest and most effective.
   Adaptation to the social and non-social environment through the economy has been met to a degree through a type of occupational segregation.
   This provides the necessary contact with the larger society , while supporting a type of control over members in_terms_of social contacts.
     Integration  has to do with the inter-relation of parts .
   The problem of solidarity and morale again involves the concept of values.
   The values placed by the Brandywine population , upon maintaining a certain homogeneity , a certain separate racial identity , and therefore a certain separate social_status , are important for the morale of the system.
   Since morale is closely related to pattern maintenance and integration , the higher the morale and solidarity , the better the system can solve the problems of the system.
   In_this respect it would seem that the greater the social distance between the Brandywine population and the white and Negro populations within the same general locality , the greater the possibility for higher morale and solidarity within the Brandywine population.
   It is conceived that one of the means to attain this social distance is that of physical and social isolation.
   In_turn , higher fertility_rates for this population provide a means of increasing the numerical_quantity of the population , allowing_for the possibility of greater stability and unity.
   The population can thereby replenish itself and actually grow larger.
     Of particular utility in the analysis of the development , persistence , and change of social_systems has been the use of the master or comprehensive processes.
   Loomis considers six such processes in his paradigm.
     1.
     Communication 2.
     Boundary maintenance 3.
     Systemic linkage 4.
     Socialization 5.
     Social_control 6.
   Institutionalization Though undoubtedly all six processes are operative within the whole social_system and its subsystems , two processes that are of crucial importance to this study will be singled_out for particular emphasis :     In discussing the process of communication , Loomis defines it as  the process by which information , decisions , and directives are transmitted among actors and the ways in_which knowledge , opinions , and attitudes are formed , or modified by interaction .
   Communication may be facilitated by means of the high visibility within the larger community.
   Intense interaction is easier where segregated living and occupational segregation mark_off a group from the rest of the community , as in the case of_this population.
   However , the factor of physical isolation is not a static situation.
   Although the Brandywine population is still predominantly rural ,  there are indications of a consistent and a statistically significant trend away from the older and relatively isolated rural communities & & & urbanization appears to be an important factor in the disintegration of_this group.
   This conclusion is , however , an over-simplification.
   A more realistic analysis must take_into_account the fact that Brandywine people in the urban-fringe area are , in_general , less segregated locally than group members in rural_areas.
   In the urban_area , in_other_words , they , unlike some urban ethnic_groups , do not concentrate in ghetto colonies.
   Group pressures toward conformity are slight or non-existent , and deviant behavior in mate selection incurs few if any social sanctions.
   In such a setting social contacts and associations are likely to be heterogamous , resulting in a change of values and almost necessarily , in mate selection behavior.
   To the extent that urban life contributes to the breakdown of the group patterns of residential isolation , to_that_extent it contributes directly to increased exogamy .
     The process of social_control is operative insofar as sanctions play a part in the individual 's behavior , as_well as the group 's behavior.
   By means of_this social_control , deviance is either eliminated or somehow made compatible with the function of the social_group.
   Examples from this population indicate that deviance seems to be sanctioned by ostracism from the group.
     There is an oral tradition among the members of the population in regard_to the origin and subsequent separate status of the group in the larger society.
   Confused and divided though this tradition may be , it is an important part of the social and cultural heritage of the group , and acts_as a means of socialization , particularly for members of the rural community.
   The fact of Indian ancestry and  free  status during the days of slavery , are important distinctions made by members of the group.
      Culturally induced social cohesion resulting from common norms and values internalized by members of the group  is operative in the boundary maintenance of the group as_well as in the process of socialization.
   The process of boundary maintenance identifies and preserves the social_system or subsystems , and the characteristic interaction is maintained.
   As the threat of encroachment on the system increases , the  probability of applied boundary maintenance mechanisms increases .
     The fertility_rate pattern would seem to be a function , though a latent one , of the process of maintaining the boundary.
    Increased boundary maintenance may be achieved , for_example , by assigning a higher primacy or evaluation to activities characteristic of the external pattern .
   The external pattern or external system can be considered as  group behavior that enables the group to survive in its environment .
   Boundary maintenance for this group would seem to be primarily social , as is the preference for endogamy.
   It is also expressed in the proscription against deviants in the_matter of endogamy , particularly in rural_areas.
   By their pattern of endogamy and exogamy , the core families and the marginal families show distinct limits to the intergroup contact they maintain.
     Where boundary maintenance describes the boundaries or limits of the group , systemic linkage is defined  as the process whereby one or more of the elements of at_least two social_systems is articulated in such a manner that the two systems in some ways and on some occasions may be viewed_as a single unit.
    
    A royal decree issued in 1910 , two years after the Belgian government assumed authority for the administration of the Congo , prescribed the registration of all adult_males by chiefdoms.
   Further decrees along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919.
   In 1922 a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance of the Governor-General , and the periodic compilation of these records was ordered.
   But specific procedures for carrying_out this plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors.
   A unified set of regulations , applicable to all areas , was issued in 1929 , and a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was instituted at_the_same_time.
   The whole system was again reviewed and reorganized in 1933.
   General responsibility for its administration rested with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor supply and native affairs , Service_des_Affaires_Indigenes et de la Main-d ' Oeuvre ( AIMO , Direction , Direction_Generale , Gouvernement_Generale ).
   Tribal authorities , the chiefs and their secretaries , were held responsible_for maintaining the registers of indigenous persons within their territories , under the general supervision of district officials.
   The district officials , along with their other duties , were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in selected areas and to supervise the annual tabulations of demographic statistics.
     The regulations require the inscription of each individual ( male or female , adult or child ) on a separate card ( fiche ).
   The cards , filed by circonscription ( sub-chiefdom , or village ) , are kept in the headquarters of each territoire ( chiefdom ).
   Each card is expected to show certain information about the individual concerned , including his or her date of birth ( or age at a specified time ) , spouses , and children.
   Additional entries must be made from_time_to_time.
   Different cards are used for males and females , and a corner is clipped from the cards of adults , and of children when they reach puberty.
   So a quick count could be made at_any_time , even by an illiterate clerk , of the number of registered persons in four age-and-sex classes.
   Personal identification cards are issued to all adult_males on_which tax payments , inoculations , periods of employment , and changes of residence are recorded.
   Similar identification cards were issued in 1959 to all adult_females.
   Each adult is held personally responsible_for assuring his inscription and obtaining an identification card which must be shown on demand.
   The registration card of a person leaving his home_territory for a short period is put into a special file for absent persons.
   The cards of permanent out-migrants are , in_theory , sent to an office in the place of new residence.
   Finally , the registration of births and deaths by nearest relatives was made compulsory in most regions.
     Numbers of registered persons in four age-and-sex classes were counted each_year.
   In_addition , demographic inquiries , supposedly involving field investigations , were conducted in selected minor divisions ( circonscriptions ) containing about 3 percent of the total population.
   The results of these inquiries were used to adjust compilations of data from the registers and to provide various ratios and rates by districts , including birth and death_rates , general fertility_rates , distributions by marital_status , fertility of wives separately in polygynous and non-polygynous households , infant mortality , and migration.
   The areas to be examined in these inquiries were selected by local officials , supposedly as representative of a larger population.
   Averages of the ratios obtained in a_few selected areas were applied to the larger population.
     The scheme , in_theory , is an ingenious adaptation of European registration systems to the conditions of African life.
   But it places a severe strain on the administrative resources ( already burdened in_other_ways ) of a widely dispersed , poor and largely illiterate population.
   The sampling program was instituted before the principles of probability sampling were widely recognized in population studies.
   The system was not well adapted to conditions of life in urban_centers.
   The distinction between domiciled ( de_jure ) and present ( de_facto ) population was not clearly defined.
   So the results are subject to considerable confusion.
   The system tended to break_down during the war , but was reactivated ; it had reached the pre-war level of efficiency by 1951.
   In_spite_of the defects in_this system , the figures on total population during the late 1930 's and again in the early 1950 's seem to have represented actual conditions in most districts with approximate fidelity.
   But the information on the dynamics of population was often quite misleading.
     The same system , with minor modifications , was developed in Ruanda-Urundi under Belgian administration.
   Here again it seems that useful approximations of the size and geographical distribution of the population were obtained in_this_way in the late pre-war and early post-war periods.
     Before considering more recent activities , we should note another important aspect of demography in Belgian Africa.
   A_number_of strong independent agencies , established in some cases with governmental or royal support , have conducted large medical , social , educational and research operations in_particular parts of the Congo and Ruanda-Urundi.
   The work of Fonds_Reine_Elisabeth pour l ' Assistance_Medicale aux Indigenes_du_Congo_Belge ( FOREAMI ) has special interest with_respect_to demography.
   This agency accepted responsibility for medical services to a population ranging from 638560 persons in 1941 to 840503 in 1956 in the Kwango_District and adjacent areas east of Leopoldville.
   Each_year from 1941 on , its medical staff had conducted intensive field investigations to determine changes in population structure and vital rates and , as its primary objective , the incidence of major diseases.
   Its findings are reported each_year in its Rapport sur l ' activite pendant annee ( Bruxelles ).
   Somewhat similar investigations have been made by medical_officers in other areas.
   Other independent , or partially independent agencies , have promoted investigations on topics directly or indirectly related_to demography.
   These studies vary widely in scope and precision.
   L ' Institut pour la Recherche_Scientifique en Afrique_Centrale ( IRSAC ) has sponsored well-designed field investigations and has cooperated closely with the government of Ruanda-Urundi in the development of its official statistics.
     A massive investigation of the characteristics of in-migrants and prospective out-migrants in Ruanda-Urundi is being carried_on by J._J._Maquet , former Director of the Social_Science branch of IRSAC , now a professor at l ' Universite_Officielle_du_Congo_Belge et du_Ruanda-Urundi.
   Some 30000 completed schedules with 20 items ( collected by sub-chiefs in 1100 circumscriptions ) have been tabulated.
   The results are now being analyzed.
     Statistics have been recognized as a matter of strategic importance in the Congo and in Ruanda-Urundi during the post-war years in connection with long-term economic and social programs.
   The AIMO organizations of both countries , which maintain administrative services throughout the territories , retained immediate responsibility for the collection and publication of demographic information.
   However , the statistical offices of both governments were assigned responsibility for the planning and analysis of these statistics.
   A Bureau de la Demographie ( A._Romaniuk , Director ) was formed under AIMO in the Congo , to work in close rapport with the Section Statistique of the Secretariat_General.
   Eventually responsibility for demographic inquiries in the Congo was transferred to the demographic division of the Central_Statistical_Office.
   The 1952 demographic inquiry in Ruanda-Urundi was directed by V._Neesen , a member of the IRSAC staff , though the inquiry was carried_out under the auspices of AIMO , which has continuing responsibility for demographic statistics in_this territory.
   A member of the IRSAC staff ( E._van de Walle ) was recently delegated to cooperate with AIMO in the development of demographic statistics in_this territory.
     The initiation of sampling censuses in Ruanda-Urundi ( 1952 ) and in the Congo ( 1955 - 57 ) were major advances.
   We will deal first with the program in the Congo though this was put into operation later than the other.
     The radical nature of the innovation in the Congo was not emphasized in the official announcements.
   The term enquetes demographiques , previously used for the supplementary investigations carried_out in connection with the administrative censuses , was used for the new investigations.
   However , the differences in procedure are fundamental.
   These are as_follows :     Field operations were transferred from administrative personnel primarily engaged in other tasks to specially trained teams of full-time African investigators ( three teams , each working in two provinces ).
   These teams carried_out the same operations successively in different areas.
     Sample areas in the new investigations were selected strictly by application of the principles of probability_theory , so_as_to be representative of the total population of defined areas within calculable limits.
   In_short , scientific sampling was introduced in_place of subjective sampling.
   The populations of the various districts , or other major divisions , were stratified by type of community ( rural , urban , mixed ) and , where appropriate , by ethnic affiliation and by type of economy.
   Sample units ( villages in rural_areas , houses in cities ) were drawn systematically within these strata.
     Different sampling ratios were applied under different conditions.
   Higher proportions were sampled in urban and mixed communities than in rural_areas.
   About 11 percent of the total population was covered in the new investigation , as compared with about 3 percent in the previous inquiries.
     Uniform questions , definitions , and procedures were enforced throughout the whole country.
   Data were obtained , separately , on three classes of persons : ( a ) residents , present ; ( b ) residents , absent ; and ( c ) visitors.
   In the reports , summary results are given for both the de_facto ( a and c ) and de_jure ( a and b ) populations ; but the subsequent analysis of characteristics is reported only for the de_jure population ( or , in some districts , only the de_facto population ).
     These changes represent in_effect , a shift from ( 1 ) an administrative compilation of data obtained through procedures designed primarily to serve political and economic objectives to ( 2 ) a systematic sampling census of the whole African population.
     The population registration system still has important functions.
   It supplies local data which are useful in administration and which can be used as a basis for intensive studies in_particular situations.
   It provides a frame for the sampling census.
   It also provides a frame within which the registration of vital events is gradually gaining force ( though one cannot expect to obtain reliable vital statistics in most parts of the Congo from this source in the near future ).
   It is still used in making current population estimates in post-census years , though the value of these estimates is open_to question.
   Finally , it may have certain very important , less obvious values.
   Even_though the registers may have an incomplete record of persons present in a particular area or include persons no_longer living there , they contain precise information on ages , by date of birth , for some of the persons present ( especially children in relatively stable communities ) and supplementary information ( such_as records of marital_status ) for many others.
   The quality of the census data can , therefore , be greatly improved by the use of the registration records in conjunction with the field inquiries.
   Furthermore , it may be possible to estimate the error due_to bias in method ( as distinguished from sampling error ) in each of these sources , on such subjects as fertility , mortality , and migration during a given interval by using information from two largely independent sources in conjunction.
     The first sampling census in the Congo extended over a three-year period , 1955 - 57 ; the results were still being processed in 1959.
   It is planned to double the number of teams and to make use of improved equipment in a second demographic inquiry in 1960 , so_that the inquiry can be carried_through in one year and the results published more expeditiously.
   It is proposed that in_the_future complete sampling censuses be carried_out at five-year intervals.
     Reports already issued on the sampling census , 1955 - 57 , in various areas run as_follows ( using only the_French and omitting corresponding Flemish titles ) :.
     This report contains preliminary notes and 35 tables.
     Other reports in identical form , but with somewhat varying content , have been issued for :.
     These area reports will be followed , according to present plans , by a summary report , which will include a detailed statement on methods.
    
    With this evidence in mind , the writer began to plan how he might more effectively educate the married students in his functional classes.
   Toward the end of the semester 's work , he interviewed every married class member at_great_length.
   He found , as he had suspected , a general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally designed course was not really functional for these students.
   However , all admitted that the  hind sight  was not altogether lost.
   In their own words , it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they had gotten_into their marriages , and perhaps they had obtained some insights on why certain troubles appeared from_time_to_time.
   In_fact , they went so_far as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design a section exclusively for married students there should be , at the beginning , some  hind sight  study ; but they all hastened to add that certainly less time was needed on_it than presently spent.
   All_of them felt a compelling need for more coverage on areas that could be only lightly touched_upon in a general survey functional course.
     A_few were doubtful about the merits of an exclusive section for married students.
   As one of them expressed it ,  It has done me a world of good to listen to the nai ^ ve questions and comments of these not-yet-married people.
   I can now better see just what processes provoked certain actions from me in_the_past.
   Had I been in an all-married section I would have missed this , and I believe that this single aspect has been of great personal value to me .
   This comment and_others similar to_it , would seem to indicate a possible justification for continuing the status_quo.
   But the weight of feeling was heavily in_the_opposite_direction.
   Thus , the writer decided to hold one experimental section of the functional preparation for marriage course in the spring semester of 1960 exclusively for persons already married - that_is , prerequisite :  marriage .
   This did not mean that married students could not enroll in other  mixed  sections , and some of them , largely because of scheduling difficulties , did.
   But only those already married could enroll in_this one section.
   In_addition , two other differences in the two types of sections must be noted.
   1 ) The regular sections do not allow freshmen ; this one did.
   This action was rationalized on the basis of a small survey which indicated that a high percentage of married freshmen women on our campus never become sophomores.
   Many_of them appear to drop_out , for one reason or another.
   By permitting freshman students we might extend the opportunity for such a course to some individuals who otherwise might never get to take it.
   This has subsequently been verified by the experience.
   2 ) Auditors were encouraged.
   In the regular sections they have always been more_or_less discouraged.
   The philosophy has been that if they could find the time to attend class why not encourage them to get the credit and perhaps provide an incentive to do the work more effectively.
   Besides , auditors do not count on faculty load with the same weight as regularly enrolled students.
   But in_this one section we welcomed auditors.
   Why?
   For no particular reason , other_than that the writer felt it might - just might - encourage both mates to be in_attendance.
   Many_of the men on our campus have a pretty set curriculum , especially in the various engineering fields , with few electives till the senior year.
   Incidentally , it needs to be noted that because auditors were permitted the section began increasing in numbers each_week , until at_last it swelled to such proportions that this  free  auditing policy had to be retracted.
   After_that , we began to get  visitors  to class.
     This experimental class represented quite a variety of students.
   It ranged from a freshman woman , just married , through the various academic growth stages , including one senior-graduate student , to a young faculty_member recently married to a senior man who also attended.
   It ranged from those with no children , through students in various stages of pregnancy , to one 44 - year-old male with four children , three of whom were teenagers.
   It ranged from two women members who had experienced premarital pregnancy to one couple twelve years married and seemingly unable to conceive.
     One might digress at this point and speculate that if it is  wise  to create special sections for special status , then why not a special section for women pregnant before marriage , and one for 44 - year-old men with teenage children , and_so_on.
   Some of these speculations may have some merit , others are somewhat ambiguous.
   But few who have experienced marriage can dispute the fact that the focus of interpersonal relationships is different in marriage than in a pre-marital situation.
     The writer began this special class by explaining his background thinking for creating such a section in_the_first_place.
   He made it clear from_the_beginning that this was the students ' opportunity , and that the future destiny of such groups depended_on favorable results from this one.
   He did build a framework of academic  respectability  , and one which did not encroach_upon the  sacred sovereignty  of any other existing campus course.
   This is to say that this was not a course in wise buying or money spending methods , nor a course in how to raise children.
   We already have courses covering those problems , and_so_on.
   But within that framework he allowed_for as much flexibility as possible.
   A steering_committee of students was organized on the first day whose duty it was to be alert and constantly evaluate and re-evaluate the direction and pace the class was taking.
   The writer , being cognizant through his interviews of the reactions of previous married students , did insist on there being included some  hind sight  material.
   But the greater part of semester time was actually centered around the attitudes  So we are married - now how do we make the best of_it ?
 or  How do we enrich our already fine marriage ?
     Films were used , as with all sections , but with one big difference.
   Our campus , unfortunately , owns no films.
   Since they are all either rented or borrowed , the requested dates for their use have to be far in_advance.
   The writer never knew from week to week just where the section might be.
   For_example , the steering_committee might announce that the group felt a topic under study should not be dropped for an additional week as there was still too_much of_it untouched.
   Since the writer had established this democratic procedure in_the_beginning he had to go_along with their decision - after , of_course , pointing_out whether he thought their decision was a wise or an unwise one.
   Thus the films seen as they came_in ( coordinated for the regular sections ) , were often out of context.
   Nevertheless , the writer has never experienced such spontaneity of discussion after film showings.
     Though it did not become known to the writer for_some_time , a nucleus group had sprung_up within the class.
   They began to meet in the evenings and carry_forward various discussions they felt not fully enough covered in class.
   From a_few students this group gradually increased to include over three-fourths of those officially enrolled in the class , and many outsiders as_well.
   Also , although only a_few of the students were intimately acquainted_with each other in_the_beginning , most reported that when the semester ended their dearest and closest campus friendships were with members of_that class.
   In_fact , they often revamped their social_activities to include class members previously unknown.
     Supplemental outside reading reports were handled just_as in the other sections , the major difference being that there was a noticeably deeper level in the reported outside reading by the married group.
   These students , although they might read various articles in popular magazines , more_often chose to report on articles found in the journals.
   In_addition to the noticeable difference in outside articles , there was a considerable difference in the outside books they read.
   Whereas a high per_cent of the regular students can be expected to read other texts which more_or_less plow the same ground in a_little different direction , the married students chose whole books on specific areas and went into much greater detail in their areas of interest.
   Since the writer had not noticed this characteristic in married students scattered throughout the various sections previous to this experiment , nor , as_a_matter_of_fact , in those who were continuing in  single sections  , he can only conclude that there must have been something  contagious  within the specific group which caused this to occur.
     In_the_main , this course took the following directional high roads : 1 ) A great_deal of time was spent on processes for solving marital differences.
   This was not a search for a  magic formula  , but rather an examination of basic_principles pertaining especially to all types of communication in marriage.
   In_short , it was centered around learning how to develop a more sensitive empathy.
   Not until the group was satisfied in_this area were they willing to venture further to 2 ) Specific adjustment areas , such_as sex , in-laws , religion , finance , and_so_on.
   From here they proceeded to 3 ) These same areas in_relation_to their own future family life stages , developing these to the extent of examining various crises which could be expected to confront them at_some_time or other.
     As an example of_this last facet , there were some lengthy discussions centered around bereavement.
   Mainly these were concerned with the possibility of the death of one parent and the complication of living with the survivor afterward , but the possible death of one 's own spouse was not overlooked.
   Since the course , one member has lost her husband.
   This was not a particularly shocking or unexpected thing - it was previously known to her that it might happen.
   But just when was an unknown , and of_course the longer it did not happen , the stronger her wish and belief that it might not.
   Since her bereavement this individual has reported to the writer on numerous occasions about how helpful the class discussions were to her in_this adjustment crisis.
     Quite frequently class members brought questions from their mates at_home.
   These were often carefully written out with a great_deal of thought behind them.
   This added a personal zest to class discussions and participation.
     Both sexes reported that the discussions on sex adjustment within marriage were extremely enlightening.
   The writer sensed a much freer and more frank discussion , especially of_this one area , than ever before.
   He felt certain for_the_first_time in his teaching experience that the men in the class understood that orgasm , as a criterion , is not_nearly so essential for a satisfying female sexual experience as most males might think.
   This was probably much more meaningful because all the women in the class emphasized it time_and_again.
   On_the_other_hand , the women class members appeared to reach a far greater understanding than have women members in other sections that it is more natural for males as_a_group to view sex as sex rather_than always associating it with_love as most women seem to do.
     in the reproductive area it could be readily observed that all felt freer to discuss things than students had previously in  mixed  marital_status sections.
   Perhaps this was related to the fact that all were in on_it to_some_extent.
   Never in other sections has there been the opportunity for the genuine down-to-earth discussions about the feelings of both spouses during various stages of pregnancy.
   There was a particularly marvelous opportunity for study in_this area since almost every stage of pregnancy was represented , from a childless couple to and including every trimester.
   In_fact , we had one birth before the end of the course , and another student had_to take the final examiantion a week early , just to be on the safe side.
   There was also one spontaneous abortion during the semester.
    
    Thus it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief  structuring  experience.
     It was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative subjects would adhere to more liberal , concretistic reports of_what the ambiguous figure  looked_like  as reflecting their hesitancy about taking_chances.
   This was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people in action.
   Responses such_as  rope with a loop in it  , and  two pieces of rope  , were quite characteristic.
     The three personality inventories ( Guilford_STDCR ; Guilford-Martin_GAMIN ; Guilford-Martin_OAGCo ) , were filled_out by 12 of the Kohnstamm-positive subjects and 19 of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects.
   These were the same subjects who were given the Rorschach test.
   Some predictions had been made concerning factors R , N , I and Co on these inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security aspects of personality functioning which were hypothesized as being of importance in differential Kohnstamm reactivity.
     Only Co differentiated between the two groups at less_than the 5 % level ( * * f ).
     One prediction had been made about the difference in security or self-confidence between those subjects who shifted their Kohnstamm reactivity when informed and those who did not.
   The nonreactors had been separated into two groups on this assumption with the presumably  secure  nonreactors and  secure  reactors being used as the groups for comparative personality studies.
   It was predicted that those who shifted in their Kohnstamm reactivity would differ significantly from those who did not on the factor I which the investigators refer to as the  Inferiority  factor.
   All_of the subjects in the Kohnstamm-negative and Kohnstamm-positive groups ( as defined for purposes of the personality studies ) were compared with those subjects who shifted in Conditions 3 , or 4 ,.
   A t test on these two groups , shifters vs. nonshifters , gave a  t  value of 2.405 which is significant on the two-tail test at the.
028 level.
     Individual differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to controlled Kohnstamm situations were found among the subjects used in the study.
   Only 27 % ( 11 subjects ) gave a positive Kohnstamm reaction when completely nai ^ ve concerning the phenomenon.
   There were 49 % ( 20 subjects ) who did not give a positive reaction even after they were informed of the normalcy of such a reaction and had been given a demonstration.
   There were 24 % ( 10 subjects ) who shifted from a negative to a positive reaction after they were reassured as to the normalcy of the Kohnstamm-positive reaction.
     Among this latter group there were also differences in the amount and kind_of information necessary before a shift in reaction occurred.
   One subject changed when given only the information that some people have something happen to their arm when they relax.
   Five subjects ( 12 % ) did not change until they had been told that some people have something happen to their arm , what that something was , and also were given a demonstration.
   Four subjects ( 10 % ) did not change even then but needed the additional information that an arm-elevation under these circumstances was a perfectly normal reflex reaction which some people showed while others did not.
   At_no_time was it implied by the experimenter that the subject 's initial reaction was deviant.
   The subjects were only given information about other possibilities of  normal  reaction.
   Those who responded with an arm-elevation in the nai ^ ve state did not change their reaction when told that there were some normal people who did not react in_this fashion.
   This information was accepted with the frequent interpretation that those persons who did not show arm-levitation must be preventing it.
   These subjects implied that they too could prevent their arms from rising if they tried.
     The positive Kohnstamm reactivity in_Condition 1 , ( the nai ^ ve state ) is not adequately explained by such a concept as suggestibility ( if suggestibility is defined as the influence on behavior by verbal cues ).
   In_no_way , either verbally or behaviorally , did the experimenter indicate to the subjects any preferred mode of responding to the voluntary contraction.
   Moreover , when the experimenter did inform those subjects that there were some normal people who did not have their arm rise once they relaxed , the Kohnstamm-positive subjects were uninfluenced in their subsequent reactions to the Kohnstamm situation.
   They continued to give an arm-elevation.
   A differential suggestibility would have to be invoked to explain the failure of_this additional information to influence the Kohnstamm-positive reactors and yet attribute their nai ^ ve Kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion.
   Autosuggestibility , the reaction of the subject in_such_a_way as to conform_to his own expectations of the outcome ( i. e. , that the arm-rise is a reaction to the pressure exerted in the voluntary contraction , because of his knowledge that  to every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction  ) also seems inadequate as an explanation for the following reasons : ( 1 ) the subjects ' apparently genuine experience of surprise when their arms rose , and ( 2 ) manifestations of the phenomenon despite anticipations of something else happening ( e._g. , of becoming dizzy and maybe falling , an expectation spontaneously volunteered by one of the subjects ).
     A suggestion hypothesis also seems inadequate as an explanation for those who shifted their reactions after they were informed of the possibilities of  normal  reactions different from those which they gave.
   While they were told that there were some normal people who reacted differently than they had , they were also informed that there were other normals who reacted as they had.
   There was no implication made that their initial reaction ( absence of an arm-elevation ) was less preferred than the presence of levitation.
   A more tenable explanation for the change in reactions is that the added knowledge and increased familiarity with the total situation made it possible for these subjects to be less guarded and to relax , since any reaction seemed acceptable to the examiner as  normal .
     The nai ^ ve state , Condition 1 , , could therefore be viewed_as an inhibiting one for 24 % of the subjects in_this study.
   They were not free to be themselves in_this situation , an interpersonal one , where there was an observer of their reactions and they had no guide for acceptable behavior.
   Instructions to relax , i. e. , to be  spontaneous  , and react immediately to whatever impulse they might have , was not sufficiently reassuring until some idea of the possibilities of normal reactions had been given.
   While other conditions might be even more effective in bringing_about a change from immobility to mobility in Kohnstamm reactivity , it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would have as a common_factor the capacity to induce an attitude in the subject which enabled him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of responsibility for his behavior.
     Alcohol ingestion succeeded in changing immobility to mobility quite strikingly in one pilot subject ( the only one with whom this technique was tried ).
   This subject , who has been undergoing psychoanalytic psychotherapy for five years , did not give a positive Kohnstamm reaction under any of the four standardized conditions used in_this experiment while sober.
   After two drinks containing alcohol , her arm flew upward very freely.
   There was evident delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of the freedom of movement.
   She described herself as having the same kind_of  irresponsible  feeling as she had once experienced under hypnosis.
   She ascribed her delight with both experiences to the effect they seemed to have of temporarily removing from her the controls which she felt so compulsively necessary to maintain even when it might seem appropriate to relax these controls.
     Many subjects attributed differences in Kohnstamm reactivity to differences in degrees of subjective control - voluntary as the Kohnstamm-positive subjects perceived it and involuntary as the Kohnstamm-negative subjects perceived it.
   These suggested interpretations were given by the subjects spontaneously when they were told that there were people who reacted differently than they had.
   The Kohnstamm-positive subjects described the vivid experience of having their arms rise as one in_which they exercised no control.
   They explained its absence in others on the basis of an intervention of control factors.
   They felt that they too could counteract the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they had once experienced the reaction.
   Some of those who did not initially react with an arm-elevation also associated their behavior in the situation with control factors - an inability to relinquish control voluntarily.
   One subject spontaneously asked ( after her arm had finally risen ) ,  Do you suppose I was unconsciously keeping it down before ?
   Another said that her arm did not go_up at_first  because I would n't let it ; I thought it was n't supposed to .
   This subject was one who gave an arm-elevation on the second trial in the nai ^ ve state but not in the first.
   She had felt that her arm wanted to go_up in the first trial , but had consciously prevented it from so doing.
   She explained nonreactivity of others by saying that they were  not letting themselves relax .
   When informed that there were some persons who did not have their arm go_up , she commented ,  I do n't see how they can prevent it .
   In contrast to this voluntary-control explanation for nonreactivity given by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects , the Kohnstamm-negative subjects offered an involuntary-control hypothesis to explain nonreactivity.
   They felt that they were relaxing as much_as they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent response must be on an unconscious level.
     The above discussion does not mean to imply that control factors were completely in_abeyance in the Kohnstamm-positive subjects ; but rather that they could be diminished sufficiently not to interfere with arm-levitation.
   One Kohnstamm-positive subject who had both arms rise while being tested in the nai ^ ve condition described her subjective experience as_follows :  You feel they 're going_up and you 're on a stage and it 's not right for them to do so and_then you think maybe that 's what 's supposed to happen .
   She then described her experience as one in_which she first had difficulty accepting for herself a state of being in_which she relinquished control.
   However , she was able to relax and yield to the moment.
     It is our hypothesis that Kohnstamm-positive subjects are less hesitant about relinquishing control than are Kohnstamm-negative subjects ; that they can give_up their control and allow themselves to be reactors rather_than actors.
   It is our belief that this readiness to relinquish some control was evidenced by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects in some of the other experimental situations to be discussed below.
   Thus , this readiness to relax controls , evidenced in the Kohnstamm situation , appears to be a more general personality factor.
     The Kohnstamm-positive subjects seemed to be freer to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible in the external world.
   There was a significantly greater number in_this group who reported a desk as being in a tilted position while a tennis_ball resting_on it remained stationary on the incline.
   This occurred in_spite_of the rational awareness that the ball should be going downhill.
   They knew that their perceptual experience differed from objective reality since they had seen the desk and ball prior to putting_on the aniseikonic lenses.
   Yet they were not so bound by past experience and constriction as to deny their immediate perceptions and to be dominated_by their knowledge of_what the experience should be.
   The change in perceptions by some of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects , after they had been informed of the possibilities of normal reactions , suggests that their constriction and guardedness is associated with their general mode of responding to strange or unknown situations.
   They were able to experience at_first , in_terms_of past conventionality.
   When informed as to the various possibilities of normal reactions , they were then able to experience the uniqueness of the present.
   It might be postulated that these subjects are unduly afraid_of being wrong ; that they perceive new internal and environmental situations as  threatening  until they are tested and proved otherwise.
     While the interpretations that have been given are inferences only , they gain support from such comments as the following , which was made by one of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not , on the first trial , perceive the tilt illusion.

    There were thirty-eight patients on the bus the morning I left for Hanover , most_of them disturbed and hallucinating.
   An interne , a nurse and two attendants were in charge of us.
     I felt lonely and depressed as I stared out the bus window at Chicago 's grim , dirty West_Side.
   It seemed incredible , as I listened to the monotonous drone of voices and smelled the fetid odors coming from the patients , that technically I was a ward of the state of Illinois , going_to a hospital for the mentally_ill.
     I suddenly thought_of Mary_Jane Brennan , the way her pretty eyes could flash with_anger , her quiet competence , the gentleness and sweetness that lay just beneath the surface of her defenses.
     We had become good friends during my stay at Cook_County_Hospital.
   I had told her enough about myself to offset somewhat the damaging stories that had appeared in local newspapers after my little adventure in Marshall_Field + Co..
   She knew that I lived at a good address on the Gold_Coast , that I had once been a medical_student and was thinking_of returning to the university to finish my medical studies.
   She knew also that I was unmarried and without a single known relative.
   She was n't quite sure that I felt enough remorse about my drinking , or that I would not return to it once I was out and on my own again.
   This had worried her.
      I read those newspaper stories about you  , she had said.
    You must have loved that girl very_much , but you could n't have meant it when you said that you wanted to kill her .
      Why do you say that ?
   I asked.
    I was full of booze and , well , a drunk is apt to do anything he says he 'll do .
     Nonsense!
   I grew_up in an Irish neighborhood on Chicago 's West_Side.
   Do n't tell me about drunks.
   You 're not the kind to go violent.
   Were you in_love with_that girl ?
      Would it make any difference to you if I were , Mary_Jane ?
     She met my eyes , suddenly angry.
    I would n't have gone into nursing if I did n't care about people.
   I 'm interested in every patient I 've helped take care of.
   When I think_of people like you , well , I  -      You what , Mary_Jane ?
      You are young , intelligent , have a whole lifetime before you to make something worth while of yourself , but you mess it up with whiskey , indifference , self-destructive attitudes.
   I do n't blame that girl for breaking her engagement with you.
   Was she pretty ?
      Oh , yes  , I said , feeling annoyed ,  she was very pretty.
   You do n't believe that I 'm going_back to medical_school and finish , do you ?
      Why should I?
   I 've worked this ward for three months now.
   We keep getting the same ones back again_and_again.
   They all mean well , have great promises to make when they are about to go_home , but drinking is their sickness.
   You 've not seemed like them , but maybe you are.
   You 've treated your stay here like a big joke.
   It 's not a joke to be sent to a place like this or to Hanover.
   I wanted to go_to college , to  -      Why did n't you ?
   I asked.
    Chicago has some of the best  -     Her eyes flashed angrily.
    That 's what I mean about you , Anderson  , she said.
    You do n't seem to know much about reality.
   I 'll tell you why I did n't go_to college ; I 'm the oldest of six children.
   My father 's a policeman and makes less_than seven thousand dollars a year.
   There was no money for tuition , for clothes , for all the things you apparently take_for_granted.
   Nurses ' training here does n't cost anything.
   They even pay me six dollars a month.
   I think it 's a good_deal.
   I 'm going_to become a good nurse , and I 've got two baby brothers that are going_to have college if I have to work_at my profession until I 'm an old_maid to give it to them .
      Do you have a boy friend ?
   I asked.
      That 's none of your business  , she said , then changed the subject.
    What about your father and mother , do n't you think_of them when you 're in a place like this ?
      My father and mother died when I was two years old  , I said.
    My aunt raised me.
   Aunt_Mary died when I was doing my military_service.
   I have no one but myself to worry about .
     Something in my voice must have touched her deeply because her anger passed quickly , and she turned_away to keep me from seeing her face.
      I 'm sorry  , she said.
    I do n't know what I 'd do without my family.
   We 've always been so close .
      Tell me more about them .
     Her eyes became bright as she talked_about her father and mother , aunts and uncles , cousins.
   Listening , I felt cheated and lonely as only an orphan can.
   When she had finished I said :      Your dad sounds like a good father and a good policeman.
   I 'll bet he would n't be pleased if a rumdum like me were to ask his daughter for a date - I mean , after I 'm out of the hospital , a month or_so from now .
      My father is a sergeant of detectives and has been attached to Homicide for five years.
   He 's a pretty good judge of character , Anderson.
   I do n't think he 'd mind too_much if he were sure you 'd decided not to be a rumdum in_the_future .
      What about you?
   How would you feel about it if I were to ask you for a date when I get_through at Hanover ?
      If I thought you were serious about going_back to school , that you 'd learned something from your experiences here and at Hanover - well , I might consider such an offer.
   What about your & & & that girl you were going_to kill ?
     It suddenly seemed very important to me that Mary_Jane Brennan should know the truth about me - that I was not the confused , sick , irresponsible person she believed me to be.
      There are things about me that I can n't tell you now , Mary_Jane  , I said ,  but if you 'll go_out to dinner with me when I get_out of Hanover , I 'd like to tell you the whole story.
   I can say this : I 'm dead serious about going_back to school.
   As for that other girl , let 's just say that I never want to see her again.
   You will get to come home on long weekends from Hanover , won n't you ?
      Yes , I 'll get one overnight a month .
      We 'll go_up to the Edgewater_Beach_Hotel for dinner  , I said.
    Do you like to dance?
   They always have a good orchestra .
      I like to dance  , she said , then turned and walked away.
     There had n't been anything really personal in her interest in me.
   I knew that.
   It was just that she felt deeply about every patient on the ward and wanted to believe that they might benefit from their treatment there.
     Now , riding this hospital bus , feeling isolated and utterly alone , I knew that she was genuine and unique , quite unlike any girl I had known before.
   It seemed the_most important thing in my life at this moment that she should know the real truth about me.
     It was a fantastic story.
   Only two people in the state of Illinois knew that I was entering Hanover_State_Hospital under an assumed_name , or why.
   It was unlikely that any girl as sharp as Mary_Jane Brennan would believe it without proof.
   But I had the proof , all documented in a legal agreement which I would show her the moment I was free to do so.
     As the bus turned into the main highway and headed toward Hanover I settled back in my seat and closed my eyes , thinking_over the events of the past two_weeks , trying to put the pieces in_order.
   I wondered suddenly as I listened to the disconnected jabberings coming from the patient behind me , if I had not perhaps imagined it all.
   Perhaps this was reality and Dale_Nelson , the actor , was delusion ; a figment of Carl_Anderson 's imagination.
     I had come to Chicago from New_York early in September with a dramatic_production called Ask_Tony.
   It was a bad play , real grade-A turkey , which only a prevalence of angels with grandiose dreams of capital_gain and tax money to burn could have put into rehearsal.
   No one , not even the producer , had any real hope of getting it back to Broadway.
   But because it was a suspense gangster story of the Capone era , many_of us felt that it might catch_on for a run in Chicago , continue as a road company , and eventually become a movie.
     Such optimism was completely unjustified.
   The critics literally screamed their indignation.
   Ask_Tony was doomed from the moment Kupcinet leveled on_it in his Sun-Times column.
   We opened on Friday and closed the following Monday.
   Out of the entire cast I alone received good notices for my portrayal of a psychopathic killer.
   This let me in_for a_lot_of kidding from the rest of the company , two members of_which were native Chicagoans.
     We were paid_off Tuesday morning and given tickets back to New_York.
     I felt lonely and depressed as I packed my bags at the Croydon_Hotel.
   It seemed to me that my life was destined to be one brilliant failure after another.
   I had been among the top third in my class at N._Y._U. , had wanted desperately to go_to medical_school , but I 'd run_out of money and energy at_the_same_time.
   Then later I had quit my safe , secure five-a-week spot on a network soap_opera to take a part in_this play.
   It seemed to me that I was not_only unlucky but quite stupid as_well.
   I knew that I 'd soon be back working as an orderly at the hospital or as a counterman at Union_News or Schraffts while waiting for another acting job to open.
   It suddenly occurred to me that I did not particularly like acting , that I was at some sort_of crossroads and would have to decide soon what I was going_to do with my life.
     I closed the last bag and stood all three at the door for the bellboy to pick_up , then went_to the bathroom for a drink of water.
   The telephone rang.
   When I answered it a voice too dignified and British to be real said ,  Is this Mr._Dale_Nelson , the actor ?
      All_right  , I said.
    Why do n't you bastards lay_off for_a_while ?
      I beg your pardon , sir ?
      All_right.
   This is Dale_Nelson , the actor .
      Good.
   I 'm calling you , Mr._Nelson , at the request of Mr._Phillip_Wycoff.
   Could you possibly have lunch with him today?
   His car could pick you up at your hotel at twelve .
     I smiled.
    You 'll send the Rolls-Royce , of_course ?
      Yes , of_course , Mr._Nelson .
     I started to say something else appropriate , but the man had hung_up.
     I finally went downstairs to the bar off the main lobby where most_of the cast were drowning their sorrows over the untimely passing of Ask_Tony.
   They all bowed low as I approached them.
      All_right , you bastards  , I said ,  the great actor is_about to buy a drink .
     I laid a tenspot on the bar and motioned to the bartender to serve a round.
   He had just returned my change when the doorman came_in off the street to page me.
   I walked over to him.
      You Mr._Nelson ?
 he asked.
      That 's right .
      Mr. Wycoff 's car is waiting for you at the east entrance .
     I followed him out through the lobby to the street.
     An ancient Rolls-Royce , as shiningly impressive as the day it came off the ship , was parked at the curb.
   The elderly chauffeur , immaculate in a dark uniform , stood stiffly at attention holding open the door of the town car.
    
    I was giving the parked cars the once-over.
   The Oldsmobile with the license_number JYJ 114 was in stall number five.
      Okay  , I said to the attendant ,  I 'll let you know if I close the deal on the office in_this building .
     I walked with him back to the entrance.
   He gave me a ticket on the agency car and parked it.
     I was back in ten minutes.
    Forgot to get something out of the car  , I told him , showing him my ticket.
     He started to say something as I walked in and_then suddenly grinned and said ,  Oh , yes.
   You 're the one I was talking to about a monthly rental.
      That 's right  , I told him.
     He consulted the parking_ticket , then looked at a notation and said ,  You 're in the third row back toward_the_rear.
   Can you find it all_right ?
      Sure  , I told him.
     I went_back to the agency car and got_out an electric bug , one of the newest devices for electronic shadowing.
   I always keep a set in the car.
     I put_in new batteries so_as_to be certain I 'd have plenty of power and on my way_out walked over to the regular parking stalls and stood looking at them thoughtfully.
     I waited until the parking attendant was busy with a customer , then slipped around the back of the car with license_number JYM 114 , attached the electronic bug to_the_rear bumper and walked_out.
     The attendant waved me on.
     One of the hardest chores a detective has is hanging_around on a city street , trying to make himself inconspicuous , keeping_an_eye_on the entrance of an office_building and waiting.
     For the first fifteen or twenty minutes it 's possible to be more_or_less interested in window displays , then in people passing_by.
   After a while , however , a person 's mind gets fed_up and that magnifies all_of the disagreeable physical symptoms which go_with that sort_of an assignment.
   You want to sit_down.
   Your leg muscles and back muscles feel weary.
   You 're conscious_of the fact that your feet hurt , that the city pavements are hard.
     I waited a solid two hours before my man came_out of the office_building.
   He came_out alone.
     I was n't far behind him when he entered the parking_lot and hurried over to his car.
     The attendant recognized me once_more and said ,  What did you do about that office ?
      I have n't made_up my mind yet  , I said.
    It 's a sublease.
   I have a_couple_of them I 'm figuring on ; one here and one that 's out quite a ways where there 's usually curb parking .
      That curb parking is undependable and annoying , particularly when it rains  , he said.
     I kept trying to get him to take my money.
    Okay  , I told him.
    I 'm in a rush right_now.
   I know where the car is.
   Want me to drive it out ?
      I 'll have one of the boys get it  , he said.
    It 's one of the rules on transients.
   Regulars drive out their own cars .
      Make it as snappy as you can , will you ?
   I asked.
      Oh , that 's all_right  , he said.
    You 're going_to be a regular.
   You 'll get_in the office_building here.
   You do n't want to lease a place way_out in the sticks.
   You get business where the business is , not where it is n't .
     I grinned at him , handed him a_couple_of dollars and said ,  By the time you get the parking charge figured up , there should be a cigar in it for you .
     I hurried over to the agency heap , jumped in , started the motor and was just_in_time to see the car I wanted to shadow turn to the left.
     I was held_up a_bit trying to make a left turn.
   By the time I 'd made it he was gone.
   Traffic was pretty heavy.
     I turned_on the electric bug , and the signal came_in loud and clear.
     I made time and picked him up within ten blocks.
   I stayed half a block behind him , letting lots_of cars keep in between us , listening to the steady beep beep beep.
     After fifteen minutes of traffic driving he turned to the left.
   I could n't see him , but the electric bugging device gave steady beeps when it was straight ahead , short half beeps when the car I was following was to the left , and long drawn-out beeps when it turned to the right.
   If it ever got behind me , the beep turned to a buzz.
     I turned left too_soon and got a signal showing that I was still behind him but he was to the right.
   After a while the signal became a buzz and I knew he was behind me.
   That meant he 'd parked someplace.
   I made a big circle until I located the car parked at the curb in_front of an apartment house.
     I found a parking place half a block away , sat in the car and waited.
     My quarry was in the apartment house for two hours.
   Then he came_out and started driving toward the beach.
     By this time it was dark.
   I could get up close_to him where there was traffic but had to drop far behind when there was n't traffic.
   My lights would have been a giveaway if I 'd tried to shadow him in the conventional manner.
   Moreover , I 'd have lost him if it had n't been for the electronic shadowing device.
   His signal was coming loud and clear and_then all_of_a_sudden it turned to a buzz.
   I circled the block and found he was in the parking_lot of a high-class restaurant.
     I sat where I could watch the exit and realized I was hungry.
   I sat there with the faint odor of charcoal-broiled steaks tantalizing my nostrils and occasionally catching the aroma of coffee.
     My man came_out an hour later , drove to the beach , turned right and after half a mile went to the Swim and Tan_Motel.
     It was a fairly modern motel with quite a_bit of electrical display in_front.
   I remembered it was the Peeping_Tom place.
     I waited until my man was coming_out of the office with the key to a cabin before I went_in to register.
     The card the man I was shadowing had filled_out was still on the counter.
   I noticed that he was in Unit 12 and that he had registered under the name of Oscar_L._Palmer and wife , giving a San_Francisco address.
     He had written out the license_number of his car but had transposed the last two figures , an old dodge which is still good.
   Ninety-nine times_out of a_hundred the motel manager does n't check the license_number on the plates against the license_number the tenant writes out.
   If he does , it 's still better than an even_chance he won n't notice the transposition of the numbers , and if he should notice it , the thing can be passed_off as an honest mistake.
     I used the alias of Robert_C._Richards , gave the first three letters and the first_and_last figure of the license_number on the agency heap , but a_couple_of phony numbers in_between.
     I could have written anything.
   The manager of the motel was a woman who apparently did n't care.
   She was complying with the law in regard_to registrations but she certainly was n't checking license_numbers or bothering the tenants.
      You mean you 're all alone , Mr._Richards ?
      That 's right .
      Your wife is n't going_to join you - later ?
      I do n't think so .
      If you expect her to show_up  , she said ,  you 'd better put ' and wife ' on there.
   It 's a formality , you know .
      Any difference in the rate ?
   I asked.
      Not to you  , she said smiling.
    It 's ten dollars either way.
   There are ice_cubes in a container at the far end and in another by the office.
   There are three soft-drink vending_machines , and if you should be joined by - anybody - try to keep things quiet , if you will.
   We like to run a nice quiet place .
      Thank_you  , I told her.
     I took another sidelong glance at the other registration card , then took the key to Unit 13 that she had given me and went_down long enough to park the car.
     The construction was reasonably solid ; not like the cracker-box construction of so many_of the motel units that have stucco all_over the outside but walls that are thin enough so you can hear every movement of the people in the adjoining apartment.
     I put a small electric amplifier against the wall on_the_side I wanted to case.
   With the aid of_that I could hear my man moving around , heard him cough a_couple_of times , heard the toilet flush , heard the sound of water running.
     Whoever his companion was going_to be , she was going_to join him later.
   She knew where to come.
   He did n't have_to telephone.
     I was so hungry my stomach felt all lines of communication had been severed.
   It 's one thing to go without food when you 're occupied with some work or when you 're simply postponing a meal , but when you 're dependent_on someone else and know that you can n't eat until he 's bedded_down for the night , hunger can be a gnawing torture.
     I had noticed a drive-in down the road a quarter of a mile.
   The batteries on the bugging device I had put on the car were still fresh enough to send_out good strong signals.
   The powerful microphone I could press against the wall between my motel unit and that occupied by the man would bring_in the sound of any conversation , and I was positively nauseated I was so hungry.
     I got_in the car , drove down to the drive-in and ordered a_couple_of hamburgers with everything_included , a cup of coffee and the fastest service possible.
     The place was n't particularly busy at_that_time of night , and the girl who was waiting on me , who was clothed in the tightest-fitting pair of slacks I had ever seen on a woman and a sweater that showed everything there was - and there was lots_of it - wanted to be sociable.
      You really in a hurry , Handsome ?
 she asked.
      I 'm in a hurry , Beautiful .
      It 's early in the evening to be in a hurry.
   There 's lots_of time left .
    There may not be any women left  , I said.
     She gave a_little pout and said ,  I do n't get_off work until eleven o ' clock.
   That 's when my evening commences .
      I 'll be here at ten-fifty-five  , I said.
      Oh , you!
  she announced.
    That 's what they all say.
   What 's that thing going buzz-buzz-buzz in your car ?
     I said  Darn it , that 's the automatic signal that shows when the ignition_key is on.
   I did n't turn it off .
   I reached over and switched_off the electronic bugging device.
     She went_in to get the hamburgers , and I switched_on the device again and kept the signal from Dowling 's car coming_in steady and clear until I saw her starting back with the hamburgers.
   Then I shut_off the device again.
     She wanted to hang_around while I was eating.
    Do n't you think it 's selfish to have dinner before you go to pick her up ?
      No  , I said.
    It 's a kindness to her.
   You see , she 's on a diet.
   She 'll eat just a pineapple and cottage_cheese salad and I 'm to have one with her so she won n't feel out of place .
      diets can be terrible  , the girl said.
    How much overweight is she ?
      Not a_bit  , I said ,  but she 's keeping her figure in_hand .
     She looked at me provocatively.
    Good figures should be kept in_hand  , she said , and walked away with an exaggerated wiggle.
     I turned_on the device again , half fearful that I might find silence , but the buzzes came_in loud and clear.
     When I switched_on the lights for her to come and get the check , I had the exact change plus a dollar tip.
    
    The fat man said ,  All we gotta do is go around the corner .
     The gun moved.
   The thin man said ,  That-a-way .
      - second building on the right .
      - it says police right_on the door .
      - so even if we was as dumb as you take us for , we could still find it .
     Roberta and Dave began to back toward the door.
   The thin man waved the gun again.
   He said ,  Right around the corner .
      It says water works , but there is a policeman on_duty , too .
      A night policeman just like in the States.
   You know ?
      Canada does n't have much of_this here juvenile_delinquency problem , but we keep a night policeman all_the_same on account of the crazy tourists .
     At the door , Dave paused to feel for the latch.
   Roberta glanced up at her husband.
   He was going_to be sensible and not try to do anything rash with_that gun pointed at him.
   She measured the distance from_where they stood to the men and the gun , measured the distance from the men to_the_back room.
   She decided to risk it.
   There was something phony about all this gun waving - something not_quite what it seemed in the detailed directions for finding the police.
     Dave had the latch under his thumb now and he removed his arm from his wife in_order_to pull the door open.
   In_a_flash she was away to_the_back , paying no attention to three angry shouts from the male throats.
   She tore open the back door.
   It was dark inside the room but enough light spilled from the restaurant behind her to enable her to make_out a round_table with a green cloth top.
   There was a small sideboard with some empty beer_bottles on_it and perhaps fifteen wooden chairs.
     Slowly she turned to face the men again.
   Rat-face at the counter was on his feet.
   The distance between where she stood and where Dave waited at the outside_door was a_hundred miles.
   Keeping her frightened gaze on the men at the counter , she began to feel her way to the door.
   She sidled along the booths one step at_a_time.
   The gun followed her.
     As she reached Dave and felt his arm go around her , felt him pull her to the safety of his person , she knew with the certainty of despair that something bad had happened to Lauren.
     The two men watched as Dave closed the door behind them , watched them cross the sidewalk to their car.
   It was getting light.
   The fat man removed his apron , put_on a greasy and wrinkled jacket , and zipped it over his paunch.
     The thin man moved swiftly to the phone and dialed a number.
   When he was answered , he said ,  Albert?
   Vince.
   I 'm sending you a_couple_of customers - yeah - just get them out of my hair and keep them out - I do n't give_a_damn what you tell them - only do n't believe a word they say - they 're out to make trouble for me and it is up_to you to stop them - I do n't care how - and one more thing - Cate 's Cafe closed at eleven like always last night and Rose and Clarence_Corsi left for Quebec yesterday - some shrine or other - I think it was called Saint_Simon 's - yeah , yesterday.
   Got_it ?
     He turned from the phone and strode to the front of the restaurant.
   The white Buick had n't moved away yet.
   Good.
   A line of worry formed , a twitch pulled his mouth over to one side.
     He said ,  Grosse?
   You ai n't kidding me - the kid do n't know the name of_this town ?
      I ai n't kidding you , Vince.
   How could she?
   She musta been walking in her sleep - you seen her yourself in here .
      Howda I know ?
      Remember how she looked when Barney held the door for her?
   Kinda like a zombie?
   She was just waking_up when we found her at the garage .
     Vince swore.
    Stupid fools - ai n't got enough brains between the two of you  -     Grosse muttered , his head down , one hand playing with the zipper on his jacket.
    - had enough brains to call ya up so as ya could do sompin about it when the parents - I coulda let her go go  - His eyes were lowered , so he could n't have seen the narrow , pointed face of his companion suddenly writhe with fury ; but he was aware_of it just the same.
   He knew Vince_Steiner was one of those men who had_to work_up a fury once_in_a_while just to prove how dangerous he could be.
     With a curse , Vince seized the thing nearest , a glass sugar container with a spouted metal top , and threw it against the wall opposite.
   The heavy glass did n't break , but the top flew off ; sugar sprayed with a hiss that was loud in the silence.
     Not really startled , but careful to appear so , Grosse sucked noisily on his pipe.
   Vince cursed steadily.
    Why does everything have_to happen to me ?
     Grosse quietly got a broom and started to sweep up the sugar.
   Vince watched him.
   His mouth worked over the profanity , the obscenities in his vocabulary.
   Once he said ,  Why ' n hell did n't you look in_the_back seat of the car before you drove off?
   Do n't you and Barney ever use your brains ?
     The fat man did n't answer.
   He got one of the menus and brushed the spilled sugar onto it and carried it to a box on the floor behind the counter.
   He returned the menu to its place between catchup bottle and paper napkin dispenser.
     He spoke soothingly.
    She do n't know nothing about them cars.
   She thinks she 's in a ordinary garage .
      How do you know , stupid?
   And put Cate 's gun back .
      I know .
   Grosse tucked the gun under_the_counter.
      - one word of_this gets to Guardino  -      Who 's telling Guardino ?
     Vince swore again.
    You get that kid over to Rose 's house .
     The fat man winced.
   He ran a finger down his cheek , tracing the scratch there.
    Why can n't I leave her locked_up in the tool crib ?
     The thin man stopped his pacing long enough to glance at the clock.
    You and Barney get her over to Rose 's before it gets too light.
   After Guardino 's left , we 'll dump the kid somewhere near the border where she kin get home.
   God help you if she knows where she 's been .
     Grosse spread his hands.
    What am I going_to do with her all day?
   In the tool crib she can n't get_away .
      What the hell do I care what you do with her all day?
   Just get her where Guardino won n't see her and start asking questions .
     Grosse swore now.
    Dammit all , Vince.
   I ai n't no baby sitter .
     Vince shouted finally ,  Get her over to Rose 's and I 'll come_by and see that she stays_put .
     Grosse rubbed the bridge of his nose where it was swollen.
   He spoke sullenly.
    You do n't hafta get nasty.
   I wish you luck when you try scaring that kid .
   Suddenly he grinned.
   His voice lost its sullen tones and he chuckled.
    I got one question .
      What is it ?
   Impatiently.
      Are you a poor dumb Canadian or a smart_aleck from the States ?
     Vince lifted his hand as if to strike , but his thin lips spread in a smile.
   Grosse ducked and sniggered.
    Where 'd you say you was_born ?
      In a Chicago slum just like you.
   And I ai n't going_back there on account of one lousy kid .
     Lauren_Landis rubbed her face against the blanket.
   She had cried a_little because she was frightened.
   She could easily understand why the two men had been startled to find a strange girl in_the_back seat of their car ( she had figured that out ) , but she could n't understand their subsequent actions.
   Was it because she had shown panic?
   Who could blame her for that?
   It was one thing to awaken outside a restaurant where your parents were eating and quite another to awaken in a strange garage and know your parents had gone_on home without you.
     She was glad the fat man had left.
   Barney was not really frightening.
   She jumped as the little man now appeared at the window and , reaching through the opening , offered her a bottle of coke.
   She smiled at him wetly.
   Although she found she was thirsty , she was about to refuse ( never , never take candy from a strange man ) when she saw the bottle was unopened.
   He placed a bottle_opener on the counter.
   So , he understood her panic.
   She blew her nose on a tissue and opened the coke bottle.
   It was icy cold and tasted delicious.
   She felt a lift in spirit.
   When she was finished she pushed it back.
   The man was busy doing something to the inside of the door-frame on the driver 's side of a car.
     She called softly ,  Barney .
     He looked in her direction but he did n't answer.
     She said ,  Barney , why is he keeping me here ?
     Still no answer.
   He seemed to be looking at a point above the little window.
     Lauren said ,  Why can n't I call my home?
   Or borrow some money from someone and go_home by bus?
   I could send the money right back .
     Barney finished the cigarette he had been smoking.
   He dropped it and carefully ground it to nothing with the sole of his heavy shoe.
   Now he looked at her.
   He said ,  I only work here .
     Lauren said ,  Please ?
   But he was back at_work on a car.
     She dropped her head on her arms on the counter.
   How could he be kind one moment and cruel the next?
   Did he know something that made him feel sad and sorry_for her?
   And was he afraid to do anything as definite as releasing her?
   Her heart was thumping painfully ; the unknown was so_much worse than - what dangers lay ahead for her?
   What awful thing had she to face in the next few hours?
   Something wet and hot was trickling on her wrists.
   Tears?
     With a sturdy act of will she turned her mind away from herself ; as long as she could do nothing constructive about the situation she was in , she would think_about something else.
   Her mother and father , for_instance.
   Where were they now?
   In her mind she followed the white Buick along the road somewhere between here and the Niagara_River.
   Her father 's attention would be on the road ahead and it would n't deviate an inch until he crossed the bridge at the Falls and took the River_Road to LaSalle and , finally , turned_in at their own driveway at 387 Heather_Heights.
   Then he would yawn and stretch and shout ,  All out.
   This is the end of the line .
     And what would her mother be doing right_now?
   Her mother would be fast asleep curled_up against that wonderful , big , safe , solid shoulder next to her on the front seat.
     Lauren_Landis was in_trouble and she was alone.
     Roberta_Landis put her hand on her husband 's arm as he slid in the driver 's seat beside her.
   Somewhere birds were sweetly calling , were answered.
   Her teeth chattered so_that she made three attempts at speech before she became intelligible.
      Dave.
   I saw that woman 's apron behind the door.
   There was a wet spot - she could n't have been gone long .
     Dave made some sound meant to convey agreement.
   He inserted the car key in the lock.
   Roberta was violently trembling.
     She stammered ,  You heard what he said about police?
   Why do n't we drive around the corner ?
     The car_door crashed shut.
   The engine throbbed into life.
   Dave said ,  I got the message.
   We 're going .
     Roberta said ,  No.
   You go.
   Walk.
   Suppose Lauren comes looking_for us?
   I can sit here in the car while you walk around the corner .
     The big car sprang away from the curb like something alive.
   He said ,  I 'm not going_to leave my wife and my car out here in_sight of those  -     Roberta glanced at him and stopped trembling.
    
    His jowls were spiked by barbs of graying beard.
   His small , mean eyes regarded Marty steadily , unblinkingly.
   His eyes were threaded by little filaments of red as if tiny veins had burst and flooded blood into them.
   As he chewed his gum and exuded wheezing breath , Marty smelt the reek of bad whiskey.
     Marty recognized the man.
   He had driven the car that passed them on_the_road outside Admassy 's place.
   This was Acey_Squire , proprietor of the juke joint.
     Marty smiled at Squire pleasantly and said ,  There was a cab waiting for me here.
   Do you know where it might have gone ?
     Squire chewed his gum , his jaw moving in a steady rhythm.
   He looked straight at Marty.
   He did not answer.
   Marty scanned the faces of the others nearest him , looked into their staring eyes.
      Did anyone see my cab ?
 he asked , keeping his voice casual.
     He avoided showing any surprise or annoyance when no one answered him.
      I have to get_back to Jarrodsville  , he went_on.
    I see there are some cars here.
   I wonder if one of you gentlemen could drive me back to town?
   I 'd be happy to pay for the favor , of_course .
     The seventeen men stood and stared at him for a moment longer.
   And_then a startling thing occurred.
   It was so utterly unexpected that Marty stood for several moments with his mouth hanging open foolishly after it had happened.
     There was no word spoken , no apparent signal given.
     Yet the men all moved at the same instant.
     They piled into the waiting cars , motors roared , the cars sped off.
     The station_wagon and the old Plymouth headed east toward Jarrodsville.
   The Ford and the pickup_truck sped west toward Sanford 's Run.
     In seconds all four cars were out_of_sight.
     Marty_Land stood alone on a red-clay road as storm_clouds gathered ominously in_the_sky again.
   From a_great_distance thunder growled and broke the silence.
     Land looked_back toward the dilapidated house.
   He thought he saw a pale face at a window.
   Perhaps it was Dora_May.
   Perhaps she would be glad that they had n't hurt him.
     There were other farmhouses nearby.
   Across the road there was one no_more_than a_hundred yards away.
   There was another on this side , a_little further_down.
   There were many_more between here and Jarrodsville.
   Telephone_poles lined the road.
   They reared tall and mocking.
   Their wires stretched out into infinity.
   Not a single strand of wire reached_into the silent houses beside the red-clay road.
     There was nothing he could do but walk.
   And Jarrodsville was more_than three miles away , down an old dirt road that the rain had turned_into a quagmire.
     Marty faced east and started walking down the left side of the road.
   After he had proceeded a_few feet , he paused and turned_up the cuffs of his trousers , which were already damp and mud-caked.
   The viscous mud was ankle-deep , and in places great puddles spread across the road and reflected the murky light.
     As he approached the first farmhouse , thunder sounded behind him again , closer now and louder , like a steadily advancing drum corps.
   There were several people on the porch of the farmhouse.
   There was a very old_man and a young_woman and a brood of children ranging from toddlers to teen-agers.
   For just an instant he thought_of appealing_to them for help.
   Perhaps they had a car or truck and would drive him into town.
   Then he realized the utter futility of the idea.
   They were staring at him in the same blank and menacing way that the men outside the gate had stared.
   Even the eyes of the smallest children seemed malicious.
     On his side of the road there were two farm hands , well back in a field , leaning_against a plow.
   They , too , stared at him.
     The drums of thunder were right behind him now.
     A foolish thought came into his head.
   He remembered a story he had read as a youth.
   It was probably one of Kipling 's tales of the_British Army.
   It concerned an officer who had been disgraced and drummed_out.
   The steady roll of the drums had sounded behind him as he walked between the endless ranks of the men he had commanded , and each man about-faced and turned his back as the officer approached.
   Marty wished these poor farm people would turn their backs.
     The fencing by the roadside ended.
   Now the dirt highway was bordered on either side by a fairly deep drainage_ditch , too broad to leap over unless you were an Olympic star.
   The day 's rain had been added to the stagnant water.
   He was trapped on_the_road when he heard the sound of an approaching car.
   It was coming toward him.
   The car was now in_sight.
   Marty 's heart skipped a beat when he recognized it.
   It was the station_wagon that had passed his cab on_the_road , the station_wagon that had been parked at the Burch farm.
   Acey_Squire 's station_wagon.
   It had headed back toward Jarrodsville.
   That had only been a ruse to lure him out on the deserted road.
   Now Acey and his friends were returning to seek him out.
     The station_wagon came to a stop a_couple_of hundred feet in_front of him , beside a fenced field.
   Then there was another sound.
   A second car was coming from the west , from the direction of Sanford 's Run.
   It was the Ford that had been outside Burch 's farm.
     Marty looked helplessly in both directions.
   It was a narrow road , barely wide enough for two cars to pass.
   He could not leave the road because of the water-filled drainage_ditch.
   When the two cars were equidistant from him , the station_wagon started_up again and the Ford gathered speed.
   They bore_down_on him.
   There was nothing he could do except jump into the ditch.
     He jumped , and sank to his knees in muddy water.
     As the two cars roared by , there was a high-pitched eerie , nerve-shattering sound.
   Marty knew how the Union soldiers must have felt at Chancellorsville and Antietam and Gettysburg when the ragged gray ranks charged at them , screaming the wild banshee howl they called the Rebel yell.
     For moments he stood in water , shivering and gasping for breath.
   He had turned his ankle slightly , and it pained him.
   The cars , with their load of howling men , had disappeared in the distance.
   There had been two more cars parked at the farm , a Plymouth and a pickup_truck.
   They would be coming for him next , bearing_down_on him from both directions.
   And_then the station_wagon and the Ford would seek him out again.
   He would be harassed repeatedly and would escape death by_inches time after time , all_the_way to Jarrodsville.
   He still had three miles to go.
   Back East the more affluent juvenile_delinquents , who could afford hyped-up autos instead of switch blades as lethal weapons , played this same game and called it  Chicken .
     He could not go through the fields.
   That way was barred on both sides of the road by a high barbed-wire fence.
   He had to make for the section of road just ahead that was bordered by the rail_fence , the section by the farmhouse.
   At_least he could climb_up on_the_fence when his tormenters roared by again.
   The Admassy place could not be far now.
   He would go_in there , climb through the window , and at_least be safe for a_little while and able to rest.
   There was even a bare chance that the phone had not been disconnected.
     He did not dare climb back up to the road.
   He was deep in water , but at_least they could not reach him there.
   He splashed on , mud sucking at his feet with each step , until he reached the end of the drainage_ditch and the beginning of the fence that enclosed the farm.
   He climbed back to the road , and he felt utterly exhausted.
   He stood , panting , for a moment.
   And_then he saw something that he had not seen before , and panic gripped him again.
     The fence , his only refuge when the metal death came roaring at him , was made of rails , all_right , but the rails were protected by a thick screening of barbed_wire that would rip his flesh if he pressed against it.
   He lurched on down the road despairingly , because there was no place else to go.
     He lost all sense of dignity.
   You could not stand on dignity when you were soaked and muddied and your life was at stake.
   Probably people were watching him from the porch or from behind the windows of_this farmhouse , too , but he did not bother to look.
   He broke_into a dogtrot , breathing heavily , streaming with sweat.
   He had to reach Admassy 's place.
   It was his only sanctuary.
   The fences on both sides of the road bristled with the barbed_wire.
   The fences stretched on endlessly.
     And_then he heard them.
     And now he saw them.
     The Plymouth was coming at him from the east , the pickup_truck from the west.
   They had timed it better this time.
   They would reach him at almost exactly the same instant.
   He stopped stone-still.
   If he backed against the fence , one of the cars would brush him as it passed , and he would be cruelly lacerated by the wire.
     He stumbled to the middle of the road and simply stood there , waiting for them , a perfect target.
     The cars must have had their gas pedals pushed_down to the floor_boards.
   They were coming_on at reckless speed for such old vehicles.
   They thundered at him.
   He held his arms close_to his sides and made himself as small as possible.
   When the Plymouth neared , it veered toward him and seemed about to run him down.
   He forced himself to stay frozen there.
   If he moved , he would be in the path of the other car.
   He thought the fender of the Plymouth brushed his jacket as it went_by.
   In a fraction of a second the pickup_truck hurtled by on the other side.
     The weird , insane sound of the Rebel yell reverberated again and echoed from the distant hills.
     He did not leave the middle of the road.
   He did not try to run.
   He trudged on , his aching eyes focused straight ahead.
   He was nearing the Admassy house.
   He was going_to make_it , he told himself.
   And_then he heard a car coming from the east , and he felt as if he would break_down and weep.
      Oh , no , not again  , he said aloud.
    Not again so soon .
     There was a new sound , a sound as piercing as the Rebel yell , yet different.
   It was the sound of a siren.
   Now he saw that the approaching car was painted white , and he began to wave his arms frantically.
   It was the prowl_car from the sheriff 's office.
     The car drew_up alongside him and stopped.
      Get_in  , Charley_Estes said brusquely.
     He staggered into the back seat and lay back , fighting for breath.
   There was someone in_front with the sheriff.
   It was Pete_Holmes , the cabdriver.
     Pete turned_around and said to Marty ,  I guess you think I 'm a yellow-bellied hound.
   But there was n't no use in me staying there.
   I could n't fight a dozen or_so of ' em.
   If I 'd stayed , all that I 'd have_got was four punctured tires and one busted head.
   Why did n't you wait at the Burch house?
   You must 've known I 'd gone to get the sheriff.
   I was lucky they let me go , I guess .
     The sheriff was occupied with maneuvering the car around in a very narrow space.
   When it was finally pointed east , he said ,  You should never have come out here alone.
   This is redneck country.
   Every man in every one of these houses is a Night_Rider.
    
    Then he turned the telephone over to Rourke , and went_into the bedroom to change his slippers for dry socks and shoes.
   Rourke was talking on the phone when he came_back.
    About an hour , eh?
   Are you positive ?
   He listened a moment and_then said ,  Hold_it .
   He turned his head and said ,  Alvarez will definitely be in a back_room at the Jai_Alai Club on South_Beach within an hour.
   Want to try and meet him there ?
     Shayne looked at his watch.
   That was n't too far from Fifth_Street , and should allow him to make Scotty 's Bar by midnight.
   He said with satisfaction ,  That 's fine , Tim.
   I 'll be there .
     Rourke confirmed the appointment over the phone and hung_up.
    I do n't know what you 're getting_into , Mike  , he said unhappily.
    I hope to Christ .
     Shayne said briskly ,  Grab another drink if you want it.
   We 've got one other call to make before I meet Alvarez .
      Where ?
      It 's out in the Northeast section.
   Have you got my car here ?
      It 's parked in_front .
   Rourke hastily slopped whiskey into his glass on top of half-melted ice-cubes.
      I 'd better keep_on driving yours  , Shayne decided ,  because I 'll be going_on over to the Beach.
   I can drop you back here to pick mine up .
   He went_to a closet to get a light jacket , and took his hat from beside the door.
   Timothy_Rourke gulped down the whiskey hastily and joined him , asking ,  Who are we going_to call on in the Northeast section ?
      A lady.
   That_is , maybe not too_much of a lady.
   At_least , I want to find_out whether she 's home yet or not .
   He opened the door and followed Rourke out.
     In Rourke 's car , Shayne drove east to Biscayne_Boulevard and north toward Felice_Perrin 's address which had been given to him by the Peralta governess.
   As he drove , he filled_in Timothy_Rourke briefly on the events of the evening after leaving the reporter to go_to the Peralta house , and on_his_own surmises.
      I want to be in Scotty 's Bar at midnight when Marsha makes her phone_call there  , he ended grimly.
    I do n't know whether that threatening letter of hers has anything to do with this situation or not , but I want to see who takes the call .
      This deal at Las_Putas_Buenas where the two knife-men jumped you  , said Rourke with interest ,  that sounds like it was set_up with malice aforethought by the luscious Mrs._Peralta , does n't it ?
      It does  , Shayne grunted sourly , still able to taste her mouth on his in the Green_Jungle parking_lot.
    That story of hers about an unsigned note directing her to be there tonight sounds completely phony.
   If it was designed to put me on_the_spot , it would have_to have been written before Peralta ever called me in on the case .
      Do you think Laura did have the counterfeit bracelet made without her husband 's knowledge ?
      I have n't the faintest idea.
   I think her husband strongly suspects so , and that 's why he called me in on the thing in direct defiance of his confederates and almost certainly without telling them why he was doing so.
   Is n't this Felice 's street ?
   Shayne asked , peering ahead at the partially obscured street_sign.
     Rourke could see it better out the right-hand side , and he said ,  Yes.
   Turn to the left , I think , for that number you gave me.
   Not more_than a block or_so .
     Shayne got_in the left-hand lane and cut_across the Boulevard divider.
   There was a small , neon-lighted restaurant and cocktail_lounge on the southeast corner of the intersection as he turned into the quiet , palm-lined street where most_of the houses on both sides were older two-story mansions , now cut_up into furnished rooms and housekeeping apartments.
     Shayne drove westward from the Boulevard slowly , letting Rourke crane his head out the window and watch for street numbers.
   A single automobile was parked half-way up the block on the left-hand side.
   Shayne noted idly that it carried Miami_Beach license_plates as he approached , and_then saw the flare of a match in the front seat as they passed , indicating that it was occupied.
     He turned to see the briefly-illumed faces of two men in the parked car just_as Rourke said ,  It 's the next house , Mike.
   On_the_right .
     Instead of pulling into the curb , Shayne increased his speed slightly to the corner where he swung left.
   He went around the corner and parked , turning_off his lights and motor.
      I told you , Mike  , said Rourke in an aggrieved voice.
    It was back there .
     Shayne said ,  I know it was , Tim .
   His voice was chilling and cold.
    Did you see the car parked across the street ?
      I did n't notice it.
   I was watching for numbers .
      It has a Beach license , Tim.
   Two men in the front seat.
   I got a quick look at their faces as we went_past.
   Unless I 'm crazy as hell , they 're two of Painter 's dicks.
   A couple named Harris and Geely.
   Those names mean anything to you ?
      Wait a minute , Mike.
   In Painter 's office this_evening .
     Shayne nodded grimly.
    The pair whom Petey is officially commending for slapping me around and pulling me in .
      What are they doing here ?
      A stake-out , I suppose.
   On Felice_Perrin.
   Maybe with specific orders to see that I do n't make contact with her.
   I 'm not positive , Tim.
   I may be wrong.
   I 'll slide out and walk_around the block back to the cocktail_lounge on Biscayne.
   You drive on and circle back and pull_up beside them parked there.
   You 're a reporter , and you 're looking_for Miss_Perrin to interview her.
   Make them show their hands.
   If they are Beach cops on a stake-out , they 'll admit it to a reporter.
   They 've got no official standing on this side of the Bay.
   As soon as you find_out if they are Geely and Harris , come on around to the lounge where I 'll be waiting .
     Shayne opened the door on his side and stepped_out.
   Timothy_Rourke groaned dismally as he slid under the wheel.
    The things you talk me into , Mike .
     Shayne chuckled.
    How often do they add_up to headlines?
   You should complain .
     He crossed the street and walked swiftly southward to circle back to the Boulevard and north a block to the open restaurant.
     He was standing at the end of the bar enjoying a slug of cognac when Rourke came_in six or eight minutes later.
   The reporter nodded as he moved up beside him at the bar.
   Shayne told the bartender ,  Bourbon and water  , and Rourke told him ,  It 's those two , all_right.
   Harris and Geely.
   I made them show me their identification before I could be persuaded not to call on Felice_Perrin .
     Shayne said happily ,  I 've got it all worked_out , Tim.
   Take your time with your drink.
   I 'll beat_it.
   In exactly three minutes , go_in that phone_booth behind you and call Police_Headquarters.
   Be excited and do n't identify yourself.
   Just say that a_couple_of drunks are having a hell of a fight down the street , and they better send a patrol_car.
   Then hang_up fast and come walking on down to the Perrin address.
   I 'll be waiting for you there .
     The bartender brought Rourke 's drink and Shayne laid a twenty-dollar bill on the bar.
   He said in_a_low_voice ,  I 've got a date with a lady , Mister.
   Will that pay for a pint I can take with me.
   You know how it is  , he added with a conspiratorial wink.
    Candy is dandy , but liquor is quicker and you do n't have any candy for_sale here anyhow .
      We sure do n't .
   The bartender winked back at him and palmed the bill.
   He turned_away and returned in_a_moment with a pint of brandy in a small paper sack which he slid over the counter to Shayne.
     As the detective slid it into his pocket , Rourke asked sadly ,  What in hell are you going_to do , Mike ?
      Make a_couple_of punk detectives named Geely and Harris wish to God they 'd stayed out of my way this afternoon.
   Three minutes , Tim .
     Shayne strode out blithely , and Rourke checked his watch and sipped his drink , getting a dime ready_to make the telephone_call to the police.
     Outside , Shayne hesitated when he saw that Rourke had parked his coupe directly in_front of the bar headed south.
   He walked over to the right-hand door , opened it and got the reloaded automatic out of the glove_compartment and put it in his hip_pocket.
   He hoped he would n't be forced to use it in taking_care of the Beach detectives , but its weight was comforting at his hip.
   On this side of the Bay , Miami_Beach cops had no_more legal_rights than any ordinary citizen , and Shayne 's pistol permit was just_as good as theirs.
     He went swiftly up the sidewalk toward the parked car with the two Beach detectives in the front seat.
   He tugged the brim of his hat low as he approached , stepped out into the street just behind the car and strode around to the right-hand side.
     The big , paunchy man named Geely was on that side , half-turned in the seat toward his hatchet-faced companion so_that his back partially rested against the closed door.
     Shayne turned the handle and jerked the door open before either of the men were quite aware_of his presence in the night.
     Geely grunted and slid partly out , and Shayne 's left arm snaked in around his neck to help him , while he set himself solidly on the roadway and swung his right fist to the big , gum-chewing jaw before Geely could straighten_up.
     Shayne stepped back to let him slump to the ground , and_then dived over him through the open_door into Harris who was cursing loudly and trying to drag a gun from a shoulder_holster , somewhat impeded by the steering_wheel.
     Shayne locked his big_hands around Harris ' thin neck and dragged him out over the seat into the roadway.
   He hit him once on the sharp point of his chin and felt the body go limp.
   He dropped him into the street a_couple_of feet away from Geely 's recumbent figure and stared down at both of them for a moment before kicking the big man lightly in the side.
   He did n't stir.
   They were both breathing heavily , out_cold , and Shayne did n't think either of them had recognized him or could describe him.
     He got the pint of liquor out of his pocket and unscrewed the top , sprinkled the pungent stuff liberally over both men , and_then tossed the open bottle in on the front seat.
     He turned , then , to look toward the lighted Boulevard , and saw Rourke 's tall , emaciated figure come_out of the lounge and hurriedly start to angle across the street toward the opposite side.
     Shayne strolled across to intercept the reporter in_front of the two-story house where Felice_Perrin lived , and asked casually ,  Get the police okay ?
      Sure.
   Said they 'd have a patrol_car here fast.
   Let 's get inside.
   What happened with you ?
      Why the two damned fools got all excited when they saw the bottle , and knocked each other out_cold  , Shayne said good-humoredly.
    They 'll have fun explaining that to the Miami cops.
   Got no business over_here on a stake-out anyway .
     They went_up onto a front_porch and into a small hallway where a dim bulb burned high in the ceiling.
   A row of mailboxes along the wall had numbers and names on them.
   Shayne found one marked PERRIN 2 - A.
     The stairway on_the_right was dark , but there was a wall-switch at the bottom which lighted another dim bulb at the top , and they went_up.
     There were two front_rooms , both dark behind their transoms , and there was no sound or light in the entire house to indicate that any of the occupants were awake.
    
    Eight , nine steps above him , Roberts had paused.
   Mickey paused with him , waiting , no_longer impatient , trying now to think it out , do a_little planning.
   He looked down over the banister at the hotel desk , with the telephone and pen set.
     If I could call_in , they could check the story while we were on our way.
   I would n't have_to tell them I had Roberts -     Then he heard it , like a muffled thud , felt a subtle change in air_pressure.
   He glanced up in_time to see Roberts hurtling down on him from above , literally flying through the air , his bloody face twisted.
   Mickey tried to flatten against the banister , gripped it with one hand , but Roberts ' full weight struck him at that moment in the groin.
   He gasped for air and the impact tore his hand from the rail.
   He tumbled with Roberts , helpless and in agony , over_and_over , down the steps.
     By a wrenching effort , he managed to hunch and draw_in , to take the final fall on his back and shoulders rather_than his head.
   He was fuzzy in his mind and , for a moment , helpless on the lobby floor , but he was conscious , and free_of the weight of Roberts ' body.
   When his vision cleared he saw the taller one scrambling upward , reaching.
   Mickey was on his knees when Roberts turned on the stairs and the razor flashed in his hand.
   He felt his empty pocket and knew that Roberts had retrieved the only weapon at_hand.
     Mickey 's eyes fixed on the other 's feet , which would first betray the moment and direction of an attack.
   He rose stiffly , forcing his knees to lock.
   The knifelike pain in his groin nearly brought him down again.
   He made himself back_off slowly , his eyes wary on Roberts , who now had no_more to lose than he.
   The pain dulled as he moved , and he steadied inside.
   After a moment he extended one hand , the fingers curled.
      Come_on  , he said.
    You want to be that big a fool - I was hoping for this .
     Roberts brushed at his eyes with his free hand and started down the steps.
   He held the razor well out to one side.
   He was invulnerable to attack , but he could be handled , Mickey knew , if he could be brought to make the first move.
     They were eight feet apart when Roberts cleared the last step.
   Mickey waited with slack arms.
      Any time , Roberts  , he said.
    Or would it be easier if I put my hands in my pockets ?
     The taunt was lost on Roberts.
   He advanced slowly , directly , giving no hint of a feint to either side.
   He was just short of arm 's reach when he stopped.
   Mickey backed_off two steps , forcing him to come_on again.
   There was a fixed grin on Roberts ' face , made hideous by the swollen nose and the smeared blood.
     Mickey backed_off again and Roberts hesitated , then came along.
   They moved in a series of rhythmic fits and starts , a macabre dance - two steps back , two steps forward , two steps back.
   Mickey felt his shoulders come_up against the wall beside the heavy slab front_door.
   This was going_to be it now , any second , and what he had to remember was to keep his eye on the razor , no_matter what , even if Roberts should feint with a kick to the groin , the deadly hand was his exclusive concern.
     The kick came , sudden and vicious but short.
   Mickey 's guts twisted with the effort , but he kept his eye on the weapon.
   It moved in a silver arc toward his throat , then veered downward.
   He hunched his left shoulder into it and slashed at Roberts ' forearm with his own , felt the blade slide off his sleeve.
   Before Roberts could move inside to cut upward toward his face , he slammed his right fist into Roberts ' belly.
   Roberts sagged and slashed at him wildly.
   Ducking , Mickey tripped and fell to one side , landing heavily on the wood floor.
   Then Roberts was on him , gasping for breath and for a_couple_of seconds Mickey lost sight of the blade.
   He felt it rip at the side of his jacket and a momentary sting under his left ribs.
   He got a knee up into Roberts ' belly , used both hands and heaved him clear , then scrambled to his feet.
   They were in_the_center of the lobby now.
   Still clutching the razor , Roberts came_up into a crouch , shaking his head.
   When he charged Mickey was ready.
   He hit Roberts with his left fist in the ribs and the razor cut toward him feebly , then wobbled in mid-air.
   With his right fist , and nearly all his weight behind it , he smashed at the bloodstained face.
     Roberts careened backward , his back arched , fought for balance and , failing , stumbled against the newel_post at the foot of the stairs.
   The sound of his head striking the solid wood was an ultimate , sudden-end sound.
   He fell on his side across the lowest step , rolled_over once , then lay still.
     Mickey found himself leaning_against the desk , with stiff hands , panting for breath.
   After a minute he went to Roberts , looked at one of his eyes and felt for a pulse.
   He could n't feel any.
   Roberts appeared to be dead ; if_not yet , then soon , very soon.
   Suddenly it was cold in the lobby.
     It seemed to him that a long_time had passed before he decided what to do.
   Actually it was no_more_than eight or ten minutes , and the sum of his reasoning came to this :     There 's no way to take him in now and keep those other two - Wister and the one who hired the two of them - from finding_out about Roberts and lamming out.
   The local law here would hold me till they check clear back home , and maybe more_than that.
   They would have to.
   By then they could never catch_up_with the others.
   There 's no other way ; I 'll have to do it myself.
     He looked at where Roberts lay sprawled on the step.
   Mickey was sure now he was dead.
     One thing , he thought , nobody knows about it yet.
   Only me.
     He climbed the stairs , went_into Roberts ' room , found a suitcase and packed as much into it as he could.
   He left a_few things.
   It did n't have_to be perfect.
   Roberts was a wastrel.
   Walking away on impulse , he might logically leave_behind what it was inconvenient to carry.
     When he had closed the suitcase he found a rag and moved about the room , wiping carefully everything he might have touched.
   It took him nearly an hour.
   He went_to the room he had rented and got_into his overcoat.
   He left the rest of his things and returned to the lobby.
   He set Roberts ' suitcase near the front_door , went outside and walked back to the garage.
   He was mildly surprised to find it was snowing.
   It snowed softly , silently , an undulating interruption of his vision against the night sky.
   He could feel it on his face and in his hair.
     He found the key to the Jeep , got it started and warmed it up for five minutes.
   Then he backed_out and swung around to the front drive.
   He went_into the hotel and searched till he found the razor.
   He put it in his own pocket for safekeeping.
   He took the suitcase out to the Jeep and put it in the front seat.
   Then he went_back for Roberts.
     The body was heavier than he had anticipated.
   He got it onto his shoulder after some work and carried it outside and down to the Jeep.
   He dumped it into the back and made sure it would n't roll out , then returned to the porch and closed the front_door , making sure it was unlocked.
     He drove carefully in the direction of the brief tour they had taken earlier.
   It snowed continuously , but quietly , evenly.
   When he reached the dip in the woods , he saw that already the earlier ruts were barely discernible.
   The Jeep fought its way through the low spot and got onto higher ground.
   He drove in low_gear to the fork in the road and swung as_close_as possible to the entrance to the abandoned mine.
   He parked facing it and left the headlights on , but when he started into the tunnel with the suitcase , he found the illumination extended no farther than half_a_dozen feet into the passage.
   He went_back and got the flashlight , returned to the tunnel and carried the suitcase to the edge of the_pit he had found earlier.
   He tossed the bag into the_pit and watched dry dust spray up around it.
   When the dust settled , he went_back to the Jeep and carefully worked Roberts ' body onto his shoulder.
     It was n't like carrying the suitcase.
   The soft snow was deceitful underfoot.
   Twice he nearly fell.
   Inside the passage , he had to work his way over the fallen timber and nearly collapsed under his clumsy burden.
   By the time he reached the edge of the_pit he was panting and his shoulder and back ached under the drag of the dead weight.
     He stood looking down for a_few seconds , then backed_up two or three paces from the edge.
   There was too_much weight casually to toss it away.
   He could feel himself falling in with it and being unable to get_out.
   It would be a bad place to die.
   It was a bad place for Roberts to wind_up , but Roberts had asked_for it.
   It was too late to worry about that.
     He knelt slowly and dumped the corpse onto the floor of the tunnel.
   It was a relief to get_rid_of the weight.
   He was shaking with tension and it took him a_couple_of minutes to get his breath and settle down.
   Then he got on his knees and rolled Roberts ' body toward the edge.
   It hung momentarily on the point of dropping off.
   He gave it a strong push , heard it slide , then tumble dryly into the hole.
   He got to his feet and threw the flashlight beam into the_pit.
   The body lay in an awkward sprawl twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the tunnel floor.
     Deep enough , he decided.
   There was little chance anyone would enter this shaft during the winter.
   The external signs of his approach to_it would be covered by the snow , probably by the next day.
   It was n't cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact.
   By spring it would be a skeleton.
     He made his way back to the Jeep.
   He had started to back into the turn when he remembered the razor in his pocket.
   He climbed_down , went_back into the tunnel and tossed the razor into the_pit.
   It landed on Roberts ' sprawled right thigh , poised precariously , then slid off to the ground.
   He went_back once_more to the Jeep and started the short drive to the hotel.
     In the garage he checked the Jeep for signs of the use he had made of_it.
   There were stains here_and_there and he cleaned them off , using an oiled rag he found on a nail.
   He wiped the steering_wheel and all the places he might have touched the Jeep.
   He replaced the flashlight where it had been stowed , got into his own car and backed it out of the garage.
   There were tire marks where it had been , but they were overlapped by others and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable except under close scrutiny.
   Liz_Peabody , he thought , might spend some time grieving for her lost lover , but he doubted that she would launch an investigation.
   He judged her to be a woman of some pride , though not_much sense.
   Still she would probably have sense enough not to call_in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who , apparently , had run_away.
    
    He put_in a call to Cunningham from his hotel_room.
   The maid answered and he decided Nancy must be at_work.
     Jeb cautioned him not to be too hopeful and_then , ignoring his own advice , said excitedly ,  But it does sound good.
   A woman named Lisa who tells nobody anything about herself.
   That courtyard picture with the same initials .
      I 'm not exactly jumping up and down with_enthusiasm.
   I 'll call you in a day or_so .
     On the highway he relaxed and enjoyed the drive over Lake_Pontchartrain and along the coast.
     Gulf_Springs was ten miles inland - more of a quaint old coast town than those along the beach made garish by tourist attractions.
     He checked_into a motel and drove downtown.
   The courthouse was a white-stucco building minus the customary dome.
   Instead of the usual straggling privet hedges and patches of bare dirt in most small-town squares , the building was hemmed_in by a semitropical growth of camellias and azaleas and a smooth lawn the improbably bright-green shade of florist 's grass.
     He figured his best bet was a call on the sheriff.
   A clerk in the outer office took him in to Sheriff_Carruthers , a big , paunchy man with thick , white hair and a voice with a senatorial resonance which suggested he should be running for higher office.
     Seated in_front of the desk , Hank said ,  I 'm looking_for some information with very little to go_on , Sheriff .
     He explained the background of the case , ending with the tenuous clue which had brought him to Gulf_Springs.
     The sheriff 's swivel_chair tilted back.
    So you 're looking_for a woman who married a man who might have lived here a year ago and might have been poisoned.
   If there was such a person , I 'm afraid she got_away with_it.
   Pity we do n't know more about him.
   I think the best bet is to go_through the society columns of last year and see if any of the grooms match with the obituaries a_little later.
   It 'll be a tedious job , but if you want to try it , the old newspaper files are in the basement here in the county supervisor 's office .
      Maybe the society editor would remember a good-looking out-of-town bride .
      That 's an idea.
   Mrs._Calhoun has been society editor here for twenty-five years.
   The editor says that marriages may be made in heaven , but weddings are made in Mrs._Calhoun 's columns.
   She 's the one who decides which wedding is to get the lead space in the Sunday paper and all that .
   He smiled.
    Once , when the editor was just out of the hospital from a gallstone operation , Mrs._Calhoun and the mother of the bride went_out to his house and fought it out beside his bed.
   She 'd be sure to remember any bride who was vague about background.
   She 'd have made a great scientist dedicated_to tracking_down heredity and environment.
   She 'd also remember if the groom died later .
   He stood_up.
    I wish you good_luck , but please do n't dig_up too tough a case for me this close_to election.
   If you find_out anything , come on back here and we 'll get_started on_it .
     Tracking_down Mrs._Calhoun was like trying to catch_up_with Paul_Revere between Lexington and Concord.
   It turned_out that she also sold real_estate , cosmetics , and hospital insurance.
   The wearying trek stretched into the afternoon - from newspaper plant to insurance office to her house and back to the newspaper , where he found her at five o ' clock.
     She was a large woman with a frizzled gray poodle cut and a pencil clamped like a_bit between her teeth while she hunted and pecked on an old typewriter.
   It took a_couple_of minutes to run_through her various businesses and get down to the one he wanted.
      Last year?
   Well , I do remember one.
   From Baton_Rouge.
   Married a man named Vincent_Black.
   I remember her because she did n't want her picture in the paper.
   First bride like that I 've seen in twenty-five years .
      What reason did she give ?
      Said she had a breaking-out on her face - some sort_of allergy - and none of her old pictures was good enough.
   I did n't see her till several days later at the wedding , and her face looked like it had never had a blemish on_it.
   But , of_course , you could n't see too well through the veil .
      Was her name Lisa_Carmody ?
      Now how in hell would I remember that ?
      Never_mind.
   I can look it up.
   Do they still live here ?
      I think they moved away shortly after they were married.
   He was a salesman for something or other and must have been transferred.
   I 'm sure it 'll be in the files.
   We usually run a social note when somebody moves away .
     He stood_up and thanked her.
      Have they inherited some money or something ?
 she asked with a reportorial gleam in her eye.
     He said vaguely ,  Well , it is a_little legal matter , but nothing like that .
     He hurried across to the courthouse and caught the sheriff just_as he was leaving.
      Sounds like what you 're after  , he said when Hank had finished.
    Come_on , let 's hurry down before they lock_up for the day .
     In the basement the sheriff took him to a small , dingy office occupied by a tall , thin man informal in rolled-up shirt sleeves.
      Mr. Ferrell & & & Hirey_Lindsay , chairman_of_the_board of supervisors.
   Mr._Ferrell is a private_detective , Hirey.
   Wants to look_up something in the newspaper files , so do n't lock him in here .
      Sure  , said Hirey.
    I 'll just leave the door open.
   It latches when you close it , so stay as long as you like .
     Carruthers crossed the room to a metal door with an open grillework in the top half.
   He pulled it open.
    Now do n't shut this door.
   It won't open from inside.
   Before we built the new jail , we used_to keep prisoners in here overnight sometimes when the old jail got too crowded.
   Hirey treats himself a_lot better than we do prisoners.
   They were a sight more comfortable than the ones in the jail with the cold air from Hirey 's air conditioner coming_through the grille .
     He walked past the sheriff into a windowless room with shelves full_of big , leather-bound volumes from floor to ceiling all_around the walls.
   A metal table and four chairs stood in the center.
      They 're all here , back to 1865  , Carruthers told him.
    It 's all_right to smoke , but make sure your cigarettes are out before you leave.
   And , of_course , you know not to take clippings .
      I 'll leave the air conditioner on for you , Mr._Ferrell  , said Hirey.
    Do n't forget to turn it off and close the door good so it 'll latch .
     Hank thanked them and promised to observe the rules.
   When they had gone , he stood for a minute breathing_in the mustiness of old paper and leather which the busily thrumming air conditioner could n't quite dispel.
     In a tour around the stacks , he found that the earliest volumes began on_the_left and progressed clockwise around the room.
   An old weakness for burrowing in records rose_up to tempt him.
     It was , indeed , all here - almost a century.
   From reconstruction to moon rockets.
   But he pulled_away from the irrelevant old volumes and walked around to the newer ones.
     Last year 's volume was at the top a_couple_of inches below the ceiling.
   Near it was a metal ladder on casters attached to the top shelf.
   He pulled it over , climbed_up , and lifted_out the big volume , almost losing his balance from the weight of_it.
   He staggered over and dropped it on the table.
     Since Mrs._Calhoun remembered only that the marriage had been in the spring , he started to plod through several months.
   He tried to turn right to the society page in each one , but interesting stories kept cropping_up to distract him.
   At_last he found it in the paper of April 2.
     It told him little more_than Mrs._Calhoun had remembered , stating that it had been a small , modest wedding compared to some of the others.
     There was a marked contrast in the amount of information on bride and groom.
   Mr._Black 's life was an open book , so_to_speak , from his birth in Jackson , Mississippi , through his basketball-playing days at L._S._U. and his attainment of a B._A. degree , which had presumably prepared him for his career as district sales manager for Peerless_Business Machines.
     The one line on the bride said she was Miss_Lisa_Carmody from Baton_Rouge.
   No mention of New_Orleans.
     Hank was beginning to feel sharp concern for Mr._Black.
   If Mrs._Black was who he thought she was , Mr._Black 's Peerless selling days might well be over.
     Now for their exodus from Gulf_Springs.
   This time the search took twice_as long , cutting_down on his extra reading , for he had to pick through several columns of one - and two-line social notes in each issue.
   He found it in the edition of May 15.
   The item said Mr. and Mrs._Black had moved to Jackson , his home town - so the lovely Lisa had been with him a year ago.
     Next on his program was a call to the Jackson office of Peerless_Business Machines to find_out if Vincent_Black was still with them - or , more specifically , still with us.
     He glanced at his watch , saw it was only seven , and decided to indulge his weakness now.
   For the next hour he scrambled happily up_and_down the ladder , sharing the excitement of reporters who had seen McKinley 's assassination , the Iroquois_Theater fire in Chicago , and the Hall-Mills trial.
     In_the_middle of the stock_market crash , he heard a slight noise in the outer office.
   He turned_around , saw nothing , and decided it must be a mouse.
   Something else distracted him , yet there was no sound , only tomblike silence.
   Then he knew it was not sound , but lack of_it.
   The air conditioner was no_longer running.
     He jumped up and turned_around to see the metal door closing.
   It clanged shut as he sprang toward it.
     He pressed his face against the grille.
    Who 's there ?
     The light shining through the grille dimly illumined the office beyond - enough for him to see there was no one there.
   Then he heard the outer door closing.
      Hey , come_back  , he shouted.
   He thought it must be some damn janitor or cleaning_woman puttering_around , figuring that Hirey had gone off and forgotten to turn_off everything and lock_up.
     Then the faint beginnings of fear stirred in his mind.
   Unless he was stone-blind , the person who 'd just left could n't have missed seeing Hank through the open_door of the brightly lighted room.
   And even if he 'd somehow missed seeing him , he would n't have gone off and left the light on and door open in the file room.
     Whoever it was had meant to shut him up in here , had followed him and waited till the courthouse and square were deserted.
   But why?
   To search his room at the motel?
   To come_back later and kill him after the stores had closed around the square and everybody had left?
   No , they could kill him just_as easy right_now.
   Nobody could hear what was going_on in_this underground vault.
     Then he heard it and smelled it - the steady hissing , the dread , familiar pungency of gas escaping.
   It must be coming from an upright heater against the far wall in the supervisors ' office.
     Until_now , Lilac_Gaylor and Lila_Kingsley had been like an anagram which he could unscramble at his own pace and choosing.
     Except for those minutes in her room , he had lost touch with her as a reality.
   Gaylor 's obsession and Cunningham 's chimera-chasing reminiscences had mesmerized him into thinking_of Lila and Lilac , separately or together , as a legend.
   They kept drifting apart and merging again in his mind like some minute form of life on a microscope slide.
    
    This was not , for the Angel , just a matter of running_through a logical or deductive chain , or deciding on some action from some already established premise.
   No_doubt the Angels could do that kind_of thing as fast as any computer.
     What Gabriel was being asked to do now , however , was to re-examine all his basic_assumptions , make value-judgments on them , and give them new and different powers in his mind to govern his motives.
   This is not wholly a reasoning process - a computer cannot do it all - and even in an Angel it takes time.
   ( Or , perhaps , especially in an Angel , whose assumptions had mostly been fixed millions of years ago.
 )     Being reasonably sure of the reason for the long pause , however , did not make it seem any less long to Jack.
   He had already become used_to Hesperus ' snapping back answers to questions almost before Jack could get them asked.
     There was nothing he could do but wait.
   The dice were cast.
     At_last Gabriel spoke.
      We misjudged you  , he said slowly.
    We had concluded that no race as ephemeral as yours could have had time to develop a sense of justice.
   Of_course we have before_us the example of the great races at the galactic center ; individually they are nearly as mortal as you - the difference does not seem very marked to us , where it exists.
   But they have survived for long periods as races , whereas you are young.
   We shall recommend to them that they shorten your trial period by half.
      For_now , it is clear that we were in the wrong.
   You may reclaim your property , and the penalty on Hesperus is lifted.
   Hesperus , you may speak .
      I did not perceive this essential distinction either , First-Born  , Hesperus said at_once ,  I was only practicing a concept that Jack taught me , called a deal .
      Nevertheless , you were its agent.
   Jack , what is the nature of_this concept ?
      It 's a kind_of agreement in_which each party gives something to the other  , Jack said.
    We regard it as fair only when each party feels that what he has received is as valuable , or more valuable , than what he has given .
   His heart , he discovered , was pounding.
    For_instance , Hesperus agreed to help me find my property , and I agreed to take him to Earth.
   Between individuals , this process is called bargaining.
   When it is done between races or nations , it is called making a treaty.
   And the major part of my mission to your nest is to make a treaty between your race and mine.
   Recovering the property was much less important .
      Strange  , Gabriel said.
    And apparently impossible.
   Though it might be that we would have much to give you , you have nothing to give us .
      Hesperus and Lucifer  , Jack said ,  show that we do .
     Another pause ; but this one was not_nearly as long.
      Then it is a matter of pleasure ; of curiosity ; of a more alive time.
   Yes , those could be commodities under this concept.
   But you should understand , Jack , that Hesperus and Lucifer are not_long out of the nursery.
   Visiting the Earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are older .
     This explained a great_deal.
    All the more reason , then  , Jack said ,  why we must have a treaty.
   We will gladly entertain your young and give them proper living_quarters , in_return for their help in running our fusion_reactors.
   But we must know if this is in_accordance_with your customs , and must have your agreement they will not misuse the power we put in their hands , to our hurt .
      But this simply requires that they behave in_accordance_with the dictates of their own natures , and respect yours in_turn.
   To this we of_course agree .
     Jack felt a wave of complete elation , but in a second it had vanished without a trace.
   What Gabriel was asking was that mankind forego all its parochial moral judgments , and contract to let the Angels serve on Earth as_it_is in Heaven regardless_of the applicable Earth laws.
   The Angels in_turn would exercise similar restraints in respect for the natural preferences and natures of the Earthmen - but they had no faintest notion of man 's perverse habit of passing and enforcing laws which were contrary to his own preferences and violations of his nature.
     The simple treaty principle that Gabriel was asking him to ratify , in_short , was nothing less_than total trust.
     Nothing less would serve.
   And it might be , considering the uncomfortable custom the Angels had of thinking_of everything in_terms_of absolutes , that the proposal of anything less might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war.
     Furthermore , even the highly trained law clerk who was a part of Jack 's total make-up could not understand how the principle could ever be codified.
   Almost the whole experience of mankind pointed toward suspicion , not trust , as the safest and sanest attitude toward all outsiders.
     Yet there was some precedent for it.
   The history of disarmament agreements , for_instance , had been unreassuringly dismal ; but the United_States and the Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics nevertheless did eventually agree on an atomic_bomb test ban , and a sort_of provisional acceptance of each other 's good intentions on this limited question.
   Out of_that agreement , though not by any easy road , eventually emerged the present world hegemony of the United_Nations ; suspicion between member states still existed , but it was of about the same low order of virulence as the twentieth-century rivalry between Arizona and California over water_supplies.
     Besides , agreements  in_principle  , with the petty details to be thrashed_out later , were commonplace in diplomatic history.
   The trouble with them was that they almost never worked , and in_fact an agreement  in_principle  historically turned_out to be a sure sign that neither party really wanted the quarrel settled.
     Suppose that this one were to work?
   There was no question in Jack 's mind of the good faith on_one_side , at_least.
   If mankind could be convinced of that.
     It was worth trying.
   In_fact , it had_to be tried.
   It would be at_once the_most tentative and most final treaty that Earth had ever signed.
   Secretary_Hart had taught Jack , at_least partially , to be content with small beginnings in_all diplomatic matters ; but there was no small way to handle this one.
     He turned_back to the screens , the crucial , conclusive phrase on his lips.
   But he was too late.
   He had lost his audience.
     For a moment he could make no sense at_all of_what he saw.
   It seemed to be only a riot of color , light and meaningless activity.
   Gradually , he realized that the pentagon of Angel elders had vanished , and that the ritual learning dance of the nursery had been broken_up.
   The Angels in the nursery were zigzagging wildly in_all_directions , seemingly at_random.
      Hesperus!
   What 's going_on here?
   What 's happened ?
      Your brothers have been found.
   They are on their way here .
      Where?
   I do n't see them.
   The instruments do n't show them .
      You can n't see them yet , Jack.
   They 'll be in range in_a_short_while .
     Jack scanned the skies , the boards , and the skies again.
   Nothing.
   No - there was a tiny pip on the radar ; and it was getting bigger rapidly.
   If that was the skiff , it was making unprecedented speed.
     Then the skiff hove into sight , just a dot of light at_first against the roiling blackness and crimson streaks of the Coal_Sack.
   Through the telescope , Jack could see that both spacesuits were still attached to it.
   The sail was still unfurled , though there were a good many holes in it , as Langer had predicted would be the case by now.
     It was a startling , almost numenous sight ; but even more awesome was the fact that it was trailing an enormous comet 's - tail of Angels.
     The skiff was not heading for the nursery , however.
   It seemed unlikely that her crew , if either of them were alive , could even see the Ariadne , for they were passing her at_a_distance of nearly a light-year.
   And there would be no chance of signaling them - without the Nernst generator Jack could not send a call powerful enough to get_through all the static , and by the time he could rebuild his fusion power the skiff would be gone.
     Fuming , helpless , he watched them pass him.
   The sail , ragged though it was , still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of power being poured_out from the nursery stars.
   He would never have believed , without seeing it , that the bizarre little vessel could go so fast.
     But where was it going?
   And why was it causing so_much agitation among the Angels , and being followed by so many_of them?
     There was only one possible answer , but Jack 's horrified mind refused to believe it until he had fed the radar plots of the skiff 's course into the computer.
   The curve on the card the computer spat back at him could n't be argued with , however.
     The skiff was headed for the very center of the nebula - toward that place which , Jack knew now , could hold nothing less important than the very core of the Angel 's life and religion.
     It was clear that Langer had at_last found a way to attract the Angel 's attention.
     It was equally clear that as of_this moment , the treaty was off.
     Langer would have to be headed_off , whether he knew where he was going or not.
   Almost surely he did ; after_all , he had had the same set of facts as Jack had had to work from , and he was an almost frighteningly observant man.
   But not having talked to the Angels , he had made a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along the line.
   Had he decided , perhaps , that the center of the cloud was a center of government , instead of a center of life and faith ?
     But it did n't matter now whether he meant to invade the Holy_of_Holies , or was simply headed in_that direction by_accident.
   If it was intentional , it was now also unnecessary ; and whether intentional or not , the outcome would be disastrous.
     Jack crawled under the boards and restored the six feet of lead_line he had excised from the Nernst generator switch.
   When he was back on his feet again and about to reinstall the fuses , however , he hesitated.
     He had to have fusion power to catch_up_with the skiff , and he had to have it fast.
   But fusion power in the Coal_Sack was what had triggered all the trouble in_the_first_place - and he already had an Angel aboard.
      Hesperus ?
      Receiving .
      I 'm going_to turn my generator back on , as I promised to do.
   But I can n't take you to Earth yet.
   First I 've got_to intercept my brothers before they get any deeper into trouble.
   Will you obstruct this , or will you help?
   I know it 's not part of the bargain , and your elders might not like it .
      Nobody else can live in your hearth while I am in it  , Hesperus said promptly.
    As for my elders , they have already admitted that they were wrong.
   If because of_this incident they become angry with Earth , I will not be permitted to go there at_all.
   Therefore of_course I will help .
     With a short-lived sigh of relief , Jack plugged the fuses back in and threw the switch.
   Without an instant 's transition , the green_light that meant full fusion power winked on the board.
   Always before , it had taken five minutes to -     Of_course.
   Hesperus was in there.
   From here on out , the Ariadne was going_to be hotter than any space cruiser man had ever dreamed of.
     But since he had failed to anticipate it , he lost the five minutes anyhow , in plotting an intercept orbit.
      Hesperus , do n't use this t-tau vector trick of yours , please.
    
    Ryan hefted his bulk up and supported it on one elbow.
   He rubbed his eyes sleepily with one huge paw.
    Ekstrohm , Nogol , you guys okay ?
      Nothing wrong with me that could n't be cured  , Nogol said.
   He did n't say what would cure him ; he had been explaining all during the trip what he needed to make him feel like himself.
   His small black_eyes darted inside the olive oval of his face.
      Ekstrohm ?
   Ryan insisted.
      Okay .
      Well , let 's take a ground-level look at the country around here .
     The facsiport rolled open on the landscape.
   A range of bluffs hugged the horizon , the color of decaying moss.
   Above them , the sky was the black of space , or the almost equal black of the winter sky above Minneapolis , seen against neon-lit snow.
   That cold , empty sky was full of fire and light.
   It seemed almost a magnification of the Galaxy itself , of the Milky_Way , blown_up by some master photographer.
     This fiery swath was actually only a belt of minor_planets , almost like the asteroid belt in the original Solar_System.
   These planets were much bigger , nearly all capable_of holding an atmosphere.
   But to the infuriation of scientists , for no known reason not all_of them did.
   This would be the fifth mapping expedition to the planetoids of Yancy-6 in three generations.
   They lay months away from the nearest Earth star by jump drive , and no one knew what they were good for , although it was felt that they would probably be good for something if it could only be discovered - much like the continent of Antarctica in ancient history.
      How can a planet with so many neighbors be so lonely ?
   Ryan asked.
   He was the captain , so he could ask questions like that.
      Some can be lonely in a crowd  , Nogol said elaborately.
      What will we need outside , Ryan ?
   Ekstrohm asked.
      No helmets  , the captain answered.
    We can breathe out there , all_right.
   It just won n't be easy.
   This old world lost all_of its helium and trace gases long_ago.
   Nitrogen and oxygen are about it .
      Ryan , look over there  , Nogol said.
    Animals.
   Ringing the ship.
   Think they 're intelligent , maybe hostile ?
      I think they 're dead  , Ekstrohm interjected quietly.
    I get no readings from them at_all.
   Sonic , electronic , galvanic - all blank.
   According to these needles , they 're stone dead .
      Ekstrohm , you and I will have_a_look  , Ryan said.
    You hold_down_the_fort , Nogol.
   Take_it_easy .
      Easy  , Nogol confirmed.
    I heard a story once about a rookie who got excited when the captain stepped outside and he could n't get an encephalographic reading on him.
   Me , I know the mind of an officer works in a strange and unfathomable manner .
      I 'm not worried about you mis-reading the dials , Nogol , just_about a lug like you reading them at_all.
   Remember , when the little_hand is straight up that 's negative.
   Positive results start when it goes towards the hand you use to make your mark .
      But I 'm ambidextrous .
     Ryan told him what he could do then.
     Ekstrohm smiled , and followed the captain through the airlock with only a glance at the lapel gauge on his coverall.
   The strong negative field his suit set_up would help to repel bacteria and insects.
     Actually , the types of infection that could attack a warm-blooded mammal were not infinite , and over the course of the last few hundred years adequate defenses had been found for all basic categories.
   He was n't likely to come_down with hot chills and puzzling striped fever.
     They ignored the ladder down to the planet surface and , with only a glance at the seismological gauge to judge surface resistance , dropped to the ground.
     It was day , but in the thin atmosphere contrasts were sharp between light and shadow.
   They walked from midnight to noon , noon to midnight , and came to the beast sprawled on its side.
     Ekstrohm nudged it with a boot.
    Hey , this is pretty close_to a wart-hog .
      Uh-huh  , Ryan admitted.
    One of the best matches I 've ever found.
   Well , it has_to happen.
   Statistical average and all.
   Still , it sometimes gives you a creepy feeling to find a rabbit or a snapping_turtle on some strange world.
   It makes you wonder if this exploration business is n't all some big joke , and somebody has been everywhere before you even started .
     The surveyor looked sidewise at the captain.
   The big man seldom gave_out with such thoughts.
   Ekstrohm cleared his throat.
    What shall we do with this one?
   Dissect it ?
     Ryan nudged it with his toe , following Ekstrohm 's example.
    I do n't know , Stormy.
   It sure as hell does n't look_like any dominant intelligent species to me.
   No hands , for_one_thing.
   Of_course , that 's not definite proof .
      No , it is n't  , Ekstrohm said.
      I think we 'd better let it lay until we get a clearer picture of the ecological setup around here.
   In_the_meantime , we might be thinking on the problem all these dead beasts represent.
   What killed them ?
      It looks like we did , when we made blastdown .
      But what about our landing was lethal to the creatures ?
      Radiation ?
   Ekstrohm suggested.
    The planet is very low in radiation from mineral deposits , and the atmosphere seems to shield out most_of the solar output.
   Any little dose of radiation might knock_off these critters .
      I do n't know about that.
   Maybe it would work the other way.
   Maybe because they have had virtually no radioactive exposure and do n't have any R 's stored up , they could take a_lot without harm .
      Then maybe it was the shockwave we set_up.
   Or maybe it 's sheer xenophobia.
   They curl_up and die at the sight of something strange and alien - like a spaceship .
      Maybe  , the captain admitted.
    At this stage of the game anything could be possible.
   But there 's one possibility I particularly do n't like .
      And that is ?
      Suppose it was not us that killed these aliens.
   Suppose it is something right_on the planet , native to_it.
   I just hope it does n't work on Earthmen too.
   These critters went real sudden .
     Ekstrohm lay in his bunk and thought , the camp is quiet.
     The Earthmen made camp outside the spaceship.
   There was no reason to leave the comfortable quarters inside the ship , except that , faced with a possibility of sleeping on solid_ground , they simply had_to get_out.
     The camp was a cluster of aluminum bubbles , ringed with a spy web to alert the Earthmen to the approach of any being.
     Each man had a bubble to himself , privacy after the long period of enforced intimacy on_board the ship.
     Ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened to the sounds of the night on Yancey-6 138.
   There was a keening of wind , and a cracking of the frozen ground.
   Insects there were on the world , but they were frozen solid during the night , only to revive and thaw in the morning sun.
     The bunk he lay on was much more uncomfortable than the acceleration couches on_board.
   Yet he knew the others were sleeping more soundly , now that they had renewed their contact with the_matter that had birthed them to send them riding high vacuum.
     Ekstrohm was not asleep.
     Now there could be an end to pretending.
     He threw_off the light blanket and swung his feet off the bunk , to the floor.
   Ekstrohm stood_up.
     There was no_longer any need to hide.
   But what was there to do?
   What had changed for him?
     He no_longer had_to lie in his bunk all night , his eyes closed , pretending to sleep.
   In privacy he could walk_around , leave the light on , read.
     It was small comfort for insomnia.
     Ekstrohm never slept.
   Some doctors had informed him he was mistaken about this.
   Actually , they said , he did sleep , but so shortly and fitfully that he forgot.
   Others admitted he was absolutely correct - he never slept.
   His body_processes only slowed_down enough for him to dispel fatigue poisons.
   Occasionally he fell into a waking , gritty-eyed stupor ; but he never slept.
     Never at_all.
     Naturally , he could n't let his shipmates know this.
   Insomnia would ground him from the Exploration_Service , on physiological if_not psychological grounds.
   He had_to hide it.
     Over the years , he had had buddies in space in whom he thought he could confide.
   The buddies invariably took_advantage of him.
   Since he could n't sleep anyway , he might as_well stand their watches for them or write their reports.
   Where the hell did he get_off threatening to report any laxness on their part to the captain?
   A man with insomnia had_better avoid bad dreams of_that kind if he knew what was good for him.
     Ekstrohm had_to hide his secret.
     In a camp , instead of shipboard , hiding the secret was easier.
   But the secret itself was just_as hard.
     Ekstrohm picked_up a lightweight no-back from the ship 's library , a book by Bloch , the famous twentieth century expert on sex.
   He scanned a_few lines on the social repercussions of a celebrated nineteenth century sex murderer , but he could n't seem to concentrate on the weighty , pontifical , ponderous style.
     On impulse , he flipped up the heat control on his coverall and slid back the hatch of the bubble.
     Ekstrohm walked through the alien glass and looked up at the unfamiliar constellations , smelling the frozen sterility of the thin air.
     Behind him , his mates stirred without waking.
     Ekstrohm was startled in the morning by a banging on the hatch of his bubble.
   It took him a_few seconds to put his thoughts in_order , and_then he got_up from the bunk where he had been resting , sleeplessly.
     The angry burnt-red face of Ryan greeted him.
    Okay , Stormy , this is n't the place for fun and games.
   What did you do with them ?
      Do with what ?
      The dead beasties.
   All the dead_animals laying around the ship .
      What are you talking_about , Ryan?
   What do you think I did with them ?
      I do n't know.
   All I know is that they are gone .
      Gone ?
     Ekstrohm shouldered his way outside and scanned the veldt.
     There was no ring of animal corpses.
   Nothing.
   Nothing but wispy grass whipping in the keen breeze.
      I 'll be damned  , Ekstrohm said.
      You are right_now , buddy.
   ExPe does n't like anybody mucking_up primary evidence .
      Where do you get_off , Ryan ?
   Ekstrohm demanded.
    Why pick me for your patsy?
   This has_got_to be some kind_of local phenomenon.
   Why accuse a shipmate of being behind this ?
      Listen , Ekstrohm , I want to give you the benefit of every doubt.
   But you are n't exactly the model of a surveyor , you know.
   You 've been riding on a pink ticket for six years , you know that .
      No  , Ekstrohm said ,  No , I did n't know that .
      You 've been hiding things from me and Nogol every jump we 've made with you.
   Now comes this!
   It fits the pattern of secrecy and stealth you 've been involved in .
      What could I do with your lousy dead_bodies?
   What would I want with them ?
      All I know is that you were outside the bubbles last night , and you were the only sentient being who came_in or out of our alarm web.
   The tapes show that.
   Now all the bodies are missing , like they got_up and walked away .
     It was not a new experience to Ekstrohm.
   No.
   Suspicion was n't new_to him at_all.
      Ryan , there are other explanations for the disappearance of the bodies.
   Look_for them , will you?
   I give you my word I 'm not trying to pull some stupid kind_of joke , or to deliberately foul_up the expedition.
   Take my word , can n't you ?
     Ryan shook his head.
    I do n't think I can.
   There 's still such a thing as mental_illness.
   You may_not be responsible .
     Ekstrohm scowled.
      Do n't try anything violent , Stormy.
   I outweigh you fifty pounds and I 'm fast for a big man .
      I was n't planning on jumping you.
   Why do you have_to jump me the first time something goes_wrong?
    
    She lived and was given a name.
   Helva.
   For her first three vegetable months she waved her crabbed claws , kicked weakly with her clubbed feet and enjoyed the usual routine of the infant.
   She was not alone for there were three other such children in the big city 's special nursery.
   Soon they all were removed to Central_Laboratory_School where their delicate transformation began.
     One of the babies died in the initial transferral but of Helva 's  class  , seventeen thrived in the metal shells.
   Instead of kicking feet , Helva 's neural responses started her wheels ; instead of grabbing with hands , she manipulated mechanical extensions.
   As she matured , more_and_more neural synapses would be adjusted to operate other mechanisms that went_into the maintenance and running of a space ship.
   For Helva was destined to be the  brain  half of a scout ship , partnered with a man or a woman , whichever she chose , as the mobile half.
   She would be among the elite of her kind.
   Her initial intelligence_tests registered above normal and her adaptation index was unusually high.
   As long as her development within her shell lived_up_to expectations , and there were no side-effects from the pituitary tinkering , Helva would live a rewarding , rich and unusual life , a far cry from what she would have faced as an ordinary ,  normal  being.
     However , no diagram of her brain patterns , no early I._Q. tests recorded certain essential facts about Helva that Central must eventually learn.
   They would have to bide their official time and see , trusting that the massive doses of shell-psychology would suffice her , too , as the necessary bulwark against her unusual confinement and the pressures of her profession.
   A ship run by a human brain could not run rogue or insane with the power and resources Central had to build into their scout ships.
   Brain ships were , of_course , long past the experimental stages.
   Most babes survived the techniques of pituitary manipulation that kept their bodies small , eliminating the necessity of transfers from smaller to larger shells.
   And very , very_few were lost when the final connection was made to the control_panels of ship or industrial combine.
   Shell people resembled mature dwarfs in size whatever their natal deformities were , but the well-oriented brain would not have changed places with the_most perfect body in the Universe.
     So , for happy years , Helva scooted around in her shell with her classmates , playing such games as Stall , Power-Seek , studying her lessons in trajectory , propulsion techniques , computation , logistics , mental_hygiene , basic alien psychology , philology , space history , law , traffic , codes : all the et ceteras that eventually became compounded into a reasoning , logical , informed citizen.
   Not so obvious to her , but of more importance to her teachers , Helva ingested the precepts of her conditioning as easily as she absorbed her nutrient fluid.
   She would one_day be grateful to the patient drone of the sub-conscious-level instruction.
     Helva 's civilization was not without busy , do-good associations , exploring possible inhumanities to terrestrial as_well as extraterrestrial citizens.
   One such group got all incensed over shelled  children  when Helva was just turning fourteen.
   When they were forced to , Central Worlds shrugged its shoulders , arranged a tour of the Laboratory_Schools and set the tour off to a big start by showing the members case_histories , complete with photographs.
   Very_few committees ever looked past the first few photos.
   Most_of their original objections about  shells  were overridden by the relief that these hideous ( to them ) bodies were mercifully concealed.
     Helva 's class was doing Fine_Arts , a selective subject in her crowded program.
   She had activated one of her microscopic tools which she would later use for minute repairs to various parts of her control_panel.
   Her subject was large - a copy of the Last_Supper - and her canvas , small - the head of a tiny screw.
   She had tuned her sight to the proper degree.
   As she worked she absentmindedly crooned , producing a curious sound.
   Shell people used their own vocal_cords and diaphragms but sound issued through microphones rather_than mouths.
   Helva 's hum then had a curious vibrancy , a warm , dulcet quality even in its aimless chromatic wanderings.
      Why , what a lovely voice you have  , said one of the female visitors.
     Helva  looked  up and caught a fascinating panorama of regular , dirty craters on a flaky pink surface.
   Her hum became a gurgle of surprise.
   She instinctively regulated her  sight  until the skin lost its cratered look and the pores assumed normal proportions.
      Yes , we have quite_a_few years of voice training , madam  , remarked Helva calmly.
    Vocal peculiarities often become excessively irritating during prolonged intra-stellar distances and must be eliminated.
   I enjoyed my lessons .
     Although this was the first time that Helva had seen unshelled people , she took this experience calmly.
   Any other reaction would have been reported instantly.
      I meant that you have a nice singing_voice , dear  , the lady amended.
      Thank_you.
   Would you like to see my work ?
   Helva asked , politely.
   She instinctively sheered away from personal discussions but she filed the comment away for further meditation.
      Work ?
 asked the lady.
      I am currently reproducing the Last_Supper on the head of a screw .
      O , I say  , the lady twittered.
     Helva turned her vision back to magnification and surveyed her copy critically.
      Of_course , some of my color values do not match the old_Master 's and the perspective is faulty but I believe it to be a fair_copy .
     The lady 's eyes , unmagnified , bugged_out.
      Oh , I forget  , and Helva 's voice was really contrite.
   If she could have blushed , she would have.
    You people do n't have adjustable vision .
     The monitor of_this discourse grinned with_pride and amusement as Helva 's tone indicated pity for the unfortunate.
      Here , this will help  , suggested Helva , substituting a magnifying device in one extension and holding it over the picture.
     In a kind_of shock , the ladies and gentlemen of the committee bent to observe the incredibly copied and brilliantly executed Last_Supper on the head of a screw.
      Well  , remarked one gentleman who had been forced to accompany his wife ,  the good Lord can eat where angels fear to tread .
      Are you referring , sir  , asked Helva politely ,  to the Dark_Age discussions of the number of angels who could stand on the head of a pin ?
      I had that in mind .
      If you substitute ' atom ' for ' angel ' , the problem is not insoluble , given the metallic content of the pin in_question .
      Which you are programed to compute ?
      Of_course .
      Did they remember to program a sense_of_humor , as_well , young_lady ?
      We are directed to develop a sense of proportion , sir , which contributes the same effect .
     The good man chortled appreciatively and decided the trip was worth his time.
     If the investigation committee spent months digesting the thoughtful food served them at the Laboratory_School , they left Helva with a morsel as_well.
      Singing  as applicable to herself required research.
   She had , of_course , been exposed to and enjoyed a music appreciation course which had included the better known classical works such_as  Tristan und Isolde  ,  Candide  ,  Oklahoma  ,  Nozze de Figaro  , the atomic age singers , Eileen_Farrell , Elvis_Presley and Geraldine_Todd , as_well as the curious rhythmic progressions of the Venusians , Capellan visual chromatics and the sonic concerti of the Altairians.
   But  singing  for any shell person posed considerable technical difficulties to be overcome.
   Shell people were schooled to examine every aspect of a problem or situation before making a prognosis.
   Balanced properly between optimism and practicality , the nondefeatist attitude of the shell people led them to extricate themselves , their ships and personnel , from bizarre situations.
   Therefore to Helva , the problem that she could n't open her mouth to sing , among other restrictions , did not bother her.
   She would work_out a method , by-passing her limitations , whereby she could sing.
     She approached the problem by investigating the methods of sound_reproduction through the centuries , human and instrumental.
   Her own sound production equipment was essentially more instrumental than vocal.
   Breath control and the proper enunciation of vowel_sounds within the oral_cavity appeared to require the_most development and practice.
   Shell people did not , strictly_speaking , breathe.
   For their purposes , oxygen and other gases were not drawn from the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained artificially by solution in their shells.
   After experimentation , Helva discovered that she could manipulate her diaphragmic unit to sustain tone.
   By relaxing the throat muscles and expanding the oral_cavity well into the frontal_sinuses , she could direct the vowel_sounds into the_most felicitous position for proper reproduction through her throat microphone.
   She compared the results with tape_recordings of modern singers and was not unpleased although her own tapes had a peculiar quality about them , not_at_all unharmonious , merely unique.
   Acquiring a repertoire from the Laboratory library was no problem to one trained to perfect recall.
   She found herself able to sing any role and any song which struck her fancy.
   It would not have occurred to her that it was curious for a female to sing bass , baritone , tenor , alto , mezzo , soprano and coloratura as she pleased.
   It was , to Helva , only a matter of the correct reproduction and diaphragmic control required by the music attempted.
     If the authorities remarked on her curious avocation , they did so among themselves.
   Shell people were encouraged to develop a hobby so_long as they maintained proficiency in their technical work.
     On the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her shell , Helva was unconditionally graduated and installed in her ship , the XH-834.
   Her permanent titanium shell was recessed behind an even more indestructible barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship.
   The neural , audio , visual and sensory connections were made and sealed.
   Her extendibles were diverted , connected or augmented and the final , delicate-beyond-description brain taps were completed while Helva remained anesthetically unaware_of the proceedings.
   When she awoke , she was the ship.
   Her brain and intelligence controlled every function from navigation to such loading as a scout ship of her class needed.
   She could take_care of herself and her ambulatory half , in any situation already recorded in the annals of Central Worlds and any situation its most fertile minds could imagine.
     Her first actual flight , for she and her kind had made mock flights on dummy panels since she was eight , showed her complete mastery of the techniques of her profession.
   She was ready for her great adventures and the arrival of her mobile partner.
     There were nine qualified scouts sitting around collecting base pay the day Helva was commissioned.
   There were several missions which demanded instant attention but Helva had been of interest to several department_heads in Central for_some_time and each man was determined to have her assigned to his section.
   Consequently no one had remembered to introduce Helva to the prospective partners.
   The ship always chose its own partner.
   Had there been another  brain  ship at the Base at the moment , Helva would have been guided to make the first move.
   As it was , while Central wrangled among itself , Robert_Tanner sneaked_out of the pilots ' barracks , out to the field and over to Helva 's slim metal hull.
      Hello , anyone at_home ?
   Tanner wisecracked.
      Of_course  , replied Helva logically , activating her outside scanners.
    Are you my partner ?
 she asked hopefully , as she recognized the Scout_Service uniform.
      All you have to do is ask  , he retorted hopefully.
      No one has come.
   I thought perhaps there were no partners available and I 've had no directives from Central .
     Even to herself Helva sounded a_little self-pitying but the truth was she was lonely , sitting on the darkened field.
   Always she had had the company of other shells and more recently , technicians by the score.
   The sudden solitude had lost its momentary charm and become oppressive.
      No directives from Central is scarcely a cause for regret , but there happen to be eight other guys biting their fingernails to the quick just waiting for an invitation to board you , you beautiful thing .
    
    It would have killed you in the cabin.
   Do you have anything for me ?
     Mercer stammered , not knowing what B ' dikkat meant , and the two-nosed man answered for him ,  I think he has a nice baby head , but it is n't big enough for you to take yet .
     Mercer never noticed the needle touch his arm.
     B ' dikkat had turned_to the next knot of people when the super-condamine hit Mercer.
     He tried to run after B ' dikkat , to hug the lead spacesuit , to tell B ' dikkat that he loved him.
   He stumbled and fell , but it did not hurt.
     The many-bodied girl lay near him.
   Mercer spoke_to her.
      Is n't it wonderful?
   You 're beautiful , beautiful , beautiful.
   I 'm so happy to be here .
     The woman covered with growing hands came and sat beside them.
   She radiated warmth and good_fellowship.
   Mercer thought that she looked very distinguished and charming.
   He struggled out of his clothes.
   It was foolish and snobbish to wear clothing when none of these nice people did.
     The two women babbled and crooned at him.
     With one corner of his mind he knew that they were saying nothing , just expressing the euphoria of a drug so powerful that the known universe had forbidden it.
   With most_of his mind he was happy.
   He wondered how anyone could have the good_luck to visit a planet as nice as this.
   He tried to tell the Lady_Da , but the words were n't quite straight.
     A painful stab hit him in the abdomen.
   The drug went_after the pain and swallowed it.
   It was like the cap in the hospital , only a_thousand_times better.
   The pain was gone , though it had been crippling the first time.
     He forced himself to be deliberate.
   He rammed his mind into focus and said to the two ladies who lay pinkly nude beside him in the desert ,  That was a good bite.
   Maybe I will grow another head.
   That would make B ' dikkat happy !
     The Lady_Da forced the foremost of her bodies in an upright position.
   Said she ,  I 'm strong , too.
   I can talk.
   Remember , man , remember.
   People never live forever.
   We can die , too , we can die like real people.
   I do so believe_in death !
     Mercer smiled at her through his happiness.
      Of_course you can.
   But is n't this nice .
     With this he felt his lips thicken and his mind go slack.
   He was wide awake , but he did not feel_like doing anything.
   In_that beautiful place , among all those companionable and attractive people , he sat and smiled.
     B ' dikkat was sterilizing his knives.
     Mercer wondered how long the super-condamine had lasted him.
   He endured the ministrations of the dromozoa without screams or movement.
   The agonies of nerves and itching of skin were phenomena which happened somewhere near him , but meant nothing.
   He watched his own body with remote , casual interest.
   The Lady_Da and the hand-covered woman stayed near him.
   After a long_time the half-man dragged himself over to the group with his powerful arms.
   Having arrived he blinked sleepily and friendlily at them , and lapsed back into the restful stupor from which he had emerged.
   Mercer saw the sun rise on_occasion , closed his eyes briefly , and opened them to see stars shining.
   Time had no meaning.
   The dromozoa fed him in their mysterious way ; the drug canceled_out his needs for cycles of the body.
     At_last he noticed a return of the inwardness of pain.
     The pains themselves had not changed ; he had.
     He knew all the events which could take_place on Shayol.
   He remembered them well from his happy period.
   Formerly he had noticed them - now he felt them.
     He tried to ask the Lady_Da how long they had had the drug , and_how much longer they would have to wait before they had it again.
   She smiled at him with benign , remote happiness ; apparently her many torsos , stretched_out along the ground , had a greater capacity for retaining the drug than did his body.
   She meant him well , but was in no condition for articulate speech.
     The half-man lay on the ground , arteries pulsating prettily behind the half-transparent film which protected his abdominal_cavity.
     Mercer squeezed the man 's shoulder.
     The half-man woke , recognized Mercer and gave him a healthily sleepy grin.
      ' A good morrow to you , my boy '.
   That 's out of a play.
   Did you ever see a play ?
      You mean a game with cards ?
      No  , said the half-man ,  a sort_of eye-machine with real people doing the figures .
      I never saw that  , said Mercer ,  but I  -      But you want to ask me when B ' dikkat is going_to come_back with the needle .
      Yes  , said Mercer , a_little ashamed of his obviousness.
      Soon  , said the half-man.
   That 's why I think_of plays.
   We all know what is going_to happen.
   We all know when it is going_to happen.
   We all know what the dummies will do  - he gestured at the hummocks in_which the decorticated men were cradled -  and we all know what the new people will ask.
   But we never know how long a scene is going_to take .
      What 's a ' scene  '?
 asked Mercer.
    Is that the name for the needle ?
     The half-man laughed with something close_to real humor.
    No , no , no.
   You 've got the lovelies on the brain.
   A scene is just a part of a play.
   I mean we know the order in_which things happen , but we have no clocks and nobody cares enough to count days or to make calendars and there 's not_much climate here , so none of us know how long anything takes.
   The pain seems short and the pleasure seems long.
   I 'm inclined to think that they are about two Earth-weeks each .
     Mercer did not know what an  Earth-week  was , since he had not been a well-read man before his conviction , but he got nothing more from the half-man at_that_time.
   The half-man received a dromozootic implant , turned red in the face , shouted senselessly at Mercer ,  Take it out , you fool!
   Take it out of me !
     When Mercer looked_on helplessly , the half-man twisted over on his side , his pink dusty back turned to Mercer , and wept hoarsely and quietly to himself.
     Mercer himself could not tell how long it was before B ' dikkat came_back.
   It might have been several days.
   It might have been several months.
     Once_again B ' dikkat moved among them like a father ; once_again they clustered like children.
   This time B ' dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had grown out of Mercer 's thigh - a sleeping child 's head , covered with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes.
   Mercer got the blissful needle.
     When B ' dikkat cut the head from Mercer 's thigh , he felt the knife grinding against the cartilage which held the head to his own body.
   He saw the child-face grimace as the head was cut ; he felt the far , cool flash of unimportant pain , as B ' dikkat dabbed the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which stopped all bleeding immediately.
     The next time it was two legs growing from his chest.
     Then there had been another head beside his own.
     Or was that after the torso and legs , waist to toe-tips , of the little girl which had grown from his side?
     He forgot the order.
     He did not count time.
     Lady_Da smiled at him often , but there was no love in_this_place.
   She had lost the extra torsos.
   In_between teratologies , she was a pretty and shapely woman ; but the nicest thing about their relationship was her whisper to him , repeated some thousands of time , repeated with smiles and hope ,  People never live forever .
     She found this immensely comforting , even_though Mercer did not make much sense out of_it.
     Thus events occurred , and victims changed in appearance , and new ones arrived.
   Sometimes B ' dikkat took the new ones , resting in the everlasting sleep of their burned-out brains , in a ground-truck to be added to other herds.
   The bodies in the truck threshed and bawled without human speech when the dromozoa struck them.
     Finally , Mercer did manage to follow B ' dikkat to the door of the cabin.
   He had to fight the bliss of super-condamine to do_it.
   Only the memory of previous hurt , bewilderment and perplexity made him sure that if he did not ask B ' dikkat when he , Mercer , was happy , the answer would no_longer be available when he needed it.
   Fighting pleasure itself , he begged B ' dikkat to check the records and to tell him how long he had been there.
     B ' dikkat grudgingly agreed , but he did not come_out of the doorway.
   He spoke through the public address box built into the cabin , and his gigantic voice roared out over the empty plain , so_that the pink herd of talking people stirred gently in their happiness and wondered what their friend B ' dikkat might be wanting to tell them.
   When he said it , they thought it exceedingly profound , though none of them understood it , since it was simply the amount_of_time that Mercer had been on Shayol :      Standard years - eighty-four years , seven months , three days , two hours , eleven and one half minutes.
   Good_luck , fellow .
     Mercer turned_away.
     The secret little corner of his mind , which stayed sane through happiness and pain , made him wonder about B ' dikkat.
   What persuaded the cow-man to remain on Shayol?
   What kept him happy without super-condamine?
   Was B ' dikkat a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a man who had hopes of going_back to his own planet some_day , surrounded by a family of little cow-people resembling himself?
   Mercer , despite his happiness , wept a_little at the strange fate of B ' dikkat.
   His own fate he accepted.
     He remembered the last time he had eaten - actual eggs from an actual pan.
   The dromozoa kept him alive , but he did not know how they did it.
     He staggered back to the group.
   The Lady_Da , naked in the dusty plain , waved a hospitable hand and showed that there was a place for him to sit beside her.
   There were unclaimed square_miles of seating space around them , but he appreciated the kindliness of her gesture none the less.
     The years , if they were years , went_by.
   The land of Shayol did not change.
     Sometimes the bubbling sound of geysers came faintly across the plain to the herd of men ; those who could talk declared it to be the breathing of Captain_Alvarez.
   There was night and day , but no setting of crops , no change of season , no generations of men.
   Time stood_still for these people , and their load of pleasure was so commingled with the shocks and pains of the dromozoa that the words of the Lady_Da took_on very remote meaning.
      People never live forever .
     Her statement was a hope , not a truth in_which they could believe.
   They did not have the wit to follow the stars in their courses , to exchange names with each other , to harvest the experience of each for the wisdom of all.
   There was no dream of escape for these people.
   Though they saw the old-style chemical rockets lift_up from the field beyond B ' dikkat 's cabin , they did not make plans to hide among the frozen crop of transmuted flesh.
     Far long_ago , some other prisoner than one of these had tried to write a letter.
   His handwriting was on a rock.
   Mercer read it , and so had a_few of the others , but they could not tell which man had done it.
   Nor did they care.
     The letter , scraped on stone , had been a message home.
   They could still read the opening :  Once , I was like you , stepping_out of my window at the end of day , and letting the winds blow me gently toward the place I lived in.
   Once , like you , I had one head , two hands , ten fingers on my hands.
   The front part of my head was called a face , and I could talk with_it.
   Now I can only write , and that only when I get out of pain.
    
    Dan_Morgan told himself he would forget Ann_Turner.
   He was well rid of her.
   He certainly did n't want a wife who was fickle as Ann.
   If he had married her , he 'd have been asking_for trouble.
     But all_of this was rationalization.
   Sometimes he woke_up in_the_middle of the night thinking_of Ann , and_then could not get_back to sleep.
   His plans and dreams had revolved_around her so_much and for so_long that now he felt as if he had nothing.
   The easiest thing would be to sell_out to Al_Budd and leave the country , but there was a stubborn streak in him that would n't allow it.
     The best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard_work.
   He found that if he was tired enough at night , he went_to_sleep simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake.
   Each_day he found himself thinking less often of Ann ; each_day the hurt was a_little duller , a_little less poignant.
     He had plenty of work to do.
   Because the summer was unusually dry and hot , the spring produced a smaller stream than in ordinary years.
   The grass in the meadows came fast , now that the warm weather was here.
   He could not afford to lose a drop of the precious water , so he spent most_of his waking hours along the ditches in his meadows.
     He had no idea how much time Budd would give him.
   In_any_case , he had no intention of being caught asleep , so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip and he took his Winchester with him and leaned it against the fence.
   He stopped every few minutes and leaned_on his shovel as he studied the horizon , but nothing happened , each_day dragging_out with monotonous calm.
     When , in late afternoon on the last_day in June , he saw two people top the ridge to_the_south and walk toward the house , he quit work immediately and strode to his rifle.
   It could be some kind_of trick Budd had thought_up.
   No one walked in_this country , least_of_all Ed_Dow or Dutch Renfro or any of the rest of the Bar_B crew.
   Morgan watched the two figures for a time , puzzled.
   When they were closer and he saw that one was a woman , he was more puzzled than ever.
     He cleaned his shovel , left it against the fence , picked_up his Winchester , and started downstream.
   His visitors had crawled through the south fence and were crossing the meadow , angling toward the house.
   Now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and irregularly , staggering , as if they found it a struggle to remain on their feet.
     Reaching the house ahead of them , he waited with his Winchester in his hands.
   They crawled through the north fence and came_on toward him , and now he saw that both were young , not more_than nineteen or twenty.
   They were dirty , their clothes were torn , and the girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from the front_door.
   She lay there , making no effort to get_back on her feet.
   The boy came on to the porch and sat_down , his gaze on Morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring.
     Morgan hesitated , thinking that if this was a trick , it was a good one.
   He did n't think it was possible for this couple to be pretending.
   The boy licked his dry lips.
   He asked ,  Could we have a drink ?
     Morgan jerked his head toward_the_front door.
    In the kitchen  , he said.
   Leaning his Winchester against the front of the house , he walked to the girl.
    Get_up.
   There 's water in the house .
     She did n't move or say anything.
   Her eyes were glazed as if she did n't hear or even see him.
   She had reached a point at which she did n't even care how she looked.
   Her face was very thin , and burned by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling , the new skin under_it red and angry.
     Her blond hair was frowzy , her dress torn in_several_places , and her shoes were so completely worn_out that they were practically no protection.
   It must have hurt her even to walk , for the sole was completely off her left foot and Morgan saw that it was bruised and bleeding.
     He picked her up , sliding one hand under her shoulders , the other under her knees , and carried her into the house.
   She was amazingly light , and so relaxed in his arms that he was n't even sure she was conscious.
   Any lingering suspicion that this was a trick Al_Budd had thought_up was dispelled.
   No girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him.
   Besides , she had a sweet face that attracted him.
     He put her down on the couch , and going_into the kitchen , saw that the boy had dropped into a chair beside the table.
   They looked a good_deal alike , Morgan thought.
   Both had blonde hair and blue eyes , and there was even a faint similarity of features.
     Morgan filled the dipper from the water bucket on the shelf , went_back into the front_room , lifted the girl 's head , and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth.
   She drank greedily , and murmured ,  Thank_you  , as he lowered her head.
     He stood looking down at her for a moment , wondering what could have reduced her to this condition.
   He had seen a_few nester wagons go through the country , the families almost starving to death , but he had never seen any of them on_foot and as bad off as these two.
     The girl dropped_off to sleep.
   Morgan returned to the kitchen , built a fire , and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured into the copper boiler that he had placed on the stove.
   He brought his Winchester in from the front of the house , then faced the boy.
      Who are you and what happened to you ?
 he asked.
      I 'm Billy_Jones  , the boy answered.
    That 's my wife Sharon.
   We ran_out of money and we have n't eaten for two days .
      What are you doing here ?
      Are we in Wyoming ?
     Morgan nodded.
    About five miles north of the line .
     Jones sighed as if relieved.
    We 've been looking_for work , but all the ranchers have turned us down .
      You mean you dragged your wife all_over hell 's half-acre looking_for work ?
   Morgan demanded.
    The town of Buckhorn 's only about six miles from here.
   Why did n't you go there ?
      We did n't want town work  , Jones said.
      This is a mighty empty country  , Morgan said.
    There 's only one more ranch three miles north of here.
   You 'd have starved to death if you 'd missed both places .
      Then we 're lucky we got here.
   Could you give us a job , Mr. - - .
      Morgan.
   Dan_Morgan .
     He was silent a moment , thinking he could use a man this time_of_year , and if the girl could cook , it would give him more time in the meadows , but he knew nothing about the couple.
   They might kill him in his sleep , thinking there was money in the house.
   He dismissed the possibility at_once.
   The girl 's thin face haunted him.
   It was n't the face of a killer.
   He was n't so sure about the boy.
   He had n't shaved for several weeks , his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic , woebegone expression.
     There was more to this than Jones had told him.
   They were running from something.
   He 'd be an idiot to let them stay he thought , but he could n't send them on , either.
      I could use some help  , Morgan said finally ,  but I can n't afford to pay you anything.
   I guess you 'd better go_on in the morning .
      We 'll work for our keep  , the boy said eagerly.
    I 've been mucking in a mine in the San_Juan , but I used_to work on a ranch.
   Sharon , she 's cooked in a restaurant.
   We 'll work hard , Mr._Morgan .
      I 'll see  , Morgan said.
    Right_now you need a meal and a bath.
   Your wife 's in terrible shape .
      I know  , Jones said dejectedly.
     Morgan filled the fire box with wood again , then started supper and set the table.
   When the meal was ready , he told Jones to wash_up , and going_into the front_room , woke the girl.
   He said ,  I 've got some supper ready .
     She rubbed her eyes and stretched , then sat_up , her hands going_to her hair.
    I 'm a mess  , she said , and suddenly she was alarmed.
    Who are you?
   How did we get here ?
      I 'm Dan_Morgan.
   This is the Rafter_M.
   You fell_down in_front of the house , and I carried you in.
   I gave you a drink and_then you went_to_sleep .
      Oh .
   She stared at him , her eyes wide as she thought_about what he had said ; then she murmured :  You 're very kind , Mr._Morgan.
   Do you take_in all the strays who come_by ?
      I do n't have many strays coming to my front_door  , he said.
    Think you can walk to the table ?
      Of_course .
     She got to her feet , staggered , and almost fell.
   He caught her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen.
   She sat_down at the table , shaking her head.
    I 'm sorry , Mr._Morgan.
   I 'm usually a very strong woman , but I 'm awfully tired .
      And hungry  , he said.
    Start in.
   It 's not_much of a meal , but it 's what I eat .
      Not_much of a meal ?
 the girl cried.
    Mr. Morgan , it 's the best-looking food I ever saw .
     He told himself he had never seen two people eat so_much.
   When they were finally satisfied , Jones said ,  I think he 's going_to give us work .
     The grateful way she looked at Morgan made him ashamed of himself.
   When he saw the expression in her eyes , he knew he could n't send them on.
   She said ,  I guess the Lord looks_out for fools , drunkards , and innocents .
     Morgan laughed.
    Which are you ?
      We 're not drunkards  , she said.
    That 's all I 'm sure of .
     She helped him with the dishes , then he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark.
   He carried the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a nail in the wall.
   He said :  You 'll feel a_lot better after you have a bath.
   Your feet are in bad shape , Mrs._Jones.
   You 'll have to go_to town to see the doc .
      No , she 'll be all_right  , Jones said quickly.
    I mean , we do n't have any way to get there and we can n't expect you to quit work just to take us to town .
      We 'll see  , Morgan said.
      Could you find me a needle and thread ?
 the girl asked.
    My dress needs some work on it .
     He nodded and , going_into the bedroom , brought a needle , thread , and scissors.
   He said :  I 'm going_to_bed .
   He nodded at the door in_front of him.
    That 's my spare bedroom.
   The bed is n't made , but you 'll find plenty of blankets there .
      You 're awfully kind  , the girl said.
    We 'll pay you back if you 'll let us.
   Some way .
      It 's all_right  , he said.
    I get_up early.
   You 'd better sleep .
     Jones followed him into the front_room , closing the door behind him.
   He said :  If it 's all_right with you , Mr._Morgan , I 'll sleep out here on the couch.
   We have n't slept together since we started.
   I just can n't take any chances on getting her pregnant , and if we were sleeping together & & & .
     He stopped , embarrassed , and Morgan said ,  I understand that , but I do n't savvy why you 'd go_off and leave your jobs in_the_first_place .
      We got fired  , Jones said.
    We had to do something .
     They were a pair of lost , whipped kids , Morgan thought as he went_to_bed.
    
    Gavin paused wearily.
    You can n't stay here with me.
   It 's late and you said they 'd be here by dawn .
      You can n't make me go .
     Gavin sank down again into his chair and began to rock.
   He was thinking_of Rittenhouse and_how he had left him there , to rock to death on the porch of the Splendide.
   It was the only thing in his life for which he felt guilt.
   Beneath his black shirt his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat , the stored pain shattering free in slow gasps , terrible to see.
   Clayton tried to call_back the face of the man he had known.
   Against that other man he could rally his anger ; against this bent man in the chair he was powerless.
     Gavin 's lips moved so_that Clayton had to stoop to catch the words.
    Do you remember Big_Charlie ?
   he whispered.
    He stuck_with me all these years.
   Just a half-breed ' pache , never said much , never meant anythin to me , but he stuck_with me.
   He got_into a fight with Tom_English , your brother 's son.
   It was a fair fight , the boy provoked it - Big_Charlie told me so.
   I believed him.
   They killed Big_Charlie , dumped his body in my rose_garden two nights ago.
   My men , they all left me.
   Just cleared_out.
   I did n't understand why , Clay.
   They just all cleared_out.
   I treated them fair .
     He wiped his lips with a sleeve , then stared at Clayton in a childish kind_of wonder.
    Do you mean  - he asked almost shyly -  you want me to go_with you , wherever you 're goin ?
      Yes .
      You do n't hate me any_more ?
     Clayton choked , shook his head , murmuring ,  No .
      Come here .
   The old_man beckoned with one finger and Clayton went_forward to him.
   Gavin slipped his arms around his chest and hugged him fiercely.
    All my life  , he said ,  I tried.
   I tried.
   I saw you driftin away - but I tried.
   And you wanted no part of me when I had so_much to give.
   Now there 's nothin left of me.
   Laurel is gone , my men are gone , Ed is dead - and you come to me , to help me.
   Oh!
   God in Heaven , I can n't refuse you now.
   That would mock me too_much!
   Ca n't let you go way from me again .
   He closed his eyes , ashamed of his tears.
      I 'll go , Clay .
     Clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back.
   The eyes followed him fearfully.
    The horses.
   There is n't much time.
   I 'll saddle the horses and bring them round.
   You get ready .
     He burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold night air.
   Gavin 's stallion was in the barn and he tightened the cinches over the saddle_blanket , working by_touch in the darkness , comforting the animal with easy words.
   When he had finished he led him and the mare to the porch.
   The stallion had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to paw the turf , shaking his head.
   Clayton looped the reins in a knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his neck.
   The mare had backed_away.
    You take_it_easy , boy  , Clayton whispered.
    She does n't want you now.
   You take_it_easy , your time will come .
     Gavin stood on the porch , a thin figure.
   He had taken a carbine down from the wall and it trailed from his hand , the stock bumping on the wood floor.
   Clayton called to him and he came slowly down the steps.
      Clay  , he said ,  where are we goin ?
      To a ranch in the valley.
   There 's someone there I have_to see.
   We may take her with us - to California.
   I do n't know yet , it 's crazy ; I have_to think_about it.
   But California is where we 're goin .
      California .
   Gavin began to nod.
    That 's a new land.
   A man could make a mark there.
   two men , together like us , we could do somethin fine out there , maybe find a place where no one 's ever been.
   Start_out fresh , the two of us , like nothin had ever happened .
      Yes , like a father and son .
      I made you what you are  , Gavin whispered.
    I made you so you could stand_up.
   I made you a man .
      Yes , Gavin , you did .
     He approached the horse and laid a hand on the stallion 's quivering neck.
    Help me up , Clay.
   Help me up , I feel kind_of stiff .
   Clayton lifted him gently into the saddle , like a child.
    I hate to leave my garden  , Gavin said.
    They 'll trample it down.
   I loved my garden .
      It will grow again - in California .
      I loved this valley  , he whispered huskily.
    Lived alone here for three years , before any man came.
   Lived alone by the river.
   It was nice then , so peaceful and quiet.
   There was no one but me.
   I do n't want to leave it .
     Clayton swung into the saddle and whacked the stallion 's rump.
   The two horses broke from the yard , from the circle of light cast by the lamp still burning in the house , into the darkness.
     They rode at a measured pace through the valley.
   Dawn would come soon and the night was at its coldest.
   The moon had sunk below the black crest of the mountains and the land , seen through eyes that had grown accustomed_to the absence of light , looked primeval , as if no man had ever trespassed before.
   It looked as Gavin had first seen it years ago , on those nights when he slept alone by his campfire and waked suddenly to the hoot of an owl or the rustle of a blade of grass in the moon 's wind - a savage land , untenanted and brooding , too strong to be broken by the will of men.
   Gavin sighed bitterly.
   In_that inert landscape the caravan of his desires passed before his mind.
   He saw them ambushed , strewn in the postures of the broken and the dying.
   In_vain his mind groped to reassemble the bones of the relationships he had sought so desperately , but they would not come_to_life.
   The silence oppressed him , made him bend low over the horse 's neck as if to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its slow search.
     They passed ranches that were framed dark gray against the black hills.
   Then at_last the darkness began to dissolve.
   A bold line of violet broke_loose from the high ridge of the mountains , followed by feathers of red that swept the last stars from the sky.
   The wan light spread_over the ground and the valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences and palely shadowed gullies.
     They had been seen as soon as they left the ranch , picked_out of the darkness by the weary though watchful eyes of two men posted a_few hundred yards away in the windless shelter of the trees.
   The two men whipped their horses into town and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon , crying their intelligence.
     The men in Pettigrew 's were tired from a night 's drinking , their faces red and baggy.
   But the liquor had flushed their courage.
   They greeted the news angrily , as though they had been cheated of purpose.
   Lester heard their muttering , saw their eyes reveal their desire.
   He worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came_out of his throat , dry and cracked.
    He 's leavin.
   That 's what you wanted , is n't it?
   Clayton is with him , takin him out of the valley.
   You can n't  -      Keep_out of_this  , Purvis snarled.
    He 's not your brother , he 's Gavin 's son.
   You see , he lied to us when he said he was leavin alone .
     Joe_Purvis was thinking_back many years.
   First he thought_of the time he had ridden to Gavin and told him how his cattle were being rustled at the far end of the valley.
   He remembered Gavin 's smirk , his own cringing feeling , his impotence.
   Then he thought_of a time when Clayton 's horse had fallen lame in the Gap.
   His wife had said to him :  Nellie is in_love with Clayton_Roy.
   He would n't even dance with her at Gavin 's party.
   He treats her like she was dirt.
   And you stand_by like a fool and let him do it .
     He remembered Clayton 's mocking smile in the saloon when he had asked him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water.
   It was the night Clayton had tricked them in the poker_game.
    You 're Gavin 's son  , Joe_Purvis had said.
     He turned_to Lester.
    You brought him back to this valley thinkin he would help you find your boy.
   He meant to help Gavin all_the_time.
   He made a fool of you , Lester .
   He swung round to the other men -  We can catch him easy!
   There are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place.
   If we let them go , they won n't stay away , they 'll find men to ride with them and they 'll be back.
   There 's only one way they can get_out now and that 's through the Gap - if we ride hard we can take them .
     Lester 's hand fluttered to Cabot 's shoulder.
   The boy jerked away.
      He killed Tom - do you understand that ?
   Cabot turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they would do , wild to break from the cloying warmth of the saloon into the cold of the ebbing night.
   He fled through the door and down the steps , running , and the men grunted and followed , pushing Lester to one side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised before his eyes to shut_out the light.
   Purvis and Silas_Pettigrew were the last to leave.
   They mounted_up and rode slowly behind the others at a safe distance.
     In the cold dawn the mist swirled low to the ground , then rose with a gust of sudden wind to leave the valley clear.
   The clouds parted and hard gashes of sunlight swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold light so_that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams over the dazzling snow.
   When they turned in the saddle they could see the men behind them , strung_out on the prairie in a flat black line.
   The wind of their running was cold and wild , the horses were lathered and their manes streamed like stiff black pennants in the wind.
     The mare began to tire and Clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of Gavin 's stallion.
   He looked over his shoulder at the thin dotting of pursuers.
   They neither gained nor fell_back.
   He rode low on the mare 's neck.
   Ahead of him Gavin turned slightly off the trail and pointed for the Gap , no_more_than a mile away.
     Gavin 's face was bloodless with_excitement.
   He did not look_back ; he could feel more_than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fanned_out across the prairie to_the_north.
   He knew who was riding after him - the men he had known all his life , the men who had worked for him , sworn their loyalty to him.
   Now they were riding to kill him.
   And he was fleeing , running - fleeing his death and his life at_the_same_time.
   The land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in : his valley.
   With every leaping stride of the horse beneath him he crossed one more patch of earth that had been his , that he would never see again.
   The Gap looming before him - the place where had confronted Jack_English on_that day so many years ago - was his exit from all that had meaning to him.
     California is too far , he thought.
   He would never reach California.
   He was too old - when he passed up and through the corridor of pines that lined the trail he could see ahead , he was passing from life.
    
    The sentry was not dead.
   He was , in_fact , showing signs of reviving.
   He had been carrying an Enfield rifle and a holstered navy cap-and-ball pistol.
   A bayonet hung in a belt scabbard.
   He was partially uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat.
   Mike stripped these from him and donned them.
   He and Dean tied and gagged the man , using his belt and shirt for the purpose.
   They dragged him inside the building.
     Fiske joined them , unsteady on his feet.
   Julia , seeing the bandage , rushed to him.
    You are hurt !
   she breathed.
      I never felt better in my life  , Fiske blustered.
     He turned to Susan and kissed her on the cheek.
    Thank_you , My dear  , he said.
    You are very brave .
     Mike silenced them.
    We 'll talk later.
   First , we 've got_to get_out of here .
      We 'll grab horses  , Dean said.
    The main bunch is outside , but there are some over there inside the wall .
     Mike debated it , trying to decide whether Fiske was strong enough to ride.
   But it at_least offered him a chance for living.
   He had none here.
   And , for the sake of Julia and Susan , it had to be tried.
     The guerrilla bivouac remained silent.
   Light showed in the orderly room across the parade_ground.
   Someone evidently was on_duty there.
   No_doubt there would be men guarding the horses.
     About a dozen animals were held inside the stockade , as best Mike could make_out in the moonlight.
   Evidently this was a precaution so_that mounts would be available in an emergency.
     He handed the guard 's rifle to Fiske.
    Dean and myself will try to cut out horses to ride  , he said.
    We 'll stampede the rest.
   You stay with the ladies.
   All_of you be ready to ride hell for leather .
     He added ,  If this does n't work_out , the three of you barricade yourself in the house and talk_terms with them .
     He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol.
   Susan halted Dean and kissed him.
   She clung_to him , talking to him , and dabbing at her eyes.
     Mike turned_away.
   He was thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss had n't meant what he had believed it had.
   He felt unutterably weary.
     Dean turned from Susan and took Julia_Fortune in his arms.
   He kissed her also , and with deep tenderness.
   She too began to weep.
   He released her and joined Mike.
    All_right  , he said.
     Mike only said ,  Later .
      Be careful , McLish !
   Susan said fiercely.
      The way you were careful ?
 he snorted.
    Running_around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a man with a rock ?
     He kept going.
   He wanted no_more sentimental scenes with her.
   He might say or do something foolish.
   Something all_of them would regret.
   He might tell her how sorry a spectacle she was making of herself , pretending to be blind_to the way Julia_Fortune had taken Dean 's affections from her.
   And using him , Mike_McLish , as a sop to her pride.
     He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol.
    Stay well back of me  , he said.
    I 'm going_to walk up to the horses , bold as brass , pretending I 'm one of the guerrillas.
   There 's bound_to be someone on_guard , but the hat might fool them long enough for me to get close .
     Holding the pistol concealed , he walked to_the_rear wall of the stockade.
   It was pierced by a wagon gate built of two wings.
   One wing stood open.
   Mike passed_through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses.
   They were tethered , army style , on stable lines.
     A voice spoke near-at-hand.
    Who 's thet ?
     Just me  , Mike said.
    Is that you , Bill ?
     He located his man.
   The guard stood in the shadow of the stockade wall just out_of_reach of the moonlight.
   Mike kept walking and got within arm 's reach before the man became suspicious and straightened from his lax slouch.
     Mike struck with the muzzle of the pistol.
   But the luck that had been running their way left him.
   The guard instinctively parried the blow with his rifle.
   He tried to veer the rifle around to fire into Mike 's body.
     Mike , off balance , managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it exploded.
   The bullet went wide.
   Mike swung the pistol in a savage backlash.
   This time it connected solidly on the man 's temple , felling him.
     The explosion of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the stockade and the deep echoes were still rolling in the hills.
   The startled horses began rearing on their tethers.
     Dean came rushing up.
    Are you hit ?
 he demanded.
      No , but the fat 's in the fire !
   Mike said.
    There 's no chance now of all_of us getting_away.
   You 'll have_to try it alone .
     The sentry 's saddled horse stood picketed nearby , having been kept handy in_case of need.
     Mike took the bayonet from Dean 's hand and slashed the picket_line.
    Up you go !
 he said.
    Ride !
     Dean resisted Mike 's attempt to push him toward the horse.
    Why not you ?
 he protested.
      Dammit !
   Mike said frantically.
    You 're lighter than me.
   It 's our only chance now.
   Try to find these Feds.
   The rest of us can fort_up in the house and hang_on until you get_back.
   You 're the one that 's taking the big chance .
     Dean still hesitated , but Mike lifted him almost bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand.
      No telling how good this horse is  , Mike panted.
    Favor him and save something in_case you hit trouble.
   Watch out for Apaches when it comes daylight.
   Take the pistol.
   You might need it.
   We 'll still have the rifle , and I might be able to round_up some more.
   I 'll stampede the rest of these horses so they can n't chase you .
     Dean leaned from the saddle and gave him a mighty whack on the back.
    McLish  , he said as he kicked the horse into motion ,  I 'd be a mighty sad man if we never met again .
     Then he was on his way at a gallop.
   Mike ran down the line , slashing picket ropes with the bayonet.
   He lifted a screeching war_whoop.
   That touched_off a total stampede.
   He darted inside the stockade and freed the horses there.
   These poured through the gate and joined the flight.
   The animals thundered away into the moonlight , heading for the ridges.
     The guerrillas were swarming from their bivouac at the west_end of the enclosure.
      ' Paches !
   Mike yelled.
    They 're stealin ' the stock !
     He scuttled in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and_then followed the south wall until he was at_the_rear of the two frame buildings.
   He crouched there.
     His shout had been taken_up and repeated.
   The guerrillas were running across the parade_ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the departing horses.
   All were carrying guns they had seized up , but they were half-clad or hardly clad at_all.
     Durkin and Calhoun came running from the post.
   They had pistols in their hands.
   They bawled questions that were not answered in the uproar.
   They followed the others toward_the_east gate.
   Beyond the stockade rifles began to explode as some of the guerrillas fired at shadows that they imagined were Apaches.
     Mike made a dash to_the_rear of the frame buildings.
   He crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner.
   The area was deserted.
   A man was standing in_the_open door of the lighted orderly room a_few yards to Mike 's left , but he , too , suddenly made_up_his_mind and went racing to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade.
     Mike crawled to the door and peered in.
   The orderly room seemed to be deserted.
   A lantern hung from a peg , giving light.
   Ducking inside , he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner.
   A brace of pistols , holstered on belts , hung from a peg , along with ammunition pouches.
   An ammunition case stood open , containing canisters which contained powder cartridges.
     Mike seized a blanket from a pallet in a corner , spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in_which he placed his booty.
     Shouldering the load he peered from the door.
   His looting of the orderly room had taken only a minute or two and the vicinity was still clear of guerrillas.
     He looked at the looming hoods of the supply wagons , struck by a new inspiration.
   He set his bundle down.
   Snatching the lantern from its peg , he shattered its globe with a blow against a post.
   He picked_up the powder canister and ran_out.
   Bursting paper cartridges , he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped the contents of the canister upon it.
     He shouldered the blanket again , backed_off , and tossed the lantern with its open wick beneath the wagon.
   He turned and raced across the parade_ground toward the rock house.
     Powder flame gushed beneath the wagon.
   The stockade was brilliantly lighted and the guerrillas sighted him.
   They realized the truth.
   Bullets began to snap past him.
   One struck the muzzle of one of the rifles that projected from the shoulder pack.
   Its force spun him around , but he recovered and got into stride again.
     A bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety.
   Another struck him heavily in the thigh and he went_down.
     Guerrillas were racing toward him.
   Susan and Julia came from the door and dragged him with them.
   The three of them floundered through the door into_the_interior and fell in a heap.
     Susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door.
   She crouched aside as bullets beat at the portal , chewing into the planks.
   Some tore entirely through the whipsawed post_oak.
   The iron hinges held , but the planks were in danger of being torn from the crossbars.
     mike rolled to Susan , grasped her around the knees , dragging her off her feet.
   He hovered over her to shield her , for spent bullets were thudding against the rear walls.
     He peered from a loophole.
   Guerrillas were only a dozen yards away , charging the house.
   Mike snatched a pistol from the heap of scattered booty and fired.
   He dropped a man with the first bullet.
   At the same moment Wheeler_Fiske fired the rifle Mike had given him and another guerrilla was hit.
   That halted the rush.
   The guerrillas scattered for cover.
     The wagons were burning fiercely.
   The mudwagon had caught_fire also.
   The blaze was spreading to the frame buildings.
     The guerrillas realized they faced a new problem.
    Gawdamighty !
 one screeched.
    There goes our grub an ' ammunition !
      Get a bucket line going !
   Calhoun shouted.
    Hurry!
   Hurry !
     The guerrillas began a frantic search for pails in_which to bring water from the spring.
   But what few containers they found were inadequate.
   Many_of them , in increasing panic , came running with water in their hats in a ludicrous effort.
   Both buildings were in_flames.
   The heat drove the guerrillas back.
   The roof of the command_post began to buckle.
      Drag the wagons to the spring !
   Lew_Durkin yelled.
    Run ' em right into the spring!
   Hustle !
     One of the wagons erupted a massive pillar of flame.
   A sizable supply of powder had been touched_off.
   The wagons and the coach were beyond saving and so were the buildings.
     The glow of the fire reached through the openings in the windows , giving light enough to examine Mike 's wound.
   The bullet had torn through the flesh just above the knee , inflicting an ugly gash that was forming a pool of blood on the floor.
   But it had missed the bone and had passed on through.
   Susan and Julia ripped strips from their clothing and bound the injury.
     Mike tested the leg and found that he was able to hobble around on_it.
    
     So it was n't the earthquake that made him return to his village !
      No.
   Now dammit , I do n't want to go into any_more explanations.
   Here comes Jason.
   Keep this to yourself .
     Reverend_Jason , looking worried , hurried toward us.
    Anything wrong , cap ' n?
   The men seem to think so .
      Dirion found a large war party south of us.
   They 'll probably attack at dawn  , Montero said.
   He brushed past the clergyman and walked into the center of the camp.
   Using his hands as a trumpet he shouted ,  Fort_up!
   Fort_up!
   There 's a large war party on their way !
     For a second , engages , cooks , voyageurs appeared struck dumb.
   Then Little_Billy began shouting orders to round_up the ponies and fill the water buckets and for the cooks to hurry up with the meal.
   They all flew into action.
      That was a terrible thing to do  , I said to Oso.
   The Aricaras treated us like friends.
   And here all_the_time you knew the Sioux would be using our rifles on them!
   God , what a world you people live in .
     Oso gave me an unruffled look.
    Old_Knife 's got the largest war party ever seen on the river  , he said calmly.
    What would you have done in Montero 's moccasins?
   Let Old_Knife come_up and kill you and your people , or would you steer him on someone else ?
   He shook his head.
    Mr. Manuel did that in the war.
   That 's why the_British never got the tribes to fight for the King.
   Mr._Manuel whispered in the ears of the Sioux that the Cheyennes were comin ' to raid ' em for their horses.
   Then he went_on to the Cheyennes and told them that the Sioux was goin ' to move_up.
   He did that with all the Nations.
   Hell , they were fightin ' each other so hard they had no time for anyone else.
   The War_Department wrote Mr._Manuel a letter and said he was a hero.
   I saw that letter.
   He carried it in a_little wallet made of fish skin .
      But that was war  , I said.
    There 's no war on now .
      You 're wrong , Matt.
   In_this country there 's a war on every time the grass turns green.
   First it was the Nations against themselves , then it was them against the whites.
   And it 's goin ' to go_on like this year after year until the white people take_over this land .
     I remember being told it would happen so fast people would think it took_place overnight.
      That 's why this company 's important.
   Once we get_over the mountains others will come_along.
   That 's why the Trust do n't want us to make_it.
   That bastard Chambers!
   - Old_Knife 's not the only chief he 'll get to do his dirty work!
   Before we get_through he 'll have the Blackfeet hankerin ' for our hair and our goods.
   Well , talkin ' ai n't goin ' to help - let 's fort_up !
     As I dug_in behind one of the bales we were using as protection , I grudgingly found myself agreeing with Oso 's logic , especially when I imagined what would have happened to Missy if Old_Knife 's large party of screeching warriors had overrun our company.
     For , unlike the Sioux and the Crows , the Aricaras are not great horsemen , nor are they aggressive like the savage Blackfeet.
   More of an agricultural nation , they have relied_on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the plains.
   Still , I was disgusted with myself for agreeing with Montero 's methods.
     Surprisingly , he had told the others what he had done.
   In the brief moment I had to talk to them before I took my post on the ring of defenses , I indicated I was sickened by the methods men employed to live and trade on the river.
      I think Montero did right  , Amy said firmly.
    Let the savages kill each other What do we care ?
     Reverend_Jason was understandably bitter.
    It was a terrible thing to do.
   Those little children .
     But Oso replied calmly ,  Trouble ai n't easy to dodge out in_this country , rev_'_rend .
     Gray_Eyes attacked our camp just_as the first pink threads stitched together the hills and the sky.
   Our camp was in_the_center of a wide valley.
   Montero had set_up a strong position , using every bale and box we had in_addition to barricades of logs and brush.
   He had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle and had assigned Pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying to keep them steady under_fire.
     The pony herd was the one flaw in our defense ; the Rees undoubtedly would try to cut_down as_many of the animals as possible.
   Wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors.
     The cooks had prepared one of the best meals we 'd had in a long_time , and on Montero 's orders had baked enough bread to last the day.
   Buckets were filled , the herd fed and watered.
   The worst part had been the waiting ; although we did n't expect the attack before dawn , the long cloudy night , filled with the sounds of the industrious insects , seemed endless.
   Coyotes and hunting wolves sounded like signaling Indian scouts , the whinny of a restless pony made one 's skin crawl.
   Oso slept unconcernedly , his rifle cradled in his arms ; I did n't catch_a_wink.
   Every time I closed my eyes , I saw Gray_Eyes rushing at me with a knife.
     It was a relief when they finally came.
     They poured through the opening in the valley , then spread_out in a long line to come at us , brandishing their lances and filling the morning with their spine-chilling scalp cry.
      Oso  , Montero called  I 'll get Gray_Eyes .
      That 'll be a pleasure to see  , the big black murmured as he stared down the barrel of his rifle.
      Hold your fire  , Montero was shouting.
    Wait until my shot.
   I 'll shoot the first man who does n't .
     I could see them in my sights.
   They were about a mile off ; under me the ground quivered slightly.
   At_first they were only feathers and dark indistinguishable faces and bodies , hunched_over their horses ' heads.
   Gradually they emerged as men.
   Gray_Eyes was in_the_lead.
   His face was split by a vermilion streak , his eyes were pools of white ; jagged red and black medicine symbols covered his chest.
   He was naked except for a clout.
   Next to him was a young boy I was sure had sat near me at one of the trading sessions.
   His mouth was open , his neck corded with the strain of his screams.
   I found his chest in my sights.
   It had a red circle.
   The circle came nearer and nearer.
     My God , how long is he going_to wait , I thought.
     Montero 's rifle cracked.
   At_first I thought he had missed.
   Gray_Eyes remained erect.
   The feathered lance was still above his head.
   As he started to slump over , another warrior swung him onto his horse.
     I squeezed the trigger.
   At the last second I dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony.
   I saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its head , bouncing like a rubber ball.
   He started to run but Oso 's shot caught him on the wing.
   He jerked once in the grass and lay still.
      If you 're goin ' to kill ' em - kill ' em !
   Oso growled.
     What else he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire on_all_sides.
   The Aricaras broke under the devastating fire , wheeled and retreated.
      Lead_up!
   Lead_up!
   They 'll be back !
   Montero was shouting.
     Far up the valley I could see the Rees circling and reorganizing.
   Out in_front of our walls the grass was covered with dead and dying men , war shields , lances , blankets and wounded and dead horses.
   The morning air was filled with the sweetish odor of new-spilled blood , the acrid stench of frightened horses , and the bitterness of burned powder.
   A horse screamed as it twisted from side to side in a frenzy.
   A rifle cracked ; the square head fell_over.
   One of the warriors suddenly leaped to his feet and began running across the valley to the trees that lined the small creek.
   His legs pumped furiously , his long black hair streamed out behind him.
   There was a ragged volley.
   He was dead before he hit the ground.
      For Christ 's sake , do n't waste your powder on one of ' em !
   Montero shouted furiously.
    Wait for the charge!
   The charge , I tell you !
     The sharp cries at the end of the valley were faint.
   They grew louder as the Indians charged again.
   I could see their faces glistening with sweat and bear_grease , their mouths open , shouting their spine-chilling cries.
      Gray_Eyes is back  , Montero said.
     The war captain had been badly wounded and was fighting to hold his seat.
   I could see the blood running down his chest.
   He was riding between two warriors , who held him erect when he started to slump.
     I forgot to aim.
   In my sights I watched him looming bigger and bigger.
   Montero 's shot had caught him high in the chest ; there was no_doubt he was dying.
   Again we waited for Montero.
   This time he delayed so_long that some of the engages shouted frantically , but they held their fire.
   The horses were only several lengths away when he fired.
   The bullet flung Gray_Eyes from his horse.
   Our rolling volley swept most_of the other riders from their mounts.
   But a_few reached our wall.
   I heard the whir of an ax and a Canadian 's face burst apart in a bloody spray.
   I saw Little_Billy rise and fire almost point blank and an Indian 's face became shattered flesh and bone.
   A second leaped from his horse to the top of the bale , firing four arrows in such rapid succession it did n't seem possible they were in flight.
   Men screamed.
   Oso reached up , jerked the buck from the bale and snapped his neck.
   Other Indians were running at the ponies , shrilling and waving blankets.
   Reverend_Jason got one , the Canadians the others.
   I saw the clergyman kneel for a moment by the twitching body of the man he had shot , then run back to his position.
     The ponies were almost uncontrollable.
   The pall of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the Aricaras charged again.
   This time more of them hurdled the barrier.
   A small Indian dived at Montero , who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle_butt.
   It sounded like a man kicking a melon.
   Above me a dark rider was whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales.
     Although my shot killed his horse , he rolled off the bale on top of me.
   I could smell woodsmoke , grease , and oil.
   His eyes were dark , fluid , fearful , and he gave a sigh as my knife went_in.
   Coming over the wall he had seemed like a hideous devil.
   Now under me I could see him for what he really was , a boy dressed_up in streaks of paint.
     The Aricaras made one last desperate charge.
   It was pitiful to see the thin ranks of warriors , old and young , wheeling and twisting their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding from their saddles by the relentless slam , slam of the cruelly efficient Hawkinses.
   Others , badly wounded , gripped hands in manes , knees in bellies , held_on as long as possible and_then , weak from ghastly wounds , slipped sideways , slowly , almost thoughtfully , to be broken under the slashing hoofs.
   Some gracefully soared from the backs of their wounded , screaming mounts to make one last defiant charge before the lead split their hearts or tore their guts.
     None of them reached our walls again.
   The few survivors grudgingly turned_away.
   In the distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song.
    
    Such was my state_of_mind that I did not question the possibility of_this ; under_the_circumstances I was only_too willing to confess all.
   I was nearly thirty at_the_time.
     I went_to the hall in the afternoons only , on these preliminary matters.
   It was dark and , I sensed , very large ; only the counter at one end was lighted by a long fluorescent tube suspended directly above it.
   Sometimes I was aware_of people moving about in the darkness.
   I would turn away from my writing in the hope of getting a good look at them but I never quite succeeded.
   A glimpse of three of four vague figures , at_the_most.
   Drifting here_and_there.
   Squatting , as if waiting.
   The pulsing glow of a cigarette.
   Since they could see me but I not them , their presence in the hall disturbed me.
   The clerk paid them no attention.
   This impressed me , until I realized how limited was his sphere_of_influence.
   His job simply consisted_in registering new men.
   When the phone rang he answered it.
   His authority extended_to the far edge of the counter , no further.
   None of the men hanging_around the hall bothered to speak to him.
   Baldness was attacking his pate.
   He spoke_to me in a gruff voice , an affectation which quite belied his personality.
   He wore his white shirt open at the neck , revealing a_bit of scrawny pale chest underneath.
   It was obvious that he wished himself different from the sort_of person he thought he was.
   But it was not easy for him and he often slipped.
   When one of the men in the hall behind us spat on the floor and scraped his boot over the gob of spittle I noticed how the clerk winced.
   I felt certain he was really a spineless little man.
   His hat ( the cause of his baldness?
 )   hung on a hook on the wall , and underneath it I could see his tie , knotted , ready_to be slipped over his head , a black badge of frayed respectability that ought never to have_left his neck.
   The morning 's tabloids were on the counter , and a stack of dog-eared men 's magazines.
   On a shelf in the office behind the counter was a small radio dialed permanently on a station which broadcast only vulgar commercials and cheap popular_music.
   Everything about the clerk was trivial.
   Once , pressing him , I learned that his job was only part-time , in the afternoons when nothing went_on in the hall.
   Noticing my disappointment he attempted to salvage what scraps and shreds of authority he felt might still be clinging_to his person.
   With distaste I saw him assume a pompous air.
   When he saw me coming he turned his radio off.
   He made a show of rearranging my forms on the shelf.
   He would pick_up the ringing phone with studied negligence , then bark into it with gruff importance.
   What limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon me.
   In the mornings , I was informed , fluorescent tubes , similar to the one above the counter , illuminated the entire hall.
   They , and the two large fans which I could dimly see as daylight filtered through their vents , down at the far end of the hall , could be turned_on by a master switch situated inside the office.
   He pointed_out the switch to me and for a moment I foolishly believed that he would let deed follow words.
   I was shown , instead , a batch of white tickets of the sort handed_out , he told me , every morning.
   Now , here was something of obvious importance to me , yet when I reached for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand.
   He could n't afford to have anyone mess_around with them , he said.
   Each of those tickets was of great value to its rightful recipient.
   I withdrew my hand.
   Later I would remember what this pompous little man had told me about the worth of a ticket.
     Having nothing else to do except wait for my forms to be processed , I gave myself over to speculations concerning the hall itself.
   When suitably lighted , what would it look_like?
   The presence of the two exhaust_fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air.
   One afternoon , upon receiving permission and the necessary instructions from the clerk , I had visited the toilet adjoining the hall.
   By counting the number of stalls and urinals I attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold at_one_time.
   For although I had crossed a corner of the hall on my way to the toilet I still could not tell for_sure how far to_the_rear the darkness extended.
   I could observe the two fans down at the end , but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long as I had no measure of comparison.
   I had for_some_time been hoping , in_vain , for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan vents and myself.
   I knew that three or four of them were almost always present in the hall , but what they were doing , and exactly where , I could not tell.
   It was , I felt , possible that they were men who , having received no tickets for that day , had remained in the hall , to sleep perhaps , in the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light.
   This light did not penetrate very far back into the hall , and my eyes were hindered rather_than aided by the dim daylight entering through the fan vents when I tried to pick_out whatever might be lying , or squatting , on the floor below.
   Also the clerk appeared to disapprove of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder.
   No sooner would I turn my head away from the counter before he would address me , at_times quite sharply , in_order_to bring_back my attention.
   And I had hardly finished my business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion when the lights in_that place , like the hall lights controlled from the switch in the office , flicked off_and_on impatiently.
   This sort_of petty vigilance annoyed me.
   I felt certain it was self-appointed.
   It sprang from a type of mentality I 'd encountered often enough but certainly had not expected to find here.
   I decided to see no_more of the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed.
     I felt strongly attached to the hall , however , and hardly_a day passed when I did not go to look at it from a distance.
   I lived in a state of suspense because of_it.
   I could not cling to my past nor did I wish to.
   I had signed it off on the forms.
   My future lay solely with the hall , yet what did I know about the hall at this point?
   Although I had been inside it I had not_yet seen it functioning.
   I wished to prepare myself but did not even know what sort_of clothes I ought_to be wearing.
   I did not despair , however ; far from_it!
   I was constantly searching for clues around the neighborhood of the hall.
   Though only a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town , its character was wholly foreign to me.
   Large warehouses flanked the street on_which the hall fronted.
   The river was only a_few blocks away but an unbroken line of piers prevented me from seeing it.
   Sometimes I noticed the tops of ships ' masts and funnels reaching above the pier roofs.
   The sounds issuing from beyond - winches whirring , men shouting - indicated great activity and excited me.
   The hall , on_the_other_hand , appeared lifeless and deserted on these long waterfront afternoons.
   It resembled nothing I 'd ever seen before.
   Its front was windowless , but irregularities in the masonry might be an indication that windows , now blinded , had once looked_out upon the street.
   I kept circling the block hoping to see , from the street behind it , the rear of the hall.
   But it was not a tall structure and other buildings concealed it.
   For weeks I wandered about this neighborhood of warehouses and garages , truck terminals and taxi repair_shops , gasoline_pumps and longshoremen 's lunch counters , yet never did I cease to feel myself a stranger there.
     I returned to the hall , despite my dislike for the clerk.
   As I had expected , he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application.
   Meanwhile spring had passed well into summer.
   At_last , when I put it to him directly , the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my case was unusual.
   When I asked him what , if anything , I could do about it , he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall.
   I could consult this personage on any weekday morning , though not before ten o ' clock.
   The clerk impressed this upon me : that I should not arrive in the hall before ten o ' clock.
   When I went for my interview with the director I saw why.
   Although it was dark as_usual I could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people.
   Cigarette_butts littered the floor.
   The big fans were going , drawing from the large room the remnants of stale smoke which drifted about in pale strata underneath the ceiling.
   I had felt the draft they were making while mounting the stairs.
   The staircase itself seemed still to be echoing the heavy footfalls of many men.
   I stopped by the counter.
   No one was behind it , but in the rear wall of the office I noticed , for_the_first_time , a door which had been left partially open.
   Past it I could see part of a desk , a flag in a corner , a rug on the floor.
   The director 's office.
   I rapped my knuckles on the counter.
   The director came to the door.
   I was at_once disappointed , although just what I had expected him to look_like I could not have explained.
   He was a man in his late forties , with graying hair , of medium height ; he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit , brown silk tie and green-tinted soft collar.
   He wore perforated , white-topped shoes ; they somehow made me expect to see him launch into a vaudeville tapdance routine any moment.
   But he came toward me sedately enough , showed me around the counter , offered me a seat inside his office , then walked to a file_cabinet and got_out my application.
   I had the impression that he had read my forms , perhaps several_times.
   He did not look at them now.
   As he lowered himself on the chair behind his desk I wondered what this dapper , slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the workings of the hall.
   He spoke , in a voice as immaculate as his appearance.
   Why had I registered?
   Begging my pardon , he must express his astonishment over seeing a person of my background applying at the hall.
   He had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there ; indeed , my scholastic qualifications were such_that he , a college graduate himself , must envy me them.
   Was I sure , he asked , that I knew what I was applying for?
   What sort_of men I would come into contact with , at the hall?
   These questions did not surprise me ; I felt certain that the director , like the afternoon clerk , seldom moved beyond the counter , that the hall , to them , was a jungle , a dark and unwelcome place.
   Though I doubted that he would understand me , I told the director my motives for applying.
   I had always , I said , hankered after working hard with my hands.
   This desire , I went_on , growing voluble as my conviction was aroused , had mounted at such a rate recently that I now found its realization necessary not_only to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing.
   To this effect I had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence.
    
    The flat , hard cap was small , but he thrust it to_the_back of his head.
      Tie him up .
      Hell with_it .
     Before they could guess his intention Rankin stepped forward and swung the guard 's own gun against the uncovered head , hard.
   The man went_over without sound , falling to the bare floor.
     Barton said harshly ,  Why did you do that ?
     Rankin sneered at him.
    What did you want me to do , kiss him?
   He dumped me in solitary twice .
     Barton caught the lighter man 's shoulder and swung him around.
      Let 's get one thing straight , you and me.
   The only reason we brought you was to get Miller out.
   If you ever try anything without my orders I 'll kill you .
     Fred_Rankin looked at him.
   It seemed to Barton that the green eyes mocked him , the thin-lipped smile held insolence , but he had no time to waste now.
      Come_on.
   Let 's move .
     They filed_out through the guard-room door , into the paved square.
   There were three other men within this prison whom Barton would have liked to liberate , but they were in other cell blocks.
   There was no chance.
   They moved slowly , toward the main gate , following the wall.
   There was no moon.
   They had chosen this_night purposely.
   They reached the guard house without alerting the men on the walls above , and Powers slipped through the door.
     Two men were on_duty inside , playing pinochle , relaxed.
   They looked up in surprise as Powers came_in.
      What are you doing out of the block ?
      It 's Curtiss  , he said , naming the man Rankin had hit.
    I 've got_to have help .
     They stared at him.
   The sergeant in charge climbed to his feet.
      What 's wrong with him ?
      He 's having some kind_of a fit .
     The sergeant turned to the door.
   As he passed_through it Barton shoved his gun against the man 's side.
      One sound and you 're dead .
     The sergeant froze.
   Powers had not followed.
   Powers was covering the remaining guard.
   The man half reached for the cord of the alarm_bell.
   Powers knocked his arm aside.
   Deliberately , with none of Rankin 's viciousness , he laid the barrel of his gun alongside the guard 's head.
     They were free.
   Even Barton could not_quite believe it.
   It had gone without a hitch.
   They slid through the wicket in the big gate , ghosted across the dark ground.
   Five minutes later they reached the horses.
   Barton was relieved to see that Carl_Dill and Emmett_Foster had brought extra mounts.
   He had been worried that with Miller and Rankin added to the escape party they would be short.
     No one hurried.
   They walked the horses , heading along the river , Barton and Emmett_Foster in_the_lead , seven men riding quietly through the night.
     The only thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison_guards , three the striped suits of convicts.
     Five miles.
     In a small grove against the river they halted , turning deep into the protection of the trees.
   Foster had brought extra clothing also.
   A good man , Emmett.
   He had been one of the original Night_Riders , one who had escaped the trial.
   It was to him that Barton had sent Carl_Dill on Dill 's release from the prison.
     Clyde_Miller was crying softly to himself , shedding his striped suit and fumbling into the nondescript butternut pants , the worn brown shirt.
   Kid_Boyd was unusually silent , Rankin watchful , a_few paces apart.
   Barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to Powers.
      I won n't even try to thank you .
     The ex-prison guard was embarrassed.
   He said in a studied voice ,  I did n't do it for you.
   I did it for the valley.
   You 're the only man the Night_Riders will follow.
   We 've been starving and I do n't like to starve .
     Barton turned_away , his eyes falling upon Rankin beside his horse.
      Good_luck .
     The murderer lifted his head.
    Meaning you want me to ride out ?
      You are n't one of us.
   There 's nothing for you here .
      I got no place to go .
     Barton hesitated.
   He did not trust Rankin , his violent temper , his killer instinct.
   But ten years in prison had taught him realities.
   They were in a fight , outweighed in both numbers and money.
   It was all_right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses , to call them Night_Riders , to set_out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure.
   But if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals , men who knew how to use a gun against men , who would match the killers on the other side.
      Your choice  , he said briefly , and turned_to Kid_Boyd.
    Bury those uniforms so they won n't be found .
     Then Barton touched Carl_Dill 's arm and moved off , up the river bank.
   He wanted a careful , uninterrupted report from Dill on the conditions in the valley.
     They squatted on their heels in the deep mud and Dill found a cigar in his breast_pocket , passing it over silently.
   He too knew the agony of going for weeks , sometimes months without the solace of tobacco.
     Mitchell_Barton drew_in the fragrance deeply , letting the smoke lie warm and soothing in his throat for a moment before he exhaled.
     Through the gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly.
   For his first five years in prison , they had shared a cell.
     Carl_Dill was neither a rancher nor a valley man.
   He had been the auditor for the mining syndicate , and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the syndicate 's money.
   He had done time for the theft.
     The one thing they had in_common was their hatred.
   Both hated Donald_Kruger.
   It had drawn them together , and since his release from prison Dill had worked tirelessly to effect this_night 's escape.
     He said now ,  I 've got the perfect headquarters set_up.
   The old Haskell mine .
     Mitch_Barton knew the place.
   Twenty years before a group of Easterners had bought_out the Haskell claims in the rocky hills south of Grass_Valley.
   They had spent a_million dollars , carving in a road , putting_up buildings , drilling their haulage tunnel.
   Then the vein had petered_out and the whole project had been abandoned.
      The road 's washed badly  , said Dill ,  but there 's a trail you can get_over with a horse.
   A company of cavalry could n't come_in there if two men were guarding that trail .
     Barton nodded.
    How do the valley people feel ?
      As mad as ever.
   But Kruger 's men keep them off balance , and they do n't trust me.
   I 'm an outsider.
   When they learn you 're in the hills though , they 'll rally , do n't worry about that .
     Barton waited for a long moment , then asked the question which lay always uppermost in his mind.
      My boy.
   Did you find him ?
     Dill was silent as if he hated to answer , and Barton had a cold , sick feeling of apprehension.
      He 's in Morgan 's Ferry .
     Barton half straightened in surprise.
      What 's he doing there ?
     Again Dill hesitated.
    Dealing faro .
      Dealing faro?
   How_come ?
      Your sister-in-law has the faro bank in Cap_Ayres ' saloon .
     Barton cursed under his breath.
   After another long pause he asked ,  How many people know who they are ?
      Everyone.
   Your cousin Finley saw to that.
   He 's quite a rat , you know.
   He sold_out to Kruger 's men.
   He 's informed them of everything you 've ever written him.
   He wants your ranch .
     Barton stood_up.
   He said tensely ,  All_right.
   Let 's go get the boy .
     Dill had come_up also.
    I was afraid of_this.
   I almost did n't tell you .
      If you had n't I 'd have killed you .
     Dill 's voice tightened.
    But you can n't ride into the Ferry.
   That 's what they 'll expect you to do.
   They 'll be there waiting for you.
   I understand how you feel about the child .
      The hell you do .
   Barton 's voice was rougher than Dill had ever heard it.
    I never saw him.
   My wife died in childbirth after I was sent_away.
      I can n't leave him there.
   Donald_Kruger would like nothing better than to hold him as hostage , and I would n't entrust a snake to his tender care.
   I 've got_to get the boy.
   Let 's ride .
     Barton 's men cut the telegraph_wires in half_a_dozen places , carrying_away whole sections to make repairs more difficult.
   It was over an hour before their escape was discovered , but still the news that Barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state.
     It reached Donald_Kruger in his massive home in Burlingame.
   It reached the mines at North San_Juan and Bloomfield.
   It brought men out_of_bed and sent them into hurried conferences.
     For everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder_keg , and Mitchell_Barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence.
     Creighton_Hague sat in his office above the Ione pit.
   The office was of logs , four rooms , each heated by an iron stove.
   The building was dwarfed by the scene outside.
   There a dozen giant monitors played their seventy-five-foot jets of water against the huge seam of tertiary gravel which was the mountainside.
     The gravel was the bed of an ancient river , buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of earth.
   It was partially cemented by ages and pressure , yet it crumpled before the onslaught of the powerful streams , the force of a_thousand fire_hoses , and with the gold it held washed_down through the long sluices.
   A_million dollars ' of gold a month.
   A_million tons of rock and soil and brush.
     The monitors ran twenty-four_hours each_day.
   Their roar , like the swelling volume of a_hundred tornadoes could be heard for miles.
   Hague , like all who worked near the_pits , was partly deafened from the constant assault against his eardrums.
     He was a big man , wearing a neat flannel shirt against the cold foothill air.
   Fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt.
   Ten years older than Mitch_Barton , he had clawed his way up from mucker in the_pits to manager of the operation.
     He was proud_of his accomplishments , proud_of his job , proud that Donald_Kruger and his associates trusted him.
   He lived and breathed for the mining_company.
     No man could have reached his spot nor held it without being ruthless , and Hague had made a virtue of ruthlessness all_of his life.
     There came a ghost of noise at the office door and Hague swung to see Kodyke in the entrance from the outer room.
   Hague had never accustomed himself to Kodyke.
   The man was tall , thin , with a narrow face and a too-large nose.
   The eyes always held Hague , eyes of a dead man , lidless as a lizard 's , with the fixed intensity of a cobra.
   Even Hague was repelled by the machinelike deadliness that was Kodyke.
     He knew nothing about the man 's history.
   Kodyke had appeared at the mine one_day bearing a letter from Kruger.
   Kodyke was to head the dread company police.
   He ran the change rooms.
   He threw_out the hi-graders.
   He supervised the cleanups and handled the shipments of raw gold which each_week went_out to San_Francisco.
     Hague squeezed down his uneasy dislike.
   He pulled open the top drawer of his desk and drew out a tintype.
      This is Mitchell_Barton.
   He broke_out of Folsom last night.
   Apparently he bribed one of the guards.
   We want him back there or we want him dead .
     Kodyke took the picture in a lean hand , studying it thoughtfully.
      Dangerous ?
      Dangerous , yes.
   You know how the ranchers in the valley are.
   They blame us for all their troubles.
   Ten years ago they blew_up some of our ditches.
   It cost us a_hundred_thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them.
   We do n't want Barton 's Night_Riders loose again .
     The gunman nodded , slipping the picture into his breast_pocket , saying nothing.
     Normally Hague wasted no words , but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although he knew Kodyke was aware_of all he said.
    
    If she sensed any unusual preoccupation on the part of her mother , she did not comment upon it.
     After they had finished eating , Melissa took Sprite the kitten under her arm -  so_that Auntie_Grace can teach it about the whistle  - and climbed into the station_wagon beside her mother.
   She had offered to walk , but Pamela knew she would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally confided her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called  Auntie .
     When they reached their neighbor 's house , Pamela said a_few polite words to Grace and kissed Melissa lightly on the forehead , the impulse prompted by a stray thought - of the type to_which she was frequently subject these days - that they might never see one another again.
   Then she turned the station_wagon around and headed it back down the hill , with the village as her ostensible destination.
     As she drove , she thought_about her plan.
   It was really quite simple.
   So simple , in_fact , that it might even work - although Pamela , now , in her new frame_of_mind , was careful not to pretend too_much assurance.
   That mistake , she thought , had cost her dearly these past few days , and she wanted to avoid falling into any_more of the traps that the mountain might set for her.
   She must be cautious so as not to alert the scheming forest.
     When the station_wagon drew abreast_of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the Culver house , Pamela turned the wheel , guiding the car to its familiar parking spot close_to the house , and stopped.
   All_of her movements were careful and methodical , partaking of the stealth of a criminal who has plotted his felony for months in_advance and knows exactly which step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime.
   She locked the ignition , removed the keys , stepped out of the car and went_into the house.
   Here , she dropped the keys on a small table beside the door and went upstairs to her bedroom.
     On her bureau lay a small , brass ornament of simple design and faded engraving - an object which , Pamela believed now , had been the property of her great-grandfather , Major_Hiram_Munroe_Culver.
   He had belonged_to this land and , perhaps , had desecrated it - and this was the only material symbol that remained of him.
   If she , Pamela , were being held responsible_for his crimes , then hers must be the final act of expiation.
   She would return this symbol to the mountain , as one pours seed back into the soil every Spring & & & or as ancient fertility cults demand annual human sacrifice.
     Slowly and thoughtfully , she slipped the ornament into the pocket of her slacks , moved down_the_stairs and out of the house.
   There was only one place where the mountain might receive her - that unnamed , unnameable pool harbored in its secret bosom.
   Atonement , if atonement were possible , could only be made at that sacred , sacrificial basin.
   It was there that she would have_to enact her renunciation , beg forgiveness.
     Perhaps it was insane , Pamela thought.
   Perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream.
   But she was caught in it , and she faced the terrible possibility that , if it were a dream , it was one from which she might never awaken.
     Facing the forest now , she who had not dared to enter it before , walked between two trees at_random and headed in_what she believed was the direction of the pool.
   She remembered little of her previous journey there with Grace , and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission would enable her to accomplish it.
     The forest was open and freely welcoming , extending an enchanted hand.
   The ground was covered with soft pine needles and the slope was gentle.
   Birds chirped and chattered in the trees and the sun , all dewy-eyed and soft , caressed her shoulders warmly from_time_to_time.
   It was not , thought Pamela , such an evil place after_all.
   No wonder Melissa responded so completely to its beckoning.
     Perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed.
   Was it not possible , after_all , that the forest was in league with her and her child , that its sympathy lay with the Culvers , that she had erred in failing to understand this?
     Pamela felt calm and peaceful as she walked along.
   The slight flutter that had disturbed the motion of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now , and even the dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not reawaken her fear.
   She regarded them as signs that she was nearing the glen she sought , and she was glad to at_last be doing something positive in her unenunciated , undefined struggle with the mountain and its darkling inhabitants.
     Having persisted too long in deliberate ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her , Pamela was relieved now to admit their potency and to be taking definite steps toward grappling with them.
   A_few days ago , she would have thought such an expedition as this utterly ridiculous ; today , on_the_contrary , it seemed utterly reasonable.
     She did not pause to consider what she would do if her plan should fail ; she directed all_of her mental and physical energy toward achieving this one goal.
   If , as she walked , her steps fumbled from_time_to_time , she chose to ignore that omen.
   If the slope grew steeper and the groves more dim , she tried not to heed.
   Success depended_upon maintaining her equanimity ; she must be poised and proud and unafraid in_order_to prove to the mountain that she was in_earnest.
     The forest took_on an impersonal aspect.
   It did not care what sort_of person prowled its woods , plucked at its bark or stripped the berries from its bushes.
   Unconcerned , indifferent , unmotivated , the forest was simply there - fighting man 's depredations with more abundant growth and man 's follies with its own musical evening laughter.
   Red_man or white_man , pacifist or killer , the forest would accept them all - knowing that it could thrive equally well on slaughter and beneficence ; knowing that its ageless mass would always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man.
     Pamela shook her head.
   She must_not think_about time.
   That was another one of those traps.
     In her grim pursuit of tranquillity , Pamela focused her thoughts on her husband.
   If , when this was all_over , she found the words to tell him about it , she wondered if he would ever understand.
   How could he comprehend her need when he himself was innocent?
   Indian ghosts would not impinge upon his nights , nor would his days be haunted by the dimly-outlined , ill-conceived figure of her benighted ancestor.
   His bright , daylight mind would whistle away such images ; they would not dare to face his scoffing.
     Pamela was glad Jim was nowhere near.
   His presence would have interfered with her duty.
     The mountainside grew steeper and she slipped once or twice on the smooth pine needles.
   The trees huddled more closely together , their limbs and leaves intertwined in a coarse curtain against the sun.
   Bushes and vines abetted the rocks in forming thorny detours for the struggling stranger , and without the direct light of the sun to act_as compass , Pamela could no_longer be positive of her direction.
     Nevertheless , she continued to move upward.
   She was sure she would reach the pool by climbing , and she clung to that belief despite the increasing number of obstacles.
   The forest had become an alien world where she strove , alone , unprotected , unguided , to deal with whatever hindrances were offered.
   It was a bold , dark castle of pine boughs that stood like a medieval fortress , eclipsing the sun and human time.
   At one_and_the_same time , she was within it but still searching for the drawbridge that would give her entry.
     Silence came into the forest - a solid being that clapped its hand over the murmuring mouths of the_birds and the whispered comfort of the trees.
   Silence walked at Pamela 's side , its presence numbingly close , yet too far for her to hear.
   Silence stood in front of her , waiting , and in back of her , blocking her retreat.
     She stumbled over the root of a tree that protruded maliciously above the earth.
   In_spite_of her attempt to preserve her balance , she fell , bruising her arm on a naked stone.
   For a moment , she could not catch her breath and_then , her breath returning in_short , frightened spasms , she lifted herself to her feet laboriously.
   She started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her clothes.
   Her arm bled slightly , and the offended skin cried_out in pain.
     She looked_around.
   She was bewildered.
   She seemed to have come such a long distance - too far for her destination which had wilfully been swallowed_up in the greedy gloom of the trees.
   She stood quite still , trying to focus upon a direction in_which to turn , a path to follow , a clue to guide her.
     She was standing in a thick grove.
   The trees were crowded so closely together that their branches overlapped , virtually shutting_out the sun completely.
   The earth smelled moist and pungent as it might in a cave deprived_of the cleansing effect of the sun 's rays.
   She had the feeling that , under the mouldering leaves , there would be the bodies of dead_animals , quietly decaying and giving their soil back to the mountain.
     The thought made Pamela shudder.
   A terrible chill swept through the grove.
   Not a breeze exactly , but a pocket of icy air that settled with a loathsome familiarity upon the deep confines of the grove , catching Pamela in a leering embrace.
   There was a peculiar density about it , a thick substance that could be sensed but never identified , never actually perceived.
     Where before had she felt or dreamt or imagined such a scene?
   She already knew this unwholesome , chilling atmosphere that was somehow grotesquely alive.
   It enclosed her clammy hands and twined around her ankles.
   It crept into the open neck of her blouse and slid down her body , seeping into her flesh through all the quivering pores of her skin.
   It crawled across her breasts , suffocating the life in her nipples.
   It circled her thighs , exploring with its icy tentacles.
   It entered her body with the ghastly intimacy of an incubus , and its particles , spreading , creeping , crawling , joined themselves into steel_bands that constricted her knees so tightly that they ached ; stifled her lungs so_that her breath came in harsh gasps ; clutched her throat and sucked_up the moisture in her mouth so_that her tongue was dry and hard and stuck_to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were clenched together in the rigid fixture of her jaws.
     She had to get_away from here before_this demoniac possession swallowed_up the liquid of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain , depriving her of reason and sight.
   But she did not know which way to go.
   The shadows of the trees engulfed her , foreclosing every possible exit from the grove.
   She had been snared here by a vile sensuality that writhed around her throat in ever-tightening circles.
     She could not scream , for even if a sound could take_shape within her parched mouth , who would hear , who would listen?
     Does the mountain listen?
     Pamela groped blindly.
   She had to escape.
   She had to move in some direction - any direction that would take her away from this evil place.
     She thrust forward through the shadows and the trees that resisted her and tried to fling her back.
   Her own body protested , aching painfully where the blood in her veins had congealed , where cold demon wisps still clung and caressed.
     Every movement she made seemed unnecessarily noisy.
   Twigs cracked loudly under her feet ; bushes swished and scratched at her slacks ; tree_branches snapped as she pushed them ruthlessly away from her.
    
    People came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it.
   The room filled with smoke , and Maggie 's head throbbed with_excitement and fatigue , but Stuart had such a happy , earnest look of proud possession on his face that Maggie could n't bear to do anything to quench it.
     Little_Anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery.
   In two months she became a fat highly social baby , with a fuzz of flaxen hair all_over her head.
   She stopped flying into rages and started digesting her food ; she developed a peaches and cream complexion and a sunny disposition , and she asked for nothing more of life than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going_on around her.
     She was so heavy that Maggie 's arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her.
   Maggie could n't seem to get her strength back or catch_up_with herself with all she had to do : there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back ; there was the daily round of household chores in_which Maggie insisted on participating.
   Worry had a great_deal to do with_it ; Stuart had been laid_off at the produce company and had to go_back to sitting in his father 's office , taking what salary his father could hand_out to him.
   Mr._Clifton would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with his wife 's people without contributing to his and his family 's upkeep , and besides that there were the things that had to be bought for the baby , milk and orange_juice and vitamins and soap , just plain soap.
   Maggie and Stuart pored over figures every_night , trying to find how they could squeeze_out a_few pennies more.
     In desperation Maggie consulted Eugenia one afternoon :    Do you think you could find me something I could do here at_home to make some money , so I could still watch the baby and do the rest of the things ?
      It seems to me you have enough to do as_it_is  , Eugenia said.
   She had been watching Maggie go from the washing_machine to the baby to the stove and back again.
      I have plenty of odd moments when I could be doing something  , Maggie said.
    It would make me feel a_lot better , but the Woman 's Exchange is n't taking baked_goods any_more and I can n't leave the baby with Grandma because she is n't strong enough and the baby 's too young to be put in a nursery .
      I should think so  , Eugenia said.
    For_one_thing you can stop keeping that child in starched dresses and changed from the skin out nineteen times a day .
      She 's so beautiful , and I do like to keep her looking nice .
   Maggie said.
   She picked_up the baby and nuzzled her fat warm little neck.
      She 'll be just_as beautiful in something that does n't have to be ironed  , Eugenia said.
    Evadna_Mae_Evans said she did n't put a thing on her child but a flannel wrapper until it was nine months old .
      Evadna_Mae_Evans got all her baby clothes from Best 's Liliputian_Bazaar in New_York , and I 'm sick and tired_of hearing about Evadna_Mae_Evans .
      Well now , Maggie , you do n't have to snap at me  , Eugenia said.
    I 'm just thinking_of a way for you to be sensible .
      I 'm sorry.
   I do seem to snap at everybody these days , but I would like to think_of a way to make a_little extra money .
      Well , let 's see.
   Let 's make a list of your assets .
     Maggie started laughing , and she laughed so hard she could n't stop , and she kept_on laughing while she lugged the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still shining.
   When she came_back Eugenia was sitting at the kitchen_table with a pencil and envelope jotting_down words and figures.
      I have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working mothers  , Eugenia said.
    We could put_up cribs on the second floor sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a playroom where it 's nice and sunny , but of_course it would entail quite a_bit of running up and down stairs and Chris said you were to be careful about that .
      What else ?
      You might set_up a dress_shop in the living_room .
      Every woman in the block has tried that .
      What about a tea_room , then?
   You could set_up tables in the front_room and serve salads and your baked beans and brown_bread and Grandma could dress like a gypsy and tell fortunes .
      It 's too elaborate.
   And Grandma is n't strong enough to take_on something like that , and to tell you the truth neither am I .
     Eugenia sighed.
   She said ,  Well , those are the really interesting things , but if you do n't like any of those I can turn_over some of my extra typing jobs to you , if you think you can type well enough .
      Oh , I 'm sure I could do that  , Maggie said.
    But it really would n't be fair , taking your jobs away from you .
      Do n't worry , I can get plenty more  , Eugenia said , wondering where in the world she could.
   Maggie was looking much happier already , clearing a space on the table and chattering about how she could put_up a typewriter right_there , and be brushing_up on her typing so Eugenia would n't be ashamed of_it.
    And_then whenever I have a minute I can be working_at it , and keep_an_eye_on the baby and the stove at_the_same_time.
   And I can go_back to my contests and be thinking while I 'm doing the washing .
      What are you going_to do with your feet so you do n't waste anything ?
     Maggie laughed.
   She said ,  Oh Eugenia , I wish & & & .
      What ?
      I wish I had three wishes  , Maggie said.
    All_of them for you .
     It grew bitterly cold toward the end of November , contributing to the miseries of countless numbers of people.
   The temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during the days.
   The cold settled like a tangible pall over the Mile_High_City , locking it in an icy grip that harshened its outlines and altered its physical appearance ; it had a look of grim stark realism , resembling other cities whose habitual climate was cold , instead of the sprawling bumptious open-handed greedy Western city basking in eternal sunshine at the foot of mountains stored with endless riches and resources.
     The jobless huddled in the streets outside of employment offices , outside newspaper buildings , in parks , in relief lines , outside government agencies.
   There were n't facilities to take_care of them ; there never had been a need felt for such facilities.
   That kind_of poverty was regarded_as the exclusive property of the East , which created depressions with their stock_markets and their congested populations and their greedy centralization of industries , protected by discriminatory freight_rates.
   The East was popularly supposed to have got the country into war and into depression , dragging the west along ; and now the East was creating government agencies for which the West doubtless would have to pay.
     The government_offices were being opened but they were n't being opened fast enough and meanwhile the cold penetrated everything.
   Shivering , people talked and argued ; all this government spending would have to be paid for somehow , but on_the_other_hand desperate circumstances called_for desperate remedies and something had to be done.
     Something had to be done ; it was the theme_song of millions of American people , their personal problems no less urgent than those of the government.
   Something had to be done.
   The Abernathys said it to each other a dozen times a day.
     Something had to be done about the furnace , the fuel bills , the washing_machine , the doctor and dentist bills , about making money stretch for food , for the mortgage , for taxes , for shoes , for half_soles , for overshoes , for clothes , for the new leaks in the roof , for gas and light bills ; about keeping warm , about keeping well , about meeting the minor emergencies that came_up once , twice , fifty times a day.
   Just dropping the baby 's bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe , and Stuart wore_out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major disaster.
     The Abernathy furnace consumed fuel like a giant ravenous maw that had to be appeased by hurling tons of coal into its evil red depths , and no_matter_how much coal they put_in the house remained cold.
   Cold came_in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have sprung_up , under doors , around loosened window_frames , from the sleeping porches , the attic , from the widened cracks between shingles on the roof.
   Presently they had to give_up running the furnace at full capacity and depend_on the old coal range in the kitchen , which had never been removed when the new gas_range was installed , and the fireplaces and an electric_heater in Grandma 's room.
   It was so cold and so wretched that a sort_of desperate gaiety infected all_of them , like people stormbound or shipwrecked or caught in some other freak of circumstance so_that time stood_still and minor anxieties fell_away and the only important thing was to cling together and survive.
     The pipes burst and they all laughed and stood in ice_water to their ankles while they swabbed the bathrooms.
   They lived mainly in the kitchen ; they moved Maggie 's bed and the baby 's basket there , and the rest of them undressed by the stove and ran groaning and shivering to the upper polar regions and plunged into icy beds.
   Grandma said it was just like the early mining camp days , and it was the way people ought to live , only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from_it that she used_to.
      You said a mouthful  , Eugenia said grimly.
   Eugenia hated being cold worse than anything , and she was beginning to find the joys of poverty wearing_thin.
   She said to Maggie that it was one thing to meet an emergency and another to wallow in it , and it was beginning to look at if this one was going_to last forever.
      Plenty of people are poor all their lives .
      Plenty of people have n't our brains and talent .
      I know you when you start talking_about brains and talent  , Maggie said.
    You 're working_up to something , and if you do n't watch_out you 'll ruin your whole life one_of_these_days just to prove that the Abernathy family is superior to everything , even a depression .
      The only thing that worries me is how I 'm going_to prove it  , Eugenia said.
     They begged Grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her , but Grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out , and that she hoped to die in privacy like a Christian and if the Lord willed it to be of pneumonia than it would have to be that way.
   She did n't want to be the only one with a stove in her room , especially as her life span was nearly run_out anyway , and she insisted that Hope have the heater.
   Hope would n't hear of it , and she took the heater back to Grandma 's room , and Grandma took it back to Hope 's room , and the two of them dragged it back_and_forth until Grandma tipped it over and almost set her bedspread on_fire.
   She said that proved she was n't to be trusted with a fire in her room , and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody knowing it.
   Eugenia suspected her of deliberately overturning the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back_and_forth and still wanted her own way , but Hope said if Grandma would n't have the heater nobody would have it , so Grandma had to give_in.
    
     Thrifty of her to use it up.
   Unusual in a case like this , but  -      You can joke!
   Did n't you read it?
   She 's married that tenant!
     I read it , yes.
   This ought to simplify Tolley 's life .
     Laban had more to say.
   Tolley had gone to live in California.
   He 'd mentioned it , himself , at church and everybody seemed to have the idea that Tolley had left because Jenny had jilted him for Roy robards.
    It was plain as the nose on your face that they 're laughing about it , Mamma.
   Zion stayed to get my pin , but it 'll be a cold day in June when I go_back .
      We will both go_back , Laban !
   Kizzie turned to go inside.
    Let me stay and take the pictures you wanted , Mamma.
   The sun 's right  -      Pictures ?
   She swung around.
    What pictures ?
      In Brace 's room!
   You told me to bring my camera.
   I 'm not going_back  -      Indeed you are!
   Why should I want pictures of an empty room now?
   Tolley had no idea of marrying that sneaky little Jenny!
   This - trip of his had nothing to do with her consorting with tenants , and I am going_to see that everybody at Mt._Pleasant understands that simple fact.
   Wait for me , Laban , I 'll be dressed in half a second !
     Frank followed her into the bedroom , hooked her dress up the back.
      Hurry , Frank!
   They 're not going_to laugh_at the Fairbrothers and Labans very long!
   Tolley 's going is my fault.
   I drove him away.
   You know it and I 'll tell everybody exactly how it happened .
     She was so beautiful , so valiant , so pitiable.
   He kissed her.
    Make your confession to God , Kizzie dear , not to the congregation .
      I 'll decide that when I get there.
   I was so cruel to Tolley , so unfair.
   But I 'll be fair now!
   He is coming_back , is n't he , Frank ?
     Yes , oh yes.
   What else was_there to say?
   Returning to the log-house he found some favorite lines from Jonathan_Swift on his lips :  Under the window in stormy weather I marry this man and woman together.
     Let none but Him who rules the thunder Put this man and woman asunder .
     Absolution for his lie?
   He questioned God 's taking time to telegraph the message , but he felt better about Kizzie , and he took the sealed envelope from its pigeonhole , wondering why he had preserved it.
   If he died before she did , she would never be unable to resist opening it.
   In_any_case he would be thrusting a burden on his remaining sons , making them parties to a deception peculiarly his own.
   It was simply his necessity to confess which had made him write and keep this thing.
    You 've told God , Frank  , he said.
    Why lacerate the - congregation ?
     Reaching for an old clay pot , relic of pioneer days , he tore the envelope in pieces , dropping them into it , touching the little pyre to flame , watching it curl , the red sealing_wax melting and bubbling in the feathery ash.
   Surely now his beloved son could rest_in_peace.
      ' And let me go , for the night gathers me , and in the night shall no man gather fruit  '.
   A beautiful and haunting line , a subtle genius , Swinburne , difficult not to envy a gifted man , and perhaps he did.
     But there were great satisfactions , even for a small man.
   Beyond his window were the greening trees , new spring , eternal hope , eternal_life.
   There lay Grand_Fair 's Quinzaine , his own young parents ' graves , but new life and promise for his sons , grandsons.
   He poured his thimble of wine for the toast he 'd made so often.
    To absent loved_ones .
   But this last time he drank not to Brace but  To Tolley !
     Mr._Robards - Jenny was the only person she knew of in the Mt._Pleasant neighborhood who called him that - was kind but too easygoing.
   It did n't bother him for everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say ,  Howdy , Miss_Jenny  , adding a careless  Roy  , but it did her.
     He could put a stop to_it , she told him again_and_again.
   Simply call Mr._Whipsnade_Oscar , and Dr._Dunne_P._G. , and C ' un Major_Frank.
   Mr._Robards laughed , said he 'd feel a damn fool , plain-out could n't do that even to please her.
      You could try.
   And if I ever hear you say ' Mist_Laban ' again I 'll scream.
   And do n't tell me you did n't at church Sunday.
   I heard you !
     He really had n't meant to , he assured her , but it was plain to her that the importance of these small things was lost on Mr._Robards.
   How strange it was that he could give her this handsome house and carte_blanche as to its beautiful furnishings , and fail her in - spiritual ways.
     Another weakness - far more irritating than his manner_of_speaking , which he made only token effort to change - was his devotion to_that old horse of Tolley 's.
   Her horse , rather.
   But Mr._Robards ' now , oh my yes , indeed , yes!
   He called her  the Mare  much_as Mrs._Whipsnade spoke of  the Queen , God bless her .
   He , with fifteen or twenty horses or mares or geldings or what-nots out there in the barn , was reverent only of  the Mare  ,  the Racin ' Mare  , the revolting Gunny.
     For the first few months of their marriage she had tried to be nice about Gunny , going out with him to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall.
   And what had happened?
   Gunny invariably tried to bite her.
   Nerves , Mr._Robards said , just a nip anyway.
    Stand_back , Miss_Jen , she 's oneasy of your scarf .
   Never ,  Quit that , you sor ' l devil !
   Never concern for his wife 's nerves , or the danger that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in January.
   She mus n't annoy Gunny whose foal was due then too!
     Listening for hours to his laments that the war and  Mist_Fair 's  poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many_a racing triumph , and to his predictions of greatness for the procession of foals to come , Jenny could look_forward to years of conflict with an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it.
   Gunny symbolized so_much that was unpleasant - Tolley , the indifference with which the Fairbrothers and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her and which she would die rather_than acknowledge to her husband , his lack of understanding and sympathy in her present condition , her disgusting swollen stomach.
     Human birth was no novelty to Mr._Robards.
   Tillie was a fine midwife and could get here quick , he suggested.
   Jenny 's aversion to having Dr._Dunne , a former admirer , seemed silly to him , but he would humor her , get anybody she wanted , the best never being too good for her.
     The chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came , she was sure.
   He would be in the barn , or riding for the veterinarian!
   Night after night he stayed with Gunny in the dead of winter , rubbing her with quarts of expensive liniment , fussing over her bran mash as the cook did over charlotte_russe , tracking manure on the pretty new carpet when he did come to the house.
   Yet when the dear baby came , he had Tillie over_here in a jiffy , and was as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when it was all_over as any husband could have been.
     Jenny wished now that she had had Dr._Dunne , feeling that somehow he would n't have allowed the dear baby to turn_into triplets.
   There was something not nice about triplets , though their father seemed pleased , showing no disappointment that they had n't been the son he wanted , saying ,  You do n't see triplets trippin ' down the pike ever ' day , Miss_Jen , hon.
   Rhyme ' em up cute - Arcilla , Flotilla .
     Edmonia for her mother , she said firmly , Jennifer , for herself , and -.
      Kezziah , for Miss_Kizzie  , he suggested.
    She was mighty good to you past_times , an ' this 'll fetch her .
   Now she must be thinking_of a boy-name , something special.
   Just wait till she saw the Mare 's foal.
   Handsomest colt in_all Kentucky.
   Strong too , up_on his legs when he was an hour old.
   What about Royal_Robards?
      Why do n't you name him Jesus_Christ!
    She burst into tears.
     Roy was deeply distressed.
   He 'd had no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had been.
   Of_course she was n't herself right_now , but as her strength came_back her spirits did n't seem to rise with_it.
   He had a good idea why not.
   Those elegant  At_Home  cards she sent_out , now she could wear her pretty clothes again , and had the house all trimmed up , had n't brought many callers in two whole months.
     Doc_Dunne and Miss_Sis had come.
   So had Miss_Shawnee_Rakestraw , full_of criticisms about the changes here , giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his Heavenly_Rest last year , saying how much she enjoyed her boarding_house in town in inclement weather , was looking_forward to Quinzaine_Spa this summer.
     There was an idea.
   Miss_Kizzie had been right snippy ever since they were married , though you 'd have thought a namesake would have brought her round.
   Oh , she 'd come to see them once , left silver teething_rings for all_of the trips.
   But when Miss_Jen went over right_away to return the call , Miss_Kiz could n't have been very cordial , for she 'd come_back before she hardly had time to get there.
   More_and_more , these days , she 'd been driving that pretty little mare that looked_like her , over to Tillie 's and Nick 's - his own old square frame box on posts , chickens and cats and pups under the house , everybody friendly inside , making a to-do over the babies dressed like dollies.
   Though he was glad she got_on well with his young folks , she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land , too.
     It made him pretty hot_under_the_collar , after the idea Miss_Sis had given him , to be told by Miss_Kiz that her holy spa was all reserved for this summer and next , if you please , and that_much as she regretted it , they would be unable to entertain Mrs._Robards and the children.
   She hoped they were_well.
     He did n't tell Miss_Jen , but she must have got_word from the cook or nurse , who of_course knew those Quinzaine nigs , and she really took a fit.
   If he ever did such a thing again she 'd die of shame.
      Have a party an ' leave ' em out , hon  , he suggested.
    A swell party , send an invite to ever ' body but them - those folks you met at the Galt_House , the ones I 've got to know in_this new Jockey_Club affair , the whole dang neighborhood.
   We 'll have oystchers - couple bar ' l oystchers 'll fetch in a crowd any time.
   I 'll see word gets round .
      Do n't you dare!
    Miss_Jen was funny that way , funny that she did n't seem to take_to his ideas and perk_up.
   He was downright worried about her , but there was one more thing he could try.
     Zion was surprised when Roy 's buggy stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that Eph_Showers had had a call to preach in some mountain town.
     Roy smiled - he did have a nice smile - took_off his hat most politely , told her to hop in , and he 'd give her a lift to Quinzaine.
   Her hesitation was only momentary and she hoped he did n't notice it , as she settled herself , asked quickly how Miss_Jenny and the babies were getting_on.
      See for yourself , Miss_Zion.
   It won n't take a minute .
   He swung in through his own wide gateway.
    Them 's the purtiest babes you ever did see , but Miss_Jen gets mighty lonesome.
   She 'll relish the sight of a friendly face.
   Miss_Kiz won n't care your comin ' , will she ?
      Why of_course not  , Zion said uncomfortably.
    
     He must have forgiven me  , Henrietta murmured to the room.
   The absolution of Doaty 's last will and testament was proof enough of_that ; Doaty would never have left her house to a godless woman.
     She found herself wishing an old wish , that she had told Doaty she was running_away , that she had left something more behind her than the loving , sorry note and her best garnet pin.
   Perhaps Doaty had guessed already and kept her counsel.
     Henrietta thought , It 's extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us.
   There had been more to know about Hetty , inevitably , and most_of it unfavorable.
   Adelia was the good one , or , if_not always good , less frequently tempted.
   Their childhood would have been quite circumspect without Hetty 's flair for drama , especially through the long summers.
   In winter , in the city , there had been the Maneret_School , which taught excellently with a kind_of austere passion for knowledge ; there had been lessons in French from a small Polish nobleman with a really profound distaste for his pupils ; there had been the dancing class - Miss_Craddock , thin and tireless , with her supervising wand and her everlasting one-two-three , one-two-three.
   There had been supper parties and teas , fetes and little balls , Mama small and pretty and gay and Papa enormously jocular , enormously possessive , the sun around which the Blackwell planets revolved.
     Mama had died before the corruption of the family_circle , the interruption of Charles.
   It was safe to assume that Papa , sighing heavily , had said many_times to his remaining daughter ,  Thank God your poor mother was spared this  , and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for Henrietta to leave , with her hand in Charles ' hand , just because her  poor mother  was gone already and would never know.
   Mama was vulnerable ; one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her.
     But I would have gone anyway , thought Henrietta.
   She had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice.
   Only at this moment - perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in Doaty 's bed - she found herself examining how others might regard her.
   Perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of_that ability to see a choice.
     She turned on her side , finding the idea oppressive.
   If Adelia had felt about someone as Henrietta felt about Charles , would she have run_away with him?
     Impossible to imagine Adelia feeling so about anyone.
   No temptation , no sin.
     No temptation , no virtue?
     A curious thought to end a curious night.
   The_birds were really awake now in a colloquy of music , and light was beginning to creep across the room , touching sill and door , table and chair and all_of Doaty 's flowers in their artificial blossom and leaf.
     Before_anything_else , she would go to Doaty 's grave with flowers from Doaty 's forgotten garden.
   Everything must wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards.
   She closed her eyes , remembering the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone_walls.
   It had always seemed to rain there , and even the grass was gray.
     After the sad impatient moment , waiting for comfort which could not come , she slipped out_of_bed and went to the open window.
   The garden below was lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness.
   Leaning out , she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle , one not_quite come_to bloom , one just beyond it.
   On a thrusting spray thick_with thorns and dewdrops and swelling pink buds , like a summer Valentine , a bird balanced and sang , nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music , a_little engine of song.
     It was so pretty and artless that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running_out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things , but Doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme d ' un certain age.
   Feeling suddenly neat and subdued , she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs.
     Rosa , unbelievably , was not_yet up and about , reassurance that Rosa was human.
   Feeling protective toward this sleeping being , Henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot.
     Outside , the garden , the tame wilderness , yielded a patchwork bouquet of daisies , sweet_william , scented stock and lady 's bedstraw , which she tied with long grasses and took back to show Rosa , who was now stirring about the kitchen and haranguing Folly.
   The poodle came gleefully to Henrietta and begged for the flowers , supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws.
     Henrietta held her bouquet out_of_reach and said it was for Doaty.
    Rummaging in the dew  , said Rosa coldly.
    Go change your shoes before you turn_around .
   She sounded so exactly like Doaty that Henrietta obeyed her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay home.
   Folly danced , eager_for whatever lay beyond the door.
     To a Blackwell , there was only one church.
   The cemetery slumbered just behind it , and the way lay through the village and close_to the sea.
   For_the_first_time in thirty years , Henrietta walked down the narrow street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying her with the frankest curiosity.
   She smiled and bowed , recalling the princess-in-a-carriage feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child.
   Now , some of the acknowledgments were cautious , but all were interested.
     An old_man , sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him , gave her a more_than reflective look as she passed , the sap still plainly rising in his branches.
   On an impulse , she turned back and said good_morning.
     He cupped his ear and shook his head at her repetition , announcing in a nettled way that he had heard her the first time.
   He then offered his own estimate of the weather , which was unenthusiastic.
    Summer 's been slow to come  , he said.
    It 's my dryin_'_out time .
   He scowled at her flowers.
      I 'm taking them to the cemetery  , said Henrietta , out of a vague feeling of hospitality.
      They 'll be takin ' me next  , he said pleasantly ,  but not so soon 's they plan.
   See half of ' em in their graves before I choose my own coffin.
   It 's dryin ' myself out that does_it .
   He regarded her with rising hope.
    You 'd like to hear how I go_about it .
      It 's nice of you  , Henrietta said doubtfully.
      Y 're welcome .
   He straightened himself , soldierly against the wall , and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side_by_side in their old boots.
   His stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text.
    Every_month , f ' r three days  , he said happily ,  I take no water into my system , no water whatsoever.
   It rests the tissues .
     Henrietta murmured that she could quite see how it would , and he nodded approval of her womanly good_sense.
    Rests the tissues  , he said ,  and pacifies the system.
   My dad did_it , and he lived to a great age .
   He looked up at her sharply.
    Do n't remember , do you ?
     She did suddenly , through the link of memory with his father , old Titus , who must have been in his nineties when Henrietta ran_away.
   Next to the Blackwells , Titus had owned the island most , and she and Adelia had often stood in front of him , silenced by his terrible years - a scanty man with a thin beard and very deep-set blue eyes like a mariner , more aged than possible.
   He had never spoken once to the awed sisters , but his son had been friendly , a big fellow of fifty or more , a fishing-boat captain and powerful like the sea.
   It must be that son who sat before her now , shriveled to half his size and half his senses.
     She said gently ,  Of_course I remember you .
      Not so well 's I remember you  , he said.
    Y 're the young Blackwell woman.
   Ran_away on a black night with a lawful wedded man.
   I know all about you .
      You do seem to  , said Henrietta , impressed.
      Ca n't blame a man for leavin ' his wife  , he said quite cheerfully.
    Left mine many_a time , only she never knew it.
   Man in a boat , there 's a_lot_of places he can put_in at and a_lot_of reasons he can be away for a_bit.
   Any harm in_that ?
      Probably  , said Henrietta dryly.
     He gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly.
    You 'd be the one to say  , he observed , and she found herself liking his approval none too well , but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were  different  , since all actions had their own laws.
   Only , this old_man 's connivance was even_less to her taste than Selma_Cotter 's open censure.
   Well , she had not come_back to Great_Island to be understood , praised or condemned.
   She had come to make her peace with the past , and of_that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind_of shadow.
     She started to move away , just_as a woman came_out of the cottage , a big-boned , drab-haired figure with a clean apron tied over her limp print dress.
   She smiled vaguely at Henrietta and spoke_to the old_man.
    You 've not had your breakfast yet , gran ' dad .
      Y ' r dam ' porridge is no breakfast  , he said.
    Milk and sops !
   He beat the air with his stick , and it fell from his claws and clattered on the stones.
      He 's owly today  , his grand-daughter said wearily , and bent to pick it up.
    He 's got this idea about drying_out .
      It ai n't an idea !
      If it ai n't an idea  , she said ,  how comes it you can drink beer but not water ?
     He looked piously to heaven and said ,  Beer do n't affect the tissues none  , and the ingenious hypocrisy of_this defense pleased Henrietta so_that she forgave him his stint of malevolence.
     His grand-daughter sighed.
    Come_on , do.
   The children are eating , and Miss_Blackwell 's on her way somewheres .
      To the graveyard.
   Who ai n't ?
      Not me.
   I 've got a day 's work to do.
   - You 'll be visiting Miss_Doaty , ma_'_am ?
     Henrietta nodded.
   How much they knew about her!
     The woman ( she must have been a tiny baby when Hetty and Delia had stood arm in arm , watching great age grow small ) answered the nod with her own.
    God rest her soul , she was a sweet one.
   Come on now .
   She put a strong hand under the old_man 's arm and lifted him up , patiently , with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old.
   He mumbled at her but let himself be led off inside the house , shuffling mightily to make it clear how weak and aged he was and_how he was buffeted about by those who still had their wicked strength.
     There was a gabble of voices from indoors , young hungry sounds like cats after fish , and a burst of swearing from the old_man.
   Henrietta looked down at her bouquet , still lively with its color and scent , and set her feet on their journey 's way again , leaving the village street and crossing the first field , Folly dancing ahead of her.
     At the edge of the field , the wild rolling land took_over , dotted with fat round bushes like sheep.
   They were covered with tiny white blossoms , their scant roots clawing at the stony ground , and wild birds darted in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry.
     The air was full of sounds too but placid ones , a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out_of_the_blue sky.
   She felt mindless , walking , and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near the cemetery , and she caught herself wondering what she would say to Doaty.
     Both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered them ( how many things had lessened while she was gone away ) but the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named  Dorothy_Tredding  seemed suddenly impossible.
     She sat_down on the nearest , fallen with age and gray with sea-damp , her fingers tracing the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss.
   The day 's sun was gathering its strength in gold , and she wished she had brought her parasol , if only to shade Doaty 's flowers.
   A small , rock-carved angel watched her from a nearby tomb , the only angel in the cemetery.
     She remembered , suddenly , a night of savage moonlight and scudding clouds when she and Adelia , having dared each other , had stolen out of their great safe house and come here , hand_in_hand , hoping and fearing ghosts.
    
    The Momoyama family had come from Miyagi_Prefecture , in the northeast of the main Japanese island of Honshu , where there are still traces of the mysterious Ainu strain.
   The Ainus were a primitive people , already living on the island before the principal ancestors of the Japanese came from Southern_Asia.
   Apparently they were of Caucasian blood.
   They had white skins and blue eyes ; all their men were bearded , and many_of their women were beautiful.
   A pitiful few of them are left now , to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient tribal chants , which have the same haunting sadness as the laments of the American_Indians.
   Most_of them have been assimilated , but sometimes a man in Miyagi or Akita prefectures is much more hairy than the average Japanese , and occasionally a girl will be strikingly lovely , her coloring warmed and improved by a_little of the tawny honey-in-the-sun tint of the invaders from the South.
     Tommy_Momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions.
   She was taller than most Japanese girls , and had the exquisitely willowy form of the Japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall.
   Her nose was higher of bridge , her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible_to sunburn , and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong.
   Her mouth , soft and full , was something for any man to dream about.
   She had black_eyes , long and intriguingly tilted , and the way she walked was melody.
     She had been in Japan just one week.
   It was an alien land , and she hated it intensely ; she was already considering putting_in rebellious requests for duty at San_Diego , Bremerton , the Great_Lakes , Pensacola - any place the Navy had a hospital - with a threat to resign her commission if the request were not granted.
   Anywhere would be better than the land of her ancestors.
     There was nothing wrong with her job.
   Tommy had been assigned to the psychopathic ward.
   There were no depressingly serious cases : the ward doctor sometimes teamed_up with the chaplain to serve as a marriage counselor - sometimes the Navy sent people back to the States to preserve a marriage - but mental_health as a rule was very high.
   At_present the doctor 's main concern was in seeing_to_it that Japanese salvage firms were not permitted to operate on the hulks of warships sunk too_close inshore , because the work involved setting_off nerve-shattering blasts at_all hours.
   Tommy was interested in psychiatry , because there was much an understanding nurse could do to help the patients.
     But she suffered in her off-duty hours.
   Such_as now , when she sat at a table in the coffee_shop at the Officers ' Club , having coffee and a hamburger to sustain her until dinnertime.
   She had changed into a cocktail_dress , and the whole evening should have been before her , but already she was beginning to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck.
   This was one of the Navy 's crossroads - you find them all_around the world.
   Ships from the West_Coast rotated on six-month tours_of_duty with the Seventh_Fleet , and Yokosuka was the Seventh_Fleet 's principal port for maintenance , upkeep and shore liberty.
   Sooner_or_later , all the gray Navy ships came_in here ; if Tommy sat long enough , she would be sure to see all the young officers she had met in San_Diego and Long_Beach.
   And she wanted desperately to see someone she had known back there.
     She felt , rather_than saw , the approach of the good-looking young_man.
   He came_through from the Fleet_Bar , which was stag , with the ice_cubes tinkling in a glass he carried.
   When he saw Tommy sitting alone , the tinkling sound stopped.
   He was perhaps a_trifle tipsy , having been long at_sea where drinking is not permitted , and consequently out_of_practice ; he wore a brown tweed sports_jacket obviously tailored in Hong_Kong , and he was of an age that marked him as a lieutenant.
   Probably off one of the carriers - an aviator.
   There was a fifty-fifty chance , perhaps , that he would be unmarried , and an even more slender chance that his approach would be different.
   Japan did something to_a_man - and it was n't just Japan , either , because the same thing applied anywhere overseas.
   It was as if foreign duty implied and excused license ; it intimated that the folks at_home would never know about it , and , therefore , why not?
     Then the young_man in the brown sports_jacket spoke , and it was no different.
      Harro , girl-san !
 he said , turning_on what was meant to be charm.
    You catchee boy-furiendo?
   Maybe you likee date with me ?
      I beg_your_pardon !
   Tommy said out of her cold rage.
    I do n't believe I know you , and I can n't understand your quaint brand of English - it was meant to be English , was n't it ?
     The nice-looking young officer fell_back on his heels , open-mouthed and blushing.
   At_least , he had the decency to blush , she thought.
      Oh - I 'm sorry!
   You see , I thought - I mean I really had no idea  -      Oh , yes - you had ideas !
   Tommy interrupted furiously.
    All wrong ones !
   Then she jerked her thumb toward the door in a very American gesture , and dropped into Navy slang.
    Take_off , fly-boy !
      Uh - sorry !
 he muttered , and took_off , obviously feeling like a fool.
   The trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in_this for Tommy.
   She felt like a fool , too.
     It had n't been this way in college , or in nurses ' training ; it was n't this way in the hospital at San_Diego.
   Everybody had accepted her for what she was - a very charming girl.
   Nobody had addressed her in broken English at any of those places , nobody had suggested that she was n't American.
   There are Spanish girls who look_like Tommy_Momoyama , brunettes with a Moorish hint of the Orient in their faces ; there are beauties from the Balkan_states who are similarly endowed , and - back in the blessed United_States - they were regarded simply as pretty women.
   Now , having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not asked for , Tommy was being humiliated at every turn.
     She looked_around , self-consciously.
   Four little Japanese waitresses were murdering the_English language at the counter - Yuki_Kobayashi happened to be one of them.
   Everybody but Tommy seemed to think it was charming when they called ,  Bifutek-san !
 for a steak sandwich , or  Kohi futotsu !
 for one cup of coffee.
   Two other Japanese girls were sitting at the tables , both quite pretty and well groomed.
   One was with a whitehaired and doting lieutenant_commander ; the other was with her American husband and their exceptionally appealing children.
   Seeing these did_nothing for Tommy 's mood.
   She told herself rebelliously , and with_pride , I am an American!
     And so she was , and would remain.
   But she was learning that so_long as she was in_this country , and wore civilian_dress in the Club , there would always be transient young_men who would approach her with broken English.
   There had been occasions when some of the more experienced had even addressed her in_what might have been perfectly good Japanese.
   Tommy would n't know ; after coming to America , her parents had spoken only English.
     One thing was becoming increasingly sure.
   She had been sent to the wrong place for duty.
   There was more to service in the Navy_Nurse_Corps than the hours in the ward.
   One had_to have friends , and a congenial life in after-duty hours.
     Now there was raucous male singing from the Fleet_Bar.
   It was terribly off key , and poorly done , and Tommy could never admit to herself that male companionship was a very natural and important thing , but all_at_once she felt lonesome and put-upon.
   She finished her hamburger and drank her coffee and paid her check ; she got_out of the coffee_shop before the incident could be repeated.
   Eating while angry had given her a slight indigestion.
   Back in her living_quarters at the hospital she took bicarbonate_of_soda , and sulked.
     Then , after a while , she went to her mirror.
   It was all true.
   She certainly looked Japanese , and perhaps she could not really blame the young_men.
   And , still , they did not have_to be so crude in their approach.
     There was a letter to write to her mother , and she tried to make its tone cheerful.
   She promised that she would soon take a_few day 's leave and visit the uncle she had never seen , on the island of Oyajima - which was not very far from Yokusuka.
   And tomorrow she would take time to shop for the kimono her mother wanted to present to the young wife of a faculty_member as a hostess gown.
     Tommy , of_course , had never heard of a kotowaza , or Japanese proverb , which says ,  Tanin yori miuchi  , and is literally translated as  Relatives are better than strangers .
     Actually , this is only another way of saying that blood is thicker than water.
     Doc_Doolittle 's scheduled appearance at captain 's mast was a very unusual thing , because the discipline dispensed there is ordinarily for the young and immature , and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report.
   But the beer hall riot in Subic had been unusual , too , and Walt_Perry was convinced that Doc had started it through some expert tactics in rabble rousing.
   Just why anybody should wish to start a riot the executive_officer did n't know.
   In his opinion , Doc had not grown_up.
     The lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief.
   There had never been a good reason for Doc_Doolittle to grow_up.
   He had come into the Navy too young , with the image of the fun-loving Guns Appleby before him.
   The war found him much too early , and its perils - and especially its awful boredom - were best forgotten in horseplay and elaborate practical_jokes , and even now Doc had never found any stabilizing , sobering influence.
   He remained young at_heart , with an overdeveloped sense_of_humor.
   He wisecracked about the captain 's indoctrination of new men , took great delight in slaughtering cockroaches with ethyl chloride , and gave no thought for tomorrow.
   He was doing thirty years , and the Navy would take care of him.
   The job security enjoyed by Doc_Doolittle , and nearly all members of the Armed_Forces , is a wonderful thing.
   Actually , all a man in uniform has_to do is to get_by.
   He may_not rise to the heights , but he can get_by , and eventually be retired.
     Doc had been under restriction to the ship since the Bustard left Subic.
   This deprived him of liberty in Hong_Kong , but he told Boats McCafferty that Hong_Kong was a book he had read before , and the Navy would always bring him there again , some_day.
   At Yokosuka he was restricted to the confines of the Base because Walt_Perry , being thoughtful , knew that Doc might have_to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the Supply_Base.
   This gave Doc the whole range of the naval establishment , and suited him quite well.
   There were two things he wanted to do : inspect one of the many caves that had been dug into the hills on the Naval_Base , and visit an old shipmate.
     A telephone_line had been hooked_up to connect the ship with the Base exchange.
   After supper , Doc called Whitey_Gresham , who was now a lieutenant and had a family.
      Well , Doc , you old sonofabitch !
   Whitey exclaimed , with true affection.
    Come over and have a drink.
   We live down by the Base commissary.
   Grab a taxi .
      I 'll be there , but I 'll walk  , Doc said.
    I 've got_to run an errand on_the_way.
   See you in about an hour .
     He threw a smart salute at the gangway , went up the dock , and turned down the wide street in_front of the Petty_Officers ' Club.
    
    How , he wondered , does one enjoy one 's spare_time?
   He considered some interesting excursion but he was on the road every_day from dawn to dusk.
   Then there was exercise , boating and hiking , which was not_only good_for_you but also made you more virile : the thought of strenuous activity left him exhausted.
   Perhaps golf , with a fashionable companion - but he 'd lost his clubs , had n't played in years.
   There was swimming over at the Riverside_Hotel , but his skin was so white he looked_like the bottom of a frog.
   Perhaps a packing trip into the Sierras , let his beard grow - but that was too stark.
   I could , he thought , take a long walk - but where?
     The telephone rang.
      You missed it  , Buzz 's voice said ,  You should have gone over to the Pagan_Room with us.
   Wow.
   Strippers , but scrumptious , and Toodle_Williams and her all-lesbian band .
      Hi , Buzz  , Owen said.
    I went over to the Willows and dropped two notes .
      Tough  , Buzz said ,  Listen , we 're having a stag dinner over at the Pagan_Room on Friday.
   Imagine a stag dinner with Toodle_Williams .
   He laughed and laughed.
     Owen wanted to be pleasant because Buzz worked the territory next to his , but he had n't come to Reno for stag dinners.
    Thanks  , Owen said ,  but Friday is a long way off and anything can happen .
     Buzz was a tireless instigator who never let his victims rest.
   When Owen was finally rid of him , there was a timid rap at the door.
      Yes  , Owen called_out.
    Yes ?
      I 'm Mrs._Gertrude_Parker  , a soft voice explained ,  And I 'd like to talk to you for a_few minutes , please .
     Ahah , he thought , a lush divorcee at_last.
   Probably saw me in the lobby.
   He was disappointed to find a nervous , scrawny woman with a big hat standing at the door.
   She frowned at his green pajamas with the yellow moons.
      How_do_you_do ?
 she said , semi-professionally.
    Our church is sponsoring a group of very courageous women up in Alaska.
   We call them lay-sisters and they go among the Eskimos making friends and bringing the light.
   They 're up there in_that freezing climate and all_of us have to try and help them .
      Oh ?
      You see  , she said , looking past him into the room , where the highball glasses sparkled dully in the bright light ,  you and I can n't understand the many hardships they have to undergo .
      Why is that ?
     She apparently was n't satisfied with his reaction.
   Smug , Owen thought , smug and sappy.
   There was a slight nervous twitch in the region of her left eye.
   It gave her a lewd , winking effect.
      Have you ever tried to reason with an Eskimo ?
   she asked , winking wildly.
    They are a very difficult group of people .
      I do n't know much about them  , Owen admitted ,  but I suppose they have their own religion and they probably resent outsiders coming_in and telling them what to do and what not to do .
     She smiled in a sickly-tolerant fashion.
    You know , that 's very interesting.
   People do n't know how much they give_away about themselves by remarks like that.
   The more canvassing I do , the more I note how far most people are from their personal God .
     Forebearing , Owen kept his peace.
   What would happen next?
   That she was out for a touch was certain , but when did she get_to the pitch?
   Several people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly retreated , trying to close the door a_little , and she slowly leaned toward him and raised her voice.
      How did you get_by the desk ?
 he asked curiously.
    I 'm sure the hotel does n't know you 're wandering around the corridors , knocking on strangers ' doors and talking_down Eskimos .
      Oh , I just come once a week.
   Every_day I visit a different hotel.
   I feel it 's my duty.
   I do this work all on my own , because I understand the difficulties and I want to help these lay-sisters.
   Do you know these women go all through Alaska , and they do n't have the proper facilities?
   They travel in pairs as much_as a hundred-and-fifty miles a day .
      Do you have any idea how far I travel every_day?
   I have the whole Pacific_Northwest .
   Owen was aware he was getting overexcited but he could n't help himself.
     Mrs. gertrude Parker drew_back.
    That 's hardly_a Christian approach  , she remonstrated.
    You 're in the secular world .
      I did n't say it was Christian.
   I do n't think you 'll find many active Christian salesmen.
   Not that religion is n't big business ; those bibles and prayer_books make a_lot_of money for publishing_houses , but they do n't get top personnel.
   Our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics .
      God , I take it , plays no part in_this  , she said waspishly.
      God does n't have any appliance or cosmetics  , he said heatedly before he caught himself.
   It sounded silly ; why go_on?
   More people were passing ; he had_to find some way to close this impossible conversation.
      And whiskey  , she said , smiling and blinking at the highball glasses.
    Do n't forget whiskey ; it 's such a big seller .
      You know  , he said , getting a grip on himself ,  I think you 're going_to have to excuse me.
   I have an appointment .
      I can imagine  , she said.
    Probably down at the bar.
   But what do you want to do about the lay-sisters?
   They must be freezing up there now.
   Ca n't you help them ?
      Leave a card or something.
   I 'll think it over .
      I have no card  , she said bitterly.
    You have n't been listening to what I 've been telling you.
   I only hope my talking to you has helped you a_little , anyway , because you need spiritual bucking-up .
   She looked crestfallen , as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human_race.
   She stood indecisively for a moment , then walked down the hall ; he heard her knocking on another door.
     It took him about fifteen minutes to calm himself ; then he realized he was hungry.
   He showered , shaved , dressed and went_down to the dining_room for breakfast.
   On_the_way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail.
   There was a check from his company , and the usual enthusiastic bulletins on new_lines they always issued.
   His lawyer had sent him a statement on his overdue alimony , and there was a letter from the Collector_of_Internal_Revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last year 's exemptions.
     He ate breakfast in a sullen mood , but afterwards , when he walked out onto Virginia_Street , he felt braced.
   He looked off to the crest of the Sierras , still white-topped ; the glisten of the Truckee_River made a wide spangle.
   He felt suddenly elated , adventurous.
   With any luck at_all he could easily find a flowerpot.
     Although it was only three o ' clock , he stopped in at the Golden_Calf.
   The tables were all spinning , the dice rattling , the bar crowded.
   Just to test himself , he played roulette for quarters on his old combination , five and seventeen , and within an hour , he had won , surprisingly , twenty dollars.
   The way was opening_up ; when the management brought around champagne , the breakfast settled its whirling_around in his stomach.
     The Golden_Calf was dimly lit with shaded neon.
   There were more women than men in the place , but he could n't find a flowerpot.
   They all had the hard look of gamblers who had stopped dreaming , who automatically turned the cards , hardly caring what showed_up.
   The mural around the wall depicted early settlers in covered_wagons , who appeared much more animated than the gamblers.
   The women had a bright shining expectancy as they leaned out from the wall and gazed splendidly into the distance , while the men were stern but hopeful.
   All , of_course , except the Donner party who were bent_on starving to death.
      I wonder if they did eat each other at the end  , Owen mused.
     He sat_down next to a heavily-upholstered blonde , but she was cleaned_out in twenty minutes.
   She sighed a dirty word and left.
   Owen was surprised to see Mrs._Gertrude_Parker playing the one-arm bandits that were cunningly arranged by the entrance.
   She sat_down and played two slots at_once , looking grim , as if bested by mechanical_devices , and Owen felt sorry_for the lay-sisters depending_on her support.
     A dried-up cowboy sat_down next to him in the blonde 's place.
   He was a_little more authentic than usual because he smelled slightly of the stables.
    What you need is a steady martingale  , the cowboy announced after watching Owen play.
    You can n't build_on your hit-and-miss five-seventeen .
      What are you playing ?
   Owen asked.
      I 'm just logging  , the cowboy explained.
    I keep all these plays in_this little black_book , and I watch over a twelve-hour period to find_out what numbers are repeating.
   But roulette 's not my game.
   I 'm always trying to find a breaking table in blackjack.
   Incidentally , I 'm pretty famous in these parts : I 'm called The Wrangler .
      Nice to know you.
   Do n't you have to spend any time on your ranch ?
      Well , of_course I do.
   I 'm with the Bar - H , pushing a horse called Sparky.
   He 's my own horse , and what I collect from him I use on blackjack.
   This Sparky can rack and single-foot and he 's the fastest thing in Washoe_County.
   I figure if I can get any kind_of publicity campaign going , I 'll land him on TV - you know , one of those favorite horses for some Western hero.
   I once trained a horse for Hoot_Gibson , but nothing like Sparky.
   He 's a pinto and he photographs wonderfully .
     Five came_up while Owen was listening to The Wrangler and he neglected to play , a loss of ten dollars.
   This proved conclusively that The Wrangler was a jinx , so he walked on down to Hurrays , an even more glorified gambling_den than the Golden_Calf.
   When he looked in_the_back , Mrs._Gertrude_Parker was marking keno cards.
     His adventurous spirit had waned ; he studied the pistol exhibition that Hurrays featured as an added attraction.
   He ogled a long redhead with green eyes , but she was a shill with her money in_front of her.
   He had no great prejudice against shills ; it just seemed such a dry_run.
     There was no cash around ; everyone was flipping silver_dollars.
   The management discreetly withdrew the green stuff into the office and gave the customers chips or checks or premium points.
   He read a special announcement whereby Hurrays would feature a special floorshow at three a. m. starring Adele ( The Body ) Brenner and fourteen glamorous schoolgirls.
     He wondered if he might bag a tourist , but they looked frightened of him.
   He passed two brides , both wearing orchids , and they made him feel a_little sad.
     Owen found Buzz watching chuck-a-luck.
   Buzz had_on a Hawaiian shirt and was carrying some sun-tan oil and dark_glasses.
   He was shorter and fatter than Owen , who felt good standing next to him.
    We 're all going over to Lake_Tahoe and try our luck at Cal-Neva  , Buzz explained , still instigating.
    We ran_into a guy at the Pagan_Room who guarantees we can beat the wheel.
   He started_out as a stickman , then became a pit boss until the Club found him crossroading.
   He was knocking_down checks at faro .
      I 'm allergic to Tahoe  , Owen explained.
    Something about the pollen .
      Well , okay  , Buzz said.
    We 'll see you around later .
     Owen went over to the crap table and the dice were hot , but he could n't pyramid with any consecutive success.
      How 's your luck , honey ?
   A short platinum blonde in a bursting sun-suit addressed him.
   She looked well-fed and prosperous , but he did n't get the impression he was being propositioned the way he 'd been hoping.
      I have n't had any luck since I was a baby .
      Stake me  , she said ,  and let me at those dice.
   I 'll make them dance the tango.
   We 'll get_it in a hurry and get_it out .
      Let 's have a drink and discuss a merger .
      If you go broke  , she said , smiling up at him ,  I 'll leave you .
      Sounds like real love  , Owen said.
    It sort_of brings a lump to my throat .
      My name 's Gisele  , the blonde said after she ordered a Scotch.
    Named after the ballet.
   My mother wanted to call me Sylphide , but it sounded too affected .
    
    Rachel steered me along toward a school for young boys beginning to study the Torah.
   Bits of trash lay in the roadway.
   The air smelled warmish and foul.
     A young man appeared out of a side alley and walked toward us with quick strides.
   He wore a long double-breasted coat of a heavy material , dark trousers , and black boots with buckles.
   His black hat with its wide brim , high crown , and fur trim rode high.
   With his head erect , he approached , not glancing at us , and passed_by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead.
   He had a pinkish-white complexion , a small straight nose , a short black beard , and tightly curled paot.
   I was suddenly conscious of my bare arms.
   The girls in the market place wore long-sleeved dresses and covered their legs with cloth stockings.
   I turned and watched him stride down the center of the road.
   His hands were swinging at his sides , and he passed_through the dingy market place with his back straight and , pivoting on his heel , he entered an old stone building.
     Rachel had seen me watching the young man.
   She smiled.
    When your mother was here he must have been a young boy.
   Like the ones you will see now .
     I swallowed hard and looked down at my feet plodding along beside Rachel.
   She led me into a twisting side alley.
   The dirty , discolored buildings looked boarded_up , and their few windows stood high above our heads.
   Rachel said that schools and synagogues occupied most_of the buildings.
   We entered one where the front_door stood ajar and climbed a flight of steep steps to the main floor.
   An old_man with a white beard and dressed in a long shabby coat , baggy trousers , and a black skullcap greeted us.
   Rachel talked to him.
   He nodded , clasping and unclasping his hands over his paunch , and flicked glances at me.
   I thought he would ask us to leave because Rachel and I were bare-armed , but he looked down into his beard and preceded us down the corridor.
   His toes pointed out toward the walls.
   He stopped in_front of a door , placed a finger on his lips , and , still peering down into his beard , pushed open the door to a classroom.
   We stepped inside.
   He left us.
     Little boys crowded_together on long wooden benches , and in_the_center of the room sat the teacher.
   His black beard dripped down over the front of his coat.
   One white hand poised a stick above his desk.
   He turned his surly , half-closed eyes toward us , stared for a second , then shouted in Yiddish ,  One , two , three !
   rapping the stick against the desk.
   The little boys shrilled out a Yiddish translation or interpretation of the Five Books of Moses , which they had previously chanted in Hebrew.
   They chanted a fixed tune in time to the report of the stick.
   Each boy opened his small mouth wide and rocked back_and_forth on the bench in the way his grandfather and great-grandfather had studied and prayed in the ghettos of Europe.
   The boys were tiny.
   They had large bright eyes , the small upturned noses of all babies everywhere , and hair cropped short except for the long ringlets of paot framing their little white faces.
   They bent over yellowed prayerbooks and looked up only to watch the teacher.
   Since they did not glance curiously at us once , I guessed that there was a penalty for distraction.
   The guttural language from the ghetto stopped.
   The teacher plunged the children into a new portion , this time in Hebrew , rapping the stick incessantly.
     One boy who rocked back_and_forth over his worn book had bright red hair and freckles.
   His tightly curled paot hung down to his narrow shoulders.
   In_the_center of his brilliant curls sat a small black skullcap.
   His head barely rose above the table.
   I stared at him for a long_time.
   He did not return my interest.
   My eyes traveled over the bare walls and up_to the one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the boys.
   Some of them ignored the texts and had apparently memorized the words long_ago.
   They singsonged the portion at the teacher , who accompanied them in an off-key baritone and spurred them on with the stick.
   The tapping defined the rhythm and kept the boys awake.
   I could not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair.
   His body pitched back_and_forth on the bench.
   His front_teeth were missing.
     I shuddered and backed_out of the room.
   Rachel followed , looked at me , and clucked with her tongue.
   We walked down the cool hall silently.
   From behind us came the rapping of the stick and the high-pitched voices of the boys who would grow to devote their lives to rigid study and prayer.
     I said ,  How long do they keep that up ?
      All day  , she said.
    Except for Shabbat , when they are praying all day .
     I rubbed my hands together.
   They had turned numb and prickly in the classroom.
   The old_man in the baggy clothes waited at the foot of the steps.
   He glanced down into his beard and muttered something in Yiddish.
     Rachel said ,  He asks for money .
     She passed_by him.
   I reached_into the pocket of my skirt , fingered ten pruta , and dropped the coin.
   Then I picked it up again and handed it to the old_man.
   He thanked me.
   I did n't look at him.
     I grinned at Rachel.
    Does this bother you ?
   I said.
     She smiled to herself.
    Most_of our Sabras think it 's horrible.
   When we were fighting , a_few of our orthodox people were lying down in the roads so we could not pass.
   They said that we must_not fight but wait for the Messiah .
     I was amazed.
   You had to have convictions to lie_down in the road in_all those clothes and appear as though you might wish to turn yourself out of your own home.
   You had to be stupid or crazy or immortal.
   And I was n't.
   I was American.
   You had to know , also , that you were going_to fail.
   All_of it might have been heroic , but they had done it in the wrong place.
   I resented them.
     Rachel faced me.
   Her bright eyes were twinkling.
   She said ,  Sometimes I think they are keeping religion for us while we play around.
   Your mother hated this way_of_life.
   She wished to change much for the children here .
     I said quietly , respectfully ,  What did she do here?
   In_this section ?
     Rachel clicked her tongue behind her teeth.
    Here , nothing.
   But when she saw the children you have just visited , she wanted to take them away and put them out in the country , in the kibbutzim.
   She loved the children.
   She was a strange woman , your mother.
   When she loved , it was with a passion that drove her along and carried along with her those things she loved.
   Nothing was too impossible for her to do when she wanted.
   She stayed here to work for Aliah.
   For many immigrants , for many children , the first thing they knew of Israel and freedom was your mother.
   Sometimes it was dangerous for her .
   Rachel grinned slyly.
    But she loved danger.
   She took it with her wherever she went ; she chose it.
   And I think she sought_out danger as much_as she sought_out helping other people.
   She was most strange woman.
   Ready_to follow her impulse.
   It was an impulse when she was here in Me ' a She ' arim - I was with her - that led her to stay in Israel.
   Your mother wanted to bring children to Israel so_that they could leave their ghettos.
   Here they did not need to be in ghettos.
   If she could not take the children out of_this section , at_least she could take other children out of their countries and put them on the farms.
   She set_out to make_sure that no Jewish child anyplace in the world had to live in a place such_as this .
     I said quietly , gaining nerve , ready to ask any question at_all , no_matter_how intimate , ready_to be rebuffed ,  Then why did she leave Israel?
   I 'd like to know that very_much .
     Rachel clasped her hands together and slowed her pace.
   The soles of her sandals reported sharply on the cobblestones.
   She pursed her lips , then clamped them together so tightly that I thought she was angry with me.
   But she sighed and her face relaxed.
    Trouble came into her life.
   She had good friends here , people who liked her.
   Who loved her.
   But she had to go_out and hurt herself.
   There was a man here in town.
   He helped her meet people so she could go_out and do the work she wanted.
   She worked very hard.
   There was a refugee who was able to come here because of her.
   He came with his son.
   At_first I thought they were relatives of your mother , but it was not so.
   This refugee was a middle-aged man , a big , handsome man with a strut to his walk as I have never before seen.
   He had the black numerals on his arm , so he had been branded in a concentration_camp.
   Yet he walked like a young man.
   Often he was terribly despondent and talked to no one.
   Then he would walk off for a_few days alone in the direction of Europe.
   All his family was dead , except for his son.
   Your mother would always retrieve him when he wandered off , and she would send him home to his son.
   He loved the son and was always glad to be sent back to him.
   Then his son did something  - Rachel threw up her hands -  I do n't know what , but something , to an official here - it was during the Mandate - and the son was imprisoned.
   A_few hours after the son was arrested , your mother was informed.
   She ran from a_little group of us.
   We were sitting together , talking.
   She went to the father and found he had hanged himself .
   Rachel paused.
   It was silent in the stone alley.
   Then she continued with energy ,  I myself did not see her until a week after she had run_off to find the father.
   No one saw her except the man Reuveni .
      Yes  , I said.
    I know him .
     Rachel gave me a direct , bright-eyed look.
   She said ,  Reuveni wanted your mother to give_up her deep interest in_this refugee.
   He said she would only hurt herself.
   He complained to me once that I must talk to her.
   When I did , she shrugged her shoulders and said that Reuveni wanted her to marry him.
   I asked her if she would , and she said she would not.
   He had known when he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she did not intend to marry him.
   Anyway , I did not see her until two_weeks after the refugee hanged himself.
   She came to me one_day.
   She was pale and skinny ; she was terribly alone.
   And she said that after this man had been dead for a week she had gone to Reuveni and accepted his proposal.
   He shouted at her and told her he loved her and could n't understand why she had upset herself.
   But now he was happy she would let him straighten_out her life and take care of her.
   He would never let her harm herself again.
   For one whole week he never let her stay alone.
   She let him lead her around.
   He took her to a doctor , for she was run_down , nervous , did not care where she was.
   Reuveni took her with him wherever he went.
   He did not let her talk to people ; he did not let her choose her own food.
   She was limp and beaten from her loss ; she did not care.
    
    It was among these that Hinkle identified a photograph of Barco!
   For it seems that Barco , fancying himself a ladies ' man ( and why not , after seven marriages?
 )   , had listed himself for Mormon_Beard roles at the instigation of his fourth murder victim who had said :  With your beard , dear , you ought to be in movies !
     Mills secured Barco 's photograph from the gentleman in charge , rushed to the Hollywood police_station to report the theft , and less_than five minutes later , detectives with his picture in_hand were on the trail of Cal_Barco.
     On their way , they stopped at every gas_station along the main boulevards to question the attendants.
   Finally , at Ye_Olde_Gasse Filling_Station on Avocado_Avenue , they learned that their man , having paused to get oil for his car , had asked about the route to San_Diego.
   They headed in_that direction and , at San_Juan Capistrano_by-the-Sea came_upon Barco sitting in the quaint old Spanish Mission_Drive-in , eating a hot tamale.
   At the moment , Barco 's back was to the road so he did n't see the detectives close_in on his convertible which , in their quest for the stolen lap rug , they proceeded to search.
   The robe , however , was missing , for by that time Barco had disposed of it at a pawnshop in Glendale.
     The detectives placed Barco under arrest and , without informing him of the nature of the charge , took him back to Hollywood for questioning.
     Thus it was that Barco , apprehended for mere larceny , now began to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncovered.
   During the return trip , Barco kept muttering to himself in meaningless phrases , such_as :    They 're under sand_dunes.
   They 're better off , I tell you.
   I saved their souls .
   The detective , commenting on Barco 's behavior , felt that he merely belonged among the myriad citizens of our community who are mentally unhinged - that he was a more_or_less harmless  nut !
     However while in his cell awaiting trial for theft , Barco , in a fit of apprehension , made an attempt to take his own life.
   The attempt had failed because , when endeavoring to cut his wrists , this murderer of seven women had fainted at the sight of blood.
   The jail authorities - attaching no particular significance to the episode - offered Barco whisky to revive him ; but the old fellow , a lifelong teetotaler , refused it , and no_more was thought_of the_matter.
     Then it was that District_Attorney Welch entered the case.
   A man of vaulting ambition , with one eye on the mayorship of Los_Angeles , nothing ever escaped him which might possibly lead to personal publicity.
     It was reported to Welch 's office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide.
   Welch wanted to know why.
   No one knew.
   Now Welch had a pet theory that everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at.
   The suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory to the test.
   So he paid a call on Barco in his cell and began their chat by stating bluntly :      Barco , we 've got the goods on you!
   It 'll be a_lot better if you come_clean .
     At_first Barco was evasive and shifty.
   But with Welch 's relentless pursuit of the subject , Barco finally  broke  and started confessing to one murder after another.
   By the time Barco reached the count of three , the situation seemed to Welch almost too good to be true.
   But if true , it was the case of_which he had dreamed , the case which would throw him into headlines all_over America as the hero of a great murder trial.
     Welch summoned jail officials to Barco 's cell.
   But to Welch 's chagrin , the police_captain pooh-poohed Welch 's credulity in Barco 's confession.
   Barco was clearly a  nut .
   It required strength , bravado , daring to commit murder.
    That worm a murderer?
   Ridiculous !
   Then , for_the_first_time since his arrest , a glint of spirit lit Barco 's eyes.
   His manhood had been attacked.
   He stiffened and rose to his feet.
   He 'd show them!
      Is that so ?
 he queried.
    Well , for ten years I 've been murdering women.
   I can lead you to every one of the bodies , and there ai n't four , nor five , nor six of ' em - there 's seven!
    The next day the police_captain , in derision , organized what he termed  Welch 's Wild_Goose_Chase .
   For indeed it seemed incredible that anyone could go_on committing murder for ten years and not get caught at it , even in Hollywood.
   The searching party consisted_of the police_captain , Welch , Barco , policemen with shovels , newspaper reporters , and cameramen.
     Barco , his state of apprehension gone , never to return , had assumed a matter-of-factness which remained his principal attitude from_that_time_on.
   He directed the cortege of autos to the sand_dunes near Santa_Monica.
   Stopping the cars at a fork in the road , he got_out , paced off a certain distance to a spot between two shrub-covered sand hills , and indicated a location.
     Orders were given to dig.
   Nothing was found.
   Welch was worried.
   The police_captain chortled.
   The newspaper boys cracked jokes and again Barco 's pride was aroused.
   With greater precision he again paced off a location , this time a_little more to the left.
     With quibs and gibes , the policemen again started digging.
   Welch was on edge.
   The captain was remarking that it was a nice day for a picnic when finally one of the shovels struck an object.
      There 's something here !
 said the digger.
   Joking stopped and everyone gathered around.
   The digger , thrusting about with his shovel , now raised into view a package crudely wrapped in one of the murderer 's Hollywood sport_shirts.
   Although it was a mere fragment of the victim 's remains , it was enough.
   Welch was wild with delight.
   His elation grew as Barco 's seven disclosures brought to light one reward after another.
     Now did Welch truly become the man of the hour , and everything that followed in the procedure of Justice was a new triumph for him.
   It went_to his head , and his ambition increased.
     It was apparent that Welch was in cahoots with Marshall and would use his power as D._A. to drag every possible sensation into the case.
   Every new scandal which would provide more  copy  for Marshall 's pen would thus mean more publicity for Welch.
     I knew that both these cynics were waiting with_impatience for the dramatic moment when Viola was called to the stand.
   Once there , the D._A. with devilish cleverness would provide Marshall with headlines :  Viola 's Multiple_Romances  ,  Viola_Lake an Addict  ,  Downfall of Another Film_Idol !
   It would be fine publicity for the man who was willing to walk to the mayor 's throne over the broken reputation of a helpless girl!
     I studied Welch closely as the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how he might be thwarted.
   It was n't long before I sensed that there was something deeper than overvaulting ambition back of his desire for Viola 's destruction.
   He was bitter and resentful toward her , personally resentful.
   A dreadful fear entered my consciousness that perhaps he had entertained aspirations toward Viola 's favors - or , even more serious perhaps , that he had attained a share of them and had then been superseded by some luckier chap.
   I did not rest until I had tracked the mystery down.
   Well , here it is.
     One_day over a year before , there had been a cocktail_party in an apartment of a downtown hotel.
   Viola had been urged to attend , by telephone , and not knowing the host or the character of the party , she had gone.
   She arrived late and as she entered the party , noted that gentlemen seemed to be in the majority ; the air was thick_with smoke , empty bottles were in_evidence , and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor.
     Naturally , Viola had no wish to remain , but she felt she could n't leave so soon after her arrival , in_all politeness to her host.
   And it so happened that adjacent to a couch on_which she had taken refuge was a small table on_which she noted a vase of red rosebuds ; while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which , as Fate would have it , belonged_to District_Attorney Welch.
     As Viola sat there , a playful impulse overcame her to remove the shoes and socks from the unidentified feet and , as a prank , insert rosebuds between the toes.
     A_little later the district_attorney woke_up , emerged from under the couch , looked at his watch , and realized he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the Culture_Forum on  The Civic_Spirit of the Southland  , in the Byzantine room of the hotel where his wife , as president of the forum , was to preside.
   He made_his_way to his host 's bedroom where he carefully brushed himself off , neatly arranged his hair , and painstakingly selected his hat from the many on the bed.
   Then , noting neither the absence of his footwear nor the presence of the rosebuds , he made_his_way to the Byzantine room and , with his usual dignity , mounted the rostrum.
   The effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined.
     The incident , aside from reflecting on Welch 's political career , had all_but wrecked his home life.
   He never rested until he discovered who the culprit was , and when he did , he vowed vengeance on Viola_Lake if ever the chance came his way.
   And here it was!
   By such innocent actions are human tragedies sometimes set_in_motion.
     During these first days of the trial I did n't have as much time to commiserate with Viola as I should have liked.
   In_the_first_place , it was difficult for us to meet.
   We could n't be seen together , for the tongue of Scandal was ever ready_to link our names , and the tongue of Scandal finds but one thing to say of the association of a man with a girl , no_matter_how innocent.
   I could n't invite Viola to our house , for Mother snobbishly refused to receive her.
     Now the Czarship had not affected my own sense of social values , but Mother had attained a reflected glory through it , which had opened the doors of Los_Angeles-Pasadena_Society to her.
   There , Mother was received by the scions of aristocratic lines which are dominated by the Budweisers ( of beer derivation ) , the Chalmers ( of underwear origin ) , and the Heinzes ( whose forbears founded a nationally famous trade in pickles ).
   I hated being dragged into the salons of these aristocrats.
   But Mother insisted , for it is seldom indeed that anyone remotely connected with the cinema is ever received in their exclusive midsts.
   In_fact , it was not until the King of Spain had visited at Pickfair that Mary and Doug were beckoned to cross the sacred barriers which separate Los_Angeles and Pasadena from the hoi-polloi.
     Mother even went so_far as to trump_up for me matrimonial opportunities with Pasadena debs who had been educated abroad , and with those of the more lenient Los_Angeles area where a debutante was a girl who had been to high_school.
   But at_long_last came a time when I broke_away from Mother and her society  chi-chi  in_order_to spend a cosy evening with Viola and her chaperon at her home.
     However , such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during the trial , that every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered to the world , Society , and even , alas , to my own mother.
     When I arrived_at Viola 's I was shown , to my surprise , into the kitchen.
   Viola greeted me , in checked apron , ladle in_hand , and explained it was the cook 's night out and that she herself was preparing dinner.
     I sat and watched proceedings.
   There was to be roast chicken with dressing , giblet gravy , asparagus , new peas with a sprig of mint , creamed onions , and mashed potatoes - all chosen , prepared , and cooked by Viola herself.
    
    I realized that Hamlet was faced with an entirely different problem , but his agony could have been no greater.
   The_most that was accomplished was adding Mrs._Beige 's tray to the dish pile , and by means of repeated threats , on an ascending scale , seeing that the girls dressed themselves , after_a_fashion.
     I was saved from making the decision as the phone rang , and the girls were upon me instantly.
   Here 's a household hint : if you can n't find your children , and get tired of calling them , pick_up the phone.
   No_matter if your children are at the movies , in school , visiting their grandmother , or on a field trip in some distant city , they will be upon you magically within seconds after you pick_up the phone.
     Jennie and Miranda twined themselves around me , murmuring endearments.
   Louise climbed onto a stool and clutched the hand with which I was trying to hold the phone , claiming my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency.
   Somehow managing to get_out a cool , poised ,  Wo n't you hold_on a second , please  , I covered up the mouthpiece , and with more warmth and less poise , gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment , mostly the latter , including Devil 's Island and the remoter reaches of Siberia.
   I promised to illustrate the lecture , if they so_much as breathed till after the call was completed.
     Speaking into the phone again and recognizing the caller , I resumed my everyday voice.
   Soon we were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many_times by little things like Jennie 's holding her breath and pretending to black_out , Miranda 's dumping the contents of the sugar_bowl on the table , and various screeches , thuds , and giggles.
   Under_the_circumstances , I had difficulty keeping_up with the conversation on the phone , but when I hung_up I was reasonably certain that Francesca had wanted to remind me of our town_meeting the next evening , and_how important it was that Hank and I be there.
     I discovered that the girls had shrewdly vacated the kitchen , and were playing quietly in the living_room.
   It seemed that I would be the gainer if I accepted the peace and quiet , instead of carrying_out my threats.
     Resolving to get something done , I started in on the dishes.
   No.
   I 'm not saying it right.
   What I meant to say was that I started to start in on the dishes by gathering them all_together in the kitchen_sink.
   They looked so formidable , however , so demanding , that I found myself staring at them in dismay and starting to woolgather again , this time about Francesca and her husband.
   How about them , I thought.
     Francesca and Herbert were among the few people we knew in Catatonia.
   We did n't even know them till about a month after we moved - at_that_time , they had called on us , after I met Fran at a PTA meeting , and had taken us in_hand socially.
   They had been kind to us and we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinners , and for information as to where to shop , which dentist , doctor , plumber , and sitter to call ( not that there was much of a choice , since Catatonia was just a village ; the yellow_pages of the telephone_book were amazingly thin ).
     They were  personalities .
   Herb , an expert on narrow ties , thin lapels , and swatches , was men 's fashion editor of Parvenu , the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation.
   Fran and he had met about two years after she had arrived in Manhattan from Nebraska , or was it Wyoming?
   She was the daughter and sole heiress of either a cattle baron or an oil millionaire and , having arrived in New_York with a big bank roll , became a dabbler in various fields.
   She patronized Greenwich_Village artists for awhile , then put some money into a Broadway show which was successful ( terrible , but successful ).
   It was during her  writing  period that she and Herb met and decided that they were in_love.
   They were married at a lavish ceremony which was duly recorded in Parvenu and all other magazines and newspapers , and_then they honeymooned in Bermuda.
   No , not Bermuda.
   Bermuda was not in_style that year.
   They had honeymooned in Rome ; everyone was very high on Rome that year.
     They had bought their house in Catatonia after investigating all the regions of suburbia surrounding New_York ; they had chosen Catatonia because of its reputation for excellent schools , beaches , and abundance of names.
      You are bound_to get involved with people when you have children  , Fran had told me at our first meeting ,  so it is good to know that those with whom you get involved are not just dreary little housewives and dull husbands , but People Who Do Things .
     I admired their easy way of doing things but I could n't escape an uneasiness at their way of always doing the right things.
   Their house was a centuries-old Colonial which they had had restored ( guided by an eminent architect ) and updated , and added_on to.
   It had a gourmet 's corner ( instead of a kitchen ) , a breakfast room , a luncheon room , a dining_room , a sitting_room , a room for standing_up , a party room , dressing_rooms for everybody , even a room for mud.
   It was all set_up so there would be no dust anywhere and so_that their children would color in the coloring room , paint in the painting room , play with blocks in the block house , and do all the other things in the proper rooms at exactly the right time.
   Their two boys were  well adjusted  and , like their parents , always did the right thing at the right time and damn the consequences.
     Francesca and Herbert considered themselves violently nonconformist and showed the world they were by filling their Colonial house with contemporary furniture and paintings and other art objects ( expensive , but not necessarily valuable , contemporary things ).
   Fran flaunted her independence by rebelling against the Catatonia uniform of Bermuda_shorts and knee-length socks by wearing Bermuda_shorts and knee-length socks in color ; bright pinks and plaids and vivid stripes.
   Sometimes she even wore the uniform in solid , unrelieved black , and with her blonde hair cut so closely , wearing this uniform , she strongly resembled a member of the SS..
     No one could dislike them , I thought.
   Sometimes , though , they did not seem quite human.
   It seemed , indeed , that their house was not so_much a home , but rather a perfect stage_set , and that they were actors who had been handed fat roles in a successful play , and had talent enough to fill the roles competently , with nice understatement.
   Practically the only enthusiasm they showed was when they were discussing  names  ; even brand names.
   You should hear the reverence in Fran 's voice when she said  Baccarat  or  Steuben  or  Madame_Alexander .
   She always let it be known that there was wine in the pot_roast or that the chicken had been marinated in brandy , and that Koussevitzky 's second_cousin was an intimate of theirs.
     I would n't have wasted time puzzling_over this couple were it not for my fear that all the other inhabitants of Catatonia were equally unreal.
   I could n't feel at_home among them.
   Besides Francesca , there was Blanche.
   Francesca was pleasant and charming , but Blanche was sweet.
   Yes , Blanche was very , very sweet - being in her company was like being drowned in warm , melted marshmallows.
   I had once been a witness when Blanche had smiled and said with only minimum ruefulness ,  Oh , my souffle has collapsed .
   Anyone knows how a real , red-blooded woman would react to such a catastrophe!
   If Blanche had been honest , she would have yelled , slammed at_least a_couple_of doors , and thrown a_few little , valueless things.
   But dear me , no ; not Blanche.
     After five minutes with Blanche , one might welcome the astringency of Grazie , who was a sort_of Gwen_Cafritz to Francesca 's Perle_Mesta.
   Francesca and Grazie were habitual committee chairmen and they usually managed to be elected co-chairmen , equal bosses , of whatever PTA or civic project was being launched.
   They were inseparable , not because they were fond of each other , but because they wanted to keep_an_eye_on each other , as they were keen rivals for social leadership.
   Grazie was mean : quietly mean , and bitterly , unfunnily sarcastic.
   She it was who had looked to see if I was wearing shoes upon learning that I could n't drive.
   Grazie had a small , slick head and her hair and skin were the color of golden toast.
   She lived in an ultra-modern house whose decoration , appointments , paint , and even pets were chosen to complement her coloring ; the pets were a_couple_of Siamese_cats.
   Her uniform was of rich , raw silk , in a shade which matched her hair , skin , housepaint , and cats , and since she was so thin as to be almost shapeless , she rather resembled a frozen fish_stick.
     The husbands of these women and_others I had met in Catatonia were distinguished only in_that they were , to me at_least , indistinguishable.
   I could n't tell one from the other.
   Like Herbert , they were all_in communications : radio , television , magazines , and advertising.
   One or two were writers of books ; all were fellows of finite charm.
   Each had developed a hair-trigger chuckle and the habit of saying  zounds !
 in deference to country-squirehood.
   I never thought I 'd live to hear people chuckle and say  zounds !
 in real_life.
   I would n't have missed it for_anything.
   They were  sincere  - men of the too-hearty handclasp and the urgent smile.
   These boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently pressing one of his hands in both of theirs , while they gazed , misty-eyed with care , into the eyes of the person they were meeting.
   Could such unadulterated love , for a total stranger , be credited?
   They were always leaping to light cigarettes , open car_doors , fill plates or glasses , and I mistrusted the whole lot of them to the same degree that I mistrusted bake shops that called themselves  Sanitary_Bake Shops .
      O Pioneers!
    I thought , and wondered what kind_of homesteads such odd pioneers would establish in_this suburban frontier ; pioneers who looked_like off-duty gardeners even at parent-teacher conferences and who never called the school_principal  Mister .
   I sighed , thinking that among_other_things , people here seemed to be those who would have to cut_down if they earned less_than $ 85000 yearly ; people who would give their teeth for a chance to get_on  Person to Person  ; people who thought it was nice to be important , but not important to be nice ; who were more ingratiating than gracious , more personalities than persons.
   In my estimation , they were people who read Daphne_du_Maurier , and discussed Kafka ; well , not discussed him exactly , but said ,  Kafka !
   reverently and raised their eyes , as if they were at_a_loss to describe how they felt about Kafka , which they were , because they had no opinions about Kafka , not having read Kafka.
   They were , I felt , people invariably trying to prove not who , but what they were , and trying to determine what , not who , others were.
     Becoming aware that it was nearly lunchtime , I brought myself back to the tasks at_hand.
   I made plans for the afternoon - doing the breakfast and luncheon dishes all_at_once , making the beds , and_then maybe painting the kitchen.
   Then , I remembered that the girls had had a banana for dessert every_day for the last week.
    Bananas !
   Jennie had shouted each time.
    They 're not dessert!
   They 're not even food.
   They 're just something you 're supposed to put on cereal for breakfast .
   I dug around and found a mix , and was able to surprise them with a devil 's - food cake with chocolate icing.
   ( Sometimes I think you need only one rule for cooking :   if you can n't put garlic in it , put chocolate in it.
 )     The cake was received in a stunned silence that was evidence in itself of the dearth of taste thrills Mama had been providing.
   Then Jennie closed her eyes , stretched_forth her arms , and said :  Take my hand , Louise ; I 'm a stranger in paradise .
    
    Needless to say , I was furious at this unparalleled intrusion upon free_enterprise.
   How dared they demand to  snoop  in_private financial records , disbursements , confidential contracts and agreements?
    It is as though  , I said on the historic three-hour , coast-to-coast radio_broadcast which I bought ( following Father_Coughlin and pre_empting the Eddie_Cantor , Manhattan_Merry-go-round and Major_Bowes shows )  That Man in the White_House , like some despot of yore , insisted on reading my diary , raiding my larder and ransacking my lingerie!
    My impassioned plea for civil_rights created a landslide of correspondence and one sponsor even asked me to consider replacing the Eddie_Cantor comedy hour on a permanent basis.
   But what quarter could a poor defenseless woman expect from a dictator who would even make so bold as to close all_of the banks in our great nation?
   The savage barbarian hordes of red Russian_Communism descended on the Athens that was mighty Metronome , sacking and despoiling with their Bolshevistic battle cry of  Soak the rich '!
   After an unspeakable siege , lasting the better part of two months , it was announced that the studio  owed  the government a tax debt in_excess of eight million dollars while I , who had always remained aloof from such iniquitous practices as paying taxes on the salary I had earned and the little I legally inherited as Morris ' helpless relict , was  stung  with a personal bill of such astronomical proportions as to  wipe_out  all_but a fraction of my poor , hard-come-by savings.
   I was also publicly reprimanded , dragged_through_the_mud by the radical press and made a figure of fun by such leftist publications as The New_Republic , The New_Yorker , Time and the Christian_Science Monitor.
     It was then that I availed myself of the rights of a citizen and declared the income_tax unconstitutional.
   The litigation was costly and seemingly endless.
   I fought like a tigress but by the time I appealed my case to the Supreme_Court ( 1937 ) , Mr._Roosevelt and his  henchmen  had done their  dirty work  all_too well , even going so_far as to attempt to  pack  the highest tribunal in the land in_order_to defeat little me.
   Presidential coercion had succeeded not_only in poisoning the courtiers ,  toadies  and sycophants of the  bench  against me , but it had been so far-reaching as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from representing me!
   I was ready , like Portia , to present my own brief.
   But the Supreme_Court would n't even hear my case!
   My plea was unanimously voted_down and  thrown_out .
   Again , my name was_on all the front pages.
   I was , it seemed , persona_non_grata in every_quarter , but not entirely without a staunch following of noted political thinkers and students of jurisprudence.
   As Charles_Evans_Hughes said ,  Miss_Poitrine 's limitations as an actress are exceeded only by her logic as a litigant .
   Albert_Einstein was quoted as saying :  The workings of the woman 's mind amaze me .
   Henry_Ford spoke of me as  utterly astounding .
   Heywood_Broun wrote :  Belle_Poitrine is the_most original thinker since Caligula  , and even F._D._R. had to concede that  if the rest of_this nation showed the foresight and patriotism of Miss_Poitrine , America would rapidly resemble ancient Babylon and Nineveh .
     Not_only were the court costs prohibitive , but I was subjected to crippling fines , in_addition to usurious interest on the unpaid  debts  which the governmen claimed that Metronome and I owed - a severe financial blow.
   Nor , as Manny said , had the notoriety done my career  any good .
   My enemies were only_too anxious to level against me such charges as  reactionary  ,  robber baroness  , and even  traitor !
   Traitor indeed!
   I point now with_pride to the fact that , long ere the Committee on Un-American_Activities , the Minute_Women , the Economic_Council and other such notable  watchdog  organizations were so_much as heard of , I was Hollywood 's leading bulwark against communism , fighting single-handedly  creeping socialism  against such insuperable odds as the Fascio-Communist troops of the NRA , PWA , WPA , CCC and an army of more_than twenty-two million mercenaries whom F._D._R. employed secretly , through the transparent ruse of regular  relief  checks.
     Needless to say , my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period.
   Could it do otherwise?
   Even_though I have always had a genius for  throwing myself into  every role and  playing it for all it 's worth  , no actress can be expected to do her best work when her fortune , her reputation , her livelihood , her home and her nation itself are all imperilled.
   Such sweeping distractions are hardly conducive to  Oscar  winning performances.
   I tried my hardest , with little help , may I say , from my husband and leading_man , but somehow the outside pressures were too severe.
     Having ( through my unflagging effort and devotion ) achieved stardom , a fortune and a world-renowned wife at an age when most young_men are casting their first vote , Letch proceeded to neglect them all.
   Never a  quick study  , he now made no attempt to learn his  lines  and many_a mile of film was wasted , many_a scene - sometimes involving as_many as a_thousand fellow thespians - was taken thirty , forty , fifty times because Miss_Poitrine 's co-star and  helpmate  had never learned his part.
   Each time Letch  went_up  in his  lines  , I was the one to be patient , helpful and apologetic while he indulged in outbursts of temperament , profanity and abuse , blaming others , going into  sulks  and , on more occasions than I care to count , storming off the  set  for the rest of the day.
   As for his finances , I was never privileged to know exactly how much money Letch had  salted_away .
   It was I who paid for our little home , the food , the liquor , the servants - even Letch 's bills at his tailor and the Los_Angeles Athletic_Club.
   Never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third anniversary he gave me a dislocated jaw.
   ( But that is another story.
 )   As for his private monies , they were rapidly dissipated in drinking , gaming and carousing.
   More_than once I was confronted by professional gamblers ,  bookies  , loan  sharks  , gangsters ,  thugs  and  finger men  - people of a class I did not even know existed - to repay my husband 's staggering losses ,  or_else .
   I shuddered to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with such a sinister milieu.
   And at three different times during our turbulent marriage strange girls , with the commonest of accents , telephoned to announce to me that Letch had sired their unborn children!
   Having the deepest of maternal instincts , my heart fairly bled when I thought_of the darling pink and white  bundles from heaven  I would have proudly given my husband.
    Ah , you 're too old  , was invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever I suggested  starting a family .
   Letch had made it abundantly clear that he did not care_for the company of my own precious daughter.
   I now felt it wiser_to keep Baby-dear in school and - during the summers - at a camp run by the Society_of_Friends all year around.
   Her presence only made Letch more distant and irritable and , in the hurry of buying Chateau_Belletch , I had neglected to consider a room for Baby-dear , so there was no place to put her , anyhow.
   ( I sometimes feel that God , in His infinite wisdom , wants us to have these inexplicable little lapses of memory.
   It almost always works_out for the best.
 )     Yet I adored this man , Letch_Feeley , why , I cannot say.
   With faint heart and a brave smile , I endured his long absences from Chateau_Belletch , his coldness , his indifference , his slights and his abuse.
   The times I can recall when I was publicly humiliated by him - lovely dinner_parties in our Trianon Suite where the collation was postponed and postponed and postponed , only to be served dry and overcooked at a table where the host 's chair was vacant ; a  splash party  at the new pool , which I had built in the hope of keeping Letch away from public beaches , when Letch and a certain Aquacutie stayed underwater together for the better part of an hour ; a lovely Epiphany party at Errol_Flynn 's , on_which sacred occasion Letch stole_away with an unknown  starlet  , leaving me  high and dry  to get home as best I could.
   These are but a sampling of the insults I endured.
   As Mrs._Letch_Feeley , was it any wonder that I , once the social arbiter of Filmdom , was excluded from the smart entertainments given by the Astaires , the Coopers , the Gables , the Colmans , the Rathbones , the Taylors , the Thalbergs and such devout , closely_knit families as the Barrymores and the Crosbys?
   As Letch 's antisocial conduct increased , our invitations decreased and my heart was in my mouth whenever I played hostess at a fashionable  screenland  gathering.
     Between 1935 and 1939 Letch and I made ten films together , each less successful , both artistically and commercially , than the one before it.
   Our last joint_venture , Sainted_Lady , a deeply religious film based on the life of Mother_Cabrini , and timed so_that its release date would coincide with the beatification of America 's first saint in November , 1938 , was a fiasco from_start_to_finish.
   As I was playing Mother_Cabrini , the picture was actually  all mine  , with nearly every scene built around me.
   But in_order_to keep Letch in_the_public_eye and out of trouble , I wrote in a part especially for him - that of a dashing ruffian who  sees the light  and is saved by the inspiring example of Mother_Cabrini.
   And did he appreciate my efforts on his behalf?
   Did he trouble to memorize the very small part which I had  tailor-made  to his specifications , a role eventually cut_down to three short speeches?
   Did he show the rest of the cast - numbering four thousand - the consideration of arriving_at the studio punctually - or even at_all?
   He did not!
   The  shooting  went_on for eight months!
   Most_of our working_days were spent on the telephone calling  bookies  , illegal gambling_dens , a certain  residential club for young_actresses  , more_than a_hundred different bars or the steam_room of the athletic club.
   Whenever he deigned to appear at the studio he was  hung_over  , uncooperative , rude and insulting.
   He made many tasteless , irreverent and unfunny remarks , not_only about me in the title_role , but about religion in_general.
   By the time the film was released we were three million dollars over-spent , war was imminent and the public apparently had forgotten all about Mother_Cabrini.
   Thanks to Letch_Feeley and the terrible strain he imposed on me , the notices were few and unfavorable.
   Only George_Santayana seemed to understand and appreciate the film when he wrote :  Miss_Poitrine has perpetrated the_most eloquent argument for the Protestant faith yet unleashed by Hollywood .
   But it was small consolation.
     In a rare fit of anger and spite , I  farmed_out  my own husband to a small and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment.
   ( An actor must have discipline.
 )   The film was called The Diet of Worms , which I felt was just what Letch deserved.
   It turned_out to be a life of Martin_Luther , of all things!
   It was a disaster!
   In clothes , Letch simply did not project.
   He was laughed_off the screen.
   At_the_same_time , however , I availed myself of the services of_that great English actor and master of make-up , Sir_Gauntley_Pratt , to do a  quickie  called The Mystery of the Mad_Marquess , in_which I played a young American girl who inherits a haunted castle on the_English moors which is filled with secret passages and sliding panels and , unbeknownst to anyone , is still occupied by an eccentric maniac.
   It was a  potboiler  made on a  shoestring  and not the sort_of film I like , as all I had to do was look blank and scream a great_deal.
   My heart was not in it , but , oddly_enough , it remains the_most financially successful picture of my career.
   ( I watched it on television late one night last week and it  stands_up  remarkably well , even twenty years later.
 )     Letch had returned from his debacle unrepentant and more badly_behaved than before.
   I really loved that boy , and , in a feverish attempt to preserve our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful , wonderful person Letch had once been , I took my troubles to Momma , hoping that her earthy advice would help me.
      If I could only think_of something at the studio , near me , to absorb his boundless energy  , I said.
    What is Letch interested in ?
      Bookies , booze and babes  , Momma said bluntly.
     Her reply stung me , but this was too important to let my hurt make any difference.
    I can n't turn the studio into a gambling_hell or a saloon  , I said.
